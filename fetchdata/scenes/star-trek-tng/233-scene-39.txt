[School room]

(the classroom seven computer interface is a
talking fish with a male voice) 
COMPUTER: Hello. I'm the classroom computer system. What can I do for
you, today? 
PICARD JR: Computer, display interior security grid. 
COMPUTER: I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Would you like to play a
game? 
PICARD JR: No, I would not. Computer, display an internal schematic
diagram. 
COMPUTER: I'm sorry, but I can't do that. Would you like to see some
interesting plants or animals? 
GUINAN JR: It's a child's computer, remember? Computer, can you show me
a picture of the inside of the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: Yes, I can. The Enterprise is a Galaxy-class starship. Do you
know how to spell Enterprise? E N T E 
PICARD JR: Delete audio. All right, this'll have to do. We're here.
there's a service conduit that runs to here and then leads to a
Jeffries tube here. But you and Ensign Ro will still have to cross this
corridor before you can get to main Engineering. 
(Ro and Keiko take the hatch off the crawlway) 
RO JR: Captain. 
PICARD JR: Excellent. Ready? Make it so. 
(Ro and Guinan crawl in, then Picard's leg is hit by a large
radio-controlled toy vehicle) 
PICARD: What the devil? 
ALEXANDER: I was just playing. I'm sorry, Captain. 
PICARD JR: Alexander, would you mind if I borrowed your toy for a
little while? 
ALEXANDER: Go ahead. 
PICARD JR: Thank you. 
(he puts it in the crawlway) 
PICARD: After you. 
(Keiko enters the crawlway and Picard follows)

[Transporter room]

(the toy runs into the room, bumps against the
Ferengi's foot, then leaves again. The Ferengi follows it)

[Corridor]

(Picard and Keiko see the Ferengi leave, and go
into the transporter room)

[Transporter room]

KEIKO JR: I've got the phasers, Captain. 
(the pair leave just before the Ferengi comes back round the corner
carrying the toy and tries to make it work)

[Jefferies tube]

RO JR: This is the first time these Jefferies tubes
haven't seemed cramped. 
GUINAN JR:: How much farther do we have to go? 
RO JR: About fifty metres. Don't tell me you're tired. 
GUINAN JR: I'm not as young as I used to be.

[Crusher's office]

(Alexander knocks on the glass and runs away. The
Ferengi gives chase) 
[Sickbay]

(Alexander gets some hypos from a drawer)

[Jefferies tube]

(the girls climb down a short ladder) 
RO JR: This is it. Main Engineering. Now we wait.
