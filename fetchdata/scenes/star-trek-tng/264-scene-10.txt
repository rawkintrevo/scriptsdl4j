[Pegasus Engineering]

(one of the bulkheads is rock and there are bodies
around) 
PRESSMAN: This room was open to space for twelve years. 
RIKER: Vacuum preserved everything. 
(Pressman switches on the lights) 
RIKER: I wonder how many of the crew are buried back there. 
PRESSMAN: We're not here for a memorial service. (he opens a panel)
It's still intact. What's the matter, Will? Don't you understand? We've
found it. 
RIKER: I know. I kept hoping it wouldn't be here. That it had been
destroyed or that it was buried in that rock back there. 
PRESSMAN: What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
RIKER: It means that I can't put this off any longer. Right up until
this moment I had the luxury of time, but now I've got to make a
choice. And, Admiral, I'm afraid my choice is this. I can't let you
start these experiments again. It was wrong twelve years ago, and it is
wrong today. 
PRESSMAN: You had better reconsider that position, Commander. We have a
mission to accomplish and you're going to carry it out. 
RIKER: That's all you care about, starting these damn experiments
again. Look around. This room is filled with dead bodies. These people
died because of this thing. 
PRESSMAN: Keep your self-righteous comments to yourself. I knew most of
these people a lot longer than you did. Yes, it was tragic, but it was
their fault. 
RIKER: You don't know that. Neither of us knows what happened after we
left. 
PRESSMAN: Well, it's not hard to guess. They tried to shut down an
experiment they didn't understand. Something went wrong and it killed
them. 
RIKER: No. We killed them. 
PRESSMAN: Now that doesn't sound like the same man who grabbed a phaser
and defended his captain twelve years ago. 
RIKER: I've had twelve years to think about it, and if I had it to do
over again I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you
instead of them. 
PRESSMAN: So on reflection you'd rather be a traitor than a hero. 
RIKER: I wasn't a hero and neither were you. What you did was wrong and
I was wrong to support you, but I was just too young and too stupid to
realise it. You were the captain. I was the ensign. I was just
following orders. 
PRESSMAN: And if you hadn't you'd be dead right now along with all the
rest of them. Dead because you listened to a bunch of mutinous cowards
who were too blinded by fear to see what I was trying to do. 
RIKER: They were brave enough to risk their lives to stop you from
violating a treaty the Federation signed in good faith. 
PRESSMAN: That treaty has bound our hands and given the Romulans a
tactical advantage for the last sixty years. I was simply trying to
level the playing field. 
RIKER: And now you want to try it again? How many people will die this
time? Fifty? A hundred? A thousand? 
PRESSMAN: All right, you don't want to help me? Fine. But you are still
under my direct orders not to talk about what you know and I expect you
to follow those orders to the letter. I made you, mister, and I can
break you just as easily. Do you understand me, Commander? 
(the ship shakes) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to away team. Prepare to return to the ship
immediately. 
PRESSMAN: Stand by, Enterprise. 
(he gets the device out) 
PRESSMAN: Pressman to Enterprise. Two people and one piece of equipment
to beam up.
