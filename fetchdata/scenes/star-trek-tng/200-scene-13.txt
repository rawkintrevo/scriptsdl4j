[Great Hall]

K'TAL: naDev ghoS! 
(Picard walks forward) 
K'TAL: Have you reached a decision regarding the succession of power? 
PICARD: Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Doj
hon. Doj hon. 
K'TAL: Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em. The Arbiter confirms that you
have completed the Rite of Succession. Your enemies have been
destroyed. You stand alone. Do you wish to claim leadership of the
Council? 
GOWRON: I wish it. 
K'TAL: Are there no other challengers? 
(just as Picard is about to put the cloak on Gowron's shoulders) 
TORAL: There is one. I will challenge him. 
GOWRON: An arrogant child! 
K'TAL: Who are you? 
TORAL: I am Toral, son of Duras. 
GOWRON: Duras had no son. 
B'ETOR: But he did, Gowron. 
GOWRON: So, this is your doing, Lursa. 
LURSA: We wish to address the Council. 
K'TAL: Lursa, B'Etor, come forward. 
LURSA: Members of the High Council, it is a day of great rejoicing for
the family of Duras and the Klingon Empire. We have discovered that our
brother did indeed have a son and heir. 
GOWRON: This is outrageous. Duras had no mate. Where did you find him,
Lursa? In a harlot's bedchamber? 
TORAL: I will personally cut your tongue out, Yintagh! 
GOWRON: Impudent wretch. 
B'ETOR: A simple genetic scan will prove his bloodline is valid. 
GOWRON: The illegitimate son of Duras cannot rule the High Council. 
K'TAL: The Arbiter will consider his validity. Len'mat.

[Duras home]

(the sisters have Romulan visitors) 
LURSA: Our allies on the Council backed Toral's claim. It's in Picard's
hands, now. 
MOVAR: Excellent. Everything is proceeding as scheduled. 
TORAL: Why not just kill Picard? 
B'ETOR: Fool! Do we want the Federation as our enemy? 
TORAL: No. 
(and from the shadows, that familiar voice again) 
WOMAN: At least, not yet. But when the time is right we will deal with
the Federation and Captain Picard.

[Worf's quarters]

KURN [on monitor]: I have met with the other
squadron commanders here. Three will join us, one will not. That gives
us enough strength to control seven key sectors. 
WORF: Do you know the strength of our enemies? 
KURN [on monitor]: They have at least seven squadrons, but most of the
fleet has not decided which banner to follow. 
WORF: Gowron is nearly out of options. Soon he will have no choice 
KURN [on monitor]: I will return soon to the home world. We shall meet
then.

[Bridge]

DATA: Do you also require the original logs
recorded during the attack, Lieutenant? 
WORF: Everything we have on the Khitomer massacre. 
DATA: We can provide you with our analysis of the communications
between the Khitomer outpost and the Romulan ships. However, for a
complete record you will have to contact Starbase twenty four 
PICARD: Mister Worf. Have you cancelled your leave? 
WORF: No, sir. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, would you join me in my Ready room?
