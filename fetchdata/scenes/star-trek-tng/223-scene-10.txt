CRUSHER: I'm afraid we've turned that corner
already.
WORF: Kill it now. Make it appear that it died in the crash. 
[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: Leave no evidence that we were ever
here. 
PICARD: Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Thank you, Captain. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, notify Security to prepare a detention cell.
Bridge to Engineering.
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need to
neutralise the homing signal 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Prevent it from sending or receiving
transmissions of any kind.
LAFORGE: I'll set up a subspace damping field around the detention
cell. 
PICARD [OC]: Very well. 
[Crash site]

WORF: Four more. None survived.
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker.
RIKER: Go ahead, Enterprise.

[Bridge]

PICARD: We are transporting you directly to the
detention cell.
CRUSHER [OC]: I need him in Sickbay, Captain.
PICARD: The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be brought
to you there.
CRUSHER [OC]: Very well. 
(Picard goes to his Ready room, and Troi follows)

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come.
TROI: Captain, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talk
about.
PICARD: I don't think so, Counsellor.
TROI: I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir some
feelings.
PICARD: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you.
TROI: Sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are
residual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violently
by the Borg. 
Kidnapped, assaulted,
mutilated. 
PICARD: Counsellor. Counsellor, I very much appreciate your concern for
me, but I can assure you it is quite misplaced. I have carefully
considered the implications of having a Borg on this
ship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced that we are
doing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable with my decision.
TROI: I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more.
PICARD: I shall certainly avail myself of your help.
