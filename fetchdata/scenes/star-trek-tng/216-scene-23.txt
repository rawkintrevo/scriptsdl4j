TROI RUSSELL WORF PICARD RIKER OGAWA CRUSHER ALEXANDER

[Worf's private room]

ALEXANDER: We started doing multiplications today.
The teacher said I'm faster than anybody else in my class. 
(Alyssa enters) 
WORF: We will speak again soon. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, Father. 
(Alexander leaves) 
WORF: If I die, he must be cared for. 
TROI: I'll make sure he reaches your parents' home safely. 
WORF: No. They are elderly. They cannot care for Alexander. Counsellor,
I have a serious request to make of you. Would you consider? 
TROI: You want me to raise Alexander? 
WORF: I have come to have a great respect for you, Deanna. You have
been most helpful in guiding me since Alexander's arrival. I can't
imagine anyone who would be a better parent to my son. If it is too
much to ask. 
TROI: I'd be honoured. 
(Troi leaves) 
WORF: I am ready.

[Operating theatre]

(Worf is face down. Alyssa is the scrub nurse) 
RUSSELL: Focus the drechtal beams on the anterior and posterior spinal
roots. 
CRUSHER: Focused. 
RUSSELL: Initiate. 
CRUSHER: All neural connections below the first cervical vertebrae have
been separated. 
RUSSELL: Microtome. I'm severing the brain stem now. 
OGAWA: Cerebral cortex placed on life support at zero eight thirty one
hours. Three hours twenty six minutes remaining until onset of primary
brain dysfunction. 
RUSSELL: Okay, let's remove the support frame. 
CRUSHER: Exoscalpel.

[Ready room]

RIKER: I've notified Starfleet that our survey of
sector three seven six two eight will be delayed at least a week while
we drop off survivors from the Denver. 
PICARD: Good. I understand from Mister La Forge there's a minor
fluctuation in the starboard warp coil. 
RIKER: I've scheduled a stress simulation routine for this afternoon to
check it out. Has there been any word? 
PICARD: No.

[Operating theatre]

(Worf's new spinal cord is in a plastic box) 
CRUSHER: Preliminary genetronic scans are complete. 
RUSSELL: Initiating DNA sequencer. 
CRUSHER: Reading the initial sequences at ten to the ninth base pairs
per second. 
RUSSELL: Once we're past the first two levels, we'll begin the encoding
sequence. Increase TCH levels to 
(an alarm beeps) 
CRUSHER: What's happened? 
RUSSELL: The scanner is having trouble reading the Klingon dorsal root
ganglia. 
CRUSHER: Did this show up in your simulations? 
RUSSELL: Yes, but I thought I'd made sufficient adjustments. Bring me
the detronal scanner. I can scan the ganglia manually. It'll just take
a little longer. 
OGAWA: One hour forty three minutes until primary brain dysfunction. 
(Troi is trying to keep Alexander amused while all this is going on) 
(Alyssa hands over a tray with a length of jelly in it) 
RUSSELL: Retract the paraspinal muscle. 
CRUSHER: Got it. Watch the proximal nerve endings. 
RUSSELL: I see them. Make sure the cranial segment is at least fifteen
centimetres from the brain stem. 
OGAWA: I'm reading a slight fluctuation in the isocortex. 
CRUSHER: Twenty cc's inoprovaline. 
RUSSELL: Okay. Release retractors on the paraspinal. How much longer
can we keep him on life support? 
OGAWA: Twenty seven minutes. 
RUSSELL: Cover. Close, please. 
CRUSHER: Ready. 
RUSSELL: Tissue growth proceeding at anticipated rates. No initial
signs of rejection.
(Alexander has fallen asleep on Troi's lap) 
RUSSELL: Okay. Ready. Terminate life support. 
OGAWA: Life support disengaged. 
RUSSELL: Neural connections appear stable. 
CRUSHER: Looking good so far. 
OGAWA: Fluctuations in the isocortex. 
CRUSHER: Forty cc's inoprovaline. 
RUSSELL: Synaptic response falling. 
OGAWA: BP dropping. Now sixty over ten. VeK'tal response falling
rapidly. 
CRUSHER: Increase oxygen mixture to ninety five percent. 
RUSSELL: Beginning direct synaptic stimulation. 
OGAWA: Respiration is shallow and rapid. No response in the isocortex. 
CRUSHER: Seventy five cc's inoprovaline. 
OGAWA: Heart rate is erratic. 
RUSSELL: He's going into cardiac arrest. 
CRUSHER: All right, let's go to chloromydride. Fifteen cc's. 
RUSSELL: We're losing him. No BP, no pulse. Brain activity? 
OGAWA: Showing no higher brain functions. 
CRUSHER: All right twenty five cc's cordrazine. 
RUSSELL: That'll kill him. 
CRUSHER: Looks like we've done a pretty good job of that already,
Doctor. 
OGAWA: No BP, no pulse. No activity in the isocortex. 
CRUSHER: Cortical stimulator. Now. Again. Again. Again. Again. 
RUSSELL: Doctor. 
CRUSHER: All right, make a note in the log. Death occurred at twelve
hundred forty hours. 
RUSSELL: It was all going so well. No anomalies during replication, no
initial rejection.

[Sickbay]

(Crusher enters) 
TROI: No. 
CRUSHER: Alexander, I am so sorry. 
ALEXANDER: I want to see him. 
TROI: Alex. 
ALEXANDER: No! I want to see him.
