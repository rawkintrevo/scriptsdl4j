(Kate is passing by when she spots Wesley loitering
with intent, and a PADD) 
PULASKI: Wes? 
WESLEY: Hi, Doctor Pulaski. 
PULASKI: You have trouble behind that door? 
WESLEY: My team's in there. I've got to assign planets, set a schedule.

PULASKI: It sounds like you've got everything under control. 
WESLEY: I haven't had to deal with them yet. Not together, not
professionally. 
PULASKI: Wes, the minute you walk through that door they're your team.
You have nothing to prove. You've got the authority. 
WESLEY: That's just 'cos Commander Riker says I do. 
PULASKI: It's up to you to hang on to it. Now, you'd better get in
there, and Wes, for whatever it's worth, I think you're going to do
just fine. 
Captain's log, stardate 42737.3. It has been six
weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema sector. Each system
has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet.

HILDEBRANDT: (the woman on the team) It seems to be
at this point we can expect the greatest tectonic stresses. 
WESLEY: I agree. Nice job. 
DAVIES: Here are the results of my scan on the third Selcundi system.
It's just the same old song. 
WESLEY: Didn't you tell me that UV absorptions like these are
indicative of traker deposits? 
DAVIES: And where there's traker there's generally dilithium? Yes, I
did. 
WESLEY: So don't you think we ought to run an ico-spectrogram? 
DAVIES: Well, Wes, these traker readings are really faint. It's
probably just a fool's echo. 
WESLEY: I think I'd still run an ico-gram. 
HILDEBRANDT: Wesley, it's a major undertaking to set up the scanner. 
DAVIES: We're looking at five hours minimum. 
WESLEY: I know, I know. I don't want to do a half way job. 
DAVIES: Wes, there's being thorough and then there's wasting time. It's
also the mark of a good officer to recognise the difference. 
WESLEY: Maybe you're right.

DATA: Computer, please access all volcanic and
tectonic plate activity in Drema Four. 
COMPUTER: Accessing. 
DATA: Computer, locate Captain Picard. 
COMPUTER: Captain Picard is on holodeck three.

(Picard has finally got out for a canter on his
Arab steed) 
PICARD: Data? 
DATA: An excellent steed, sir. Sorry to disturb you, Captain. 
PICARD: It's quite all right. It must be important, or you wouldn't be
here. 
DATA: Yes, sir, it is important. Very. Eight weeks ago I received a
transmission, a simple four word message, 'Is anybody out there?' I
answered it. 
PICARD: There is a loneliness inherent in that whisper from the
darkness. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I am glad that you understand, sir. 
PICARD: But it didn't end there. 
DATA: No, sir. We speak often. It is a young female, humanoid. 
PICARD: Her society is aware that there is interstellar life? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Oops. Just where does she think you're calling from? 
DATA: I have kept that somewhat vague, sir, but Sarjenka, that is her
name, has been quite specific, telling me details of her family and
friends. And interspersed among these confidences have been some
alarming references. 
PICARD: Go on. 
DATA: Drema Four has been enduring the same geological stresses we have
found in the other systems. 
PICARD: Then your friend is in trouble. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: What are you proposing? 
DATA: If we can determine the cause of these geological disturbances,
we might be able to reverse the process. 
PICARD: Violate the Prime Directive? 
DATA: I was hoping that you might have another option, sir. 
PICARD: We don't even know if this catastrophe is preventable. Call a
conference in my quarters. All senior staff. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: And Data, all communication with this life form must cease. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I understand, sir.
