[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: But no colours. 
DATA: Increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance. 
LAFORGE: Ah, that's better. 
CRUSHER: Your pulse has gone up. Your nervous system probably has to
get used to the input levels. 
LAFORGE: I'm excited, that's all, Doctor. This is like being on a
roller coaster. Or a first date. I'm all right. 
CRUSHER: I'll be the judge of that. If your heart rate gets too high,
we're going to disconnect you. 
LAFORGE: Understood. 
[Raman corridor]

LAFORGE: It's a mess in here. There must be a
breach in the hull someplace. I'm picking up atmospheric gasses in the
corridor. Methane and ammonia, primarily. That break in the hull might
even be on the Bridge itself.
I'm heading towards the Bridge. I've found someone. 
DATA [OC]: What is your position? 
LAFORGE: About twelve metres up the main corridor. He's trapped under
some conduit from the bulkhead. I can't move it. I'm going to need more
power to the tractor beam. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Go to eighty percent of tolerance, Data. No higher. 
(Geordi pulls off a metal bar and checks the man's pulse) 
LAFORGE: He's dead. Data, that door at the end of this corridor. What's
it lead to? 
DATA [OC]: A magnetic storage bay. 
LAFORGE: If there was a break in the Bridge, that'd be the safest place
to go. Data, give me a phaser burst. Narrow focus, level four
intensity. 
(Geordi blows the lock off the door) 
LAFORGE: I've found them. They're dead. All of them. There's a fire in
here. Argh!

[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: Data, disconnect! What happened? Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. My hands. 
CRUSHER: They're burned. 
[Sickbay]

(Geordi's hands are in the healing box) 
PICARD: How did this happen? 
CRUSHER: There was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit.

PICARD: But shouldn't the safety overrides have prevented that? 
CRUSHER: Yes, but I have a theory why they didn't. The tolerance levels
of the interface were set extremely high. I think Geordi's neural
response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop. 
LAFORGE: The sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my
hands must've overloaded. 
PICARD: The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve them
and their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk. 
LAFORGE: If we turn down the sensory input on the probe, I should be
fine. Seven people lost their lives down there, Captain. We should at
least retrieve the information they were collecting. 
PICARD: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: If we operate the interface at lower input levels, I'd say the
risk is acceptable. 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PICARD: We will proceed with the probe. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: We'll have to take it into the Raman's
auxiliary control room. Their Bridge is too badly damaged.
