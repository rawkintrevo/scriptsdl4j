RIKER WORF SHELBY PICARD GLEASON DATA

[Bridge]

RIKER: Slow to impulse. Take us to the battle
coordinates, Mister Crusher. Yellow alert. 
WORF: Sensors are picking up several vessels, Captain. 
RIKER: The fleet?
DATA: No active subspace fields. Negligible power readings. 
RIKER: Life signs? 
DATA: Negative, sir.
WORF: Visual contact.
RIKER: On screen.
(Fragments of starships, some with flashes of fires still burning) 
SHELBY: The Tolstoy, the Kyushu, the Melbourne. 
(Riker bows his head briefly for the crew that might have been his) 
WORF: Sir, sensors are picking up unusually strong eddy currents,
bearing two zero zero, mark two one one.
RIKER: Data, analysis? 
DATA: It could indicate the course of the Borg ship, sir. 
RIKER: Ensign Crusher, set in a course that follows those currents.
Commander Shelby, prepare to initiate your plan to separate the saucer
section when we find the Borg.
SHELBY: Sir. I must remind you that Captain Picard was briefed on that
plan. The Borg will be prepared for it 
RIKER: I'm aware of that, Commander. In fact, I'm counting on it.
SHELBY: Crusher, Cartaino, Gleason. Report to the Battle Bridge. 
RIKER: Mister Data, Mister Worf? I have a special mission for you.

[Borg ship]

(The Borg ship drops out of warp. A fully Borgified
Picard looks at the Enterprise approaching) 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Locutus of Borg, this is Captain William T.
Riker of the USS Enterprise.
PICARD: You may speak.

[Battle bridge]

RIKER: We wish to end the hostilities.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Then you must unconditionally surrender.
RIKER: We are prepared to meet to discuss your terms.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: It is unlikely you are prepared to discuss
terms. It is more likely that this is an attempt at deception.
RIKER: Come now, Locutus. If Picard's knowledge and experience is part
of you, then you know I've never lied to him. You should also
implicitly trust me, is that not so?
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Picard implicitly trusted you.
RIKER: Then trust me now. Meet to discuss terms.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Discussion is irrelevant. There are no terms.
You will disarm all your weapons and escort us to Sector zero zero one
where we will begin assimilating your culture and technology.
(mute) 
RIKER: Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint the source of the Borg
transmission?
GLEASON: I can put you within thirty meters of it, sir. 
RIKER: O'Brien, report.
