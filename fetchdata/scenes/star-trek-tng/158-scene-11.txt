[Ready room]

DATA: As the probe went into orbit around Nelvana
Three, it began picking up low level subspace radio emissions. 
PICARD: Could they be naturally occurring? 
DATA: No, sir. The patterns are clearly artificial. 
LAFORGE: The signal was so faint our ship sensors couldn't read it from
this distance. 
PICARD: Can we decode it? 
LAFORGE: We've tried. It's probably Romulan but we can't be sure. We've
also picked up ionisation disturbances. 
DATA: Cloaked Romulan ships could produce that effect. 
PICARD: What about the planet surface? 
LAFORGE: Reading nothing but barren rock. I don't know. They might be
able to hide a base from our probe. Its capabilities are limited. The
only way we'll know for sure is if we go and take a look for ourselves.

PICARD: That'll be all, gentlemen.

(Data is at a table, staring at Setal sitting by
the window) 
GUEST3: I take it you have never seen a Romulan before. 
DATA: That would be an incorrect assumption. 
GUEST3: Then why do you invade my privacy? 
DATA: I was attempting to ascertain what my guts tell me about you. 
GUEST3: You're the android. I know a host of Romulan cyberneticists that
would love to be this close to you. 
DATA: I do not find that concept particularly appealing. 
GUEST3: Nor should you. 
DATA: I am told by various crewmembers that this viewport is their
favourite on the ship. 
GUEST3: I thought it would bring me some comfort. But these are not my
stars. Even the heavens are denied to me here. Synthetic swill. I don't
suppose your food terminals would be capable of producing a Romulan
ale? 
DATA: I am afraid they would require the molecular structure of the
beverage in question. And, as you are no doubt aware, our knowledge of
your planet is quite limited. 
GUEST3: The loss is yours. For I have visited over a hundred different
worlds, and none possessed the awesome beauty of Romulus. 
DATA: Am I correct in assuming you regret your decision to come here? 
GUEST3: What I did had to be done. But to never again see the firefalls
of Gath Gal'thong, and the spires of my home as they rise above the
Apnex Sea at dawn. It's a bitter thing to be exiled from your home. 
DATA: It does appear unlikely you will ever be allowed to return to
your planet. 
GUEST3: The cold reaction of an android. 
DATA: But perhaps we can bring Romulus to you.
