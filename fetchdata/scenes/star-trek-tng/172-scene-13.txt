DATA: Initial scans of ionisation patterns
complete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings. 
PICARD: It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy being
expended. 
DATA: Actually, it is five point three four times ten to the forty
first watts, sir. Well within the norm for this type of phenomena. 
PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, Data, but that takes away none of the
wonder.

[Holding room]

NIBOR: Check. 
RIKER: I'm sick of this game. 
NIBOR: Of course, now that you're losing. 
RIKER: Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up. 
NIBOR: You can't resign now. 
RIKER: It's hard to play from in here. I can't even see the whole
board. 
NIBOR: Ah, then you'll finish the game if I let you out of the cell? 
RIKER: I might. 
NIBOR: Clever, human, but I'm not that foolish. 
RIKER: What, do you think I'm going to try to escape? What would that
get me? You've already got her. Besides, where would I go? 
NIBOR: I do not trust you. 
RIKER: Fine. Thanks for the game. 
NIBOR: Come out here. (puts the forcefield back up) Now save your rook,
if you can.

LWAXANA: And that was my first husband. Not much of
a conversationalist, but what a lover. Well, then I met Zarn 
TOG: I do not want to hear about your other romances. It makes me
jealous. 
LWAXANA: My, my. What big ears you have. Has anyone ever told you how
attractive they are? 
(She strokes the edges) 
TOG: Some females think they are my best feature. No one has ever given
me oo-mox like this before. 
LWAXANA: Oo-mox? 
TOG: There is no translation. But the ear is one of our most erogenous
zones.
