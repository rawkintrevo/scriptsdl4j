[Cargo deck five]

PULASKI: Why this one specimen and none of the
others? Something is stimulating it. Do you have its etiology? Do you
know how it was developed? 
DEALT: Yes, it's right over here. 
PULASKI: It's a mutated strain developed by Doctor Susan Nuress during
an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the Oby System. It
was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests. This particular one
bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth? 
DEALT: It could, but I. I've got something. 
RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? 
DEALT: I don't know. It wasn't here before. 
PULASKI: Well, it is now. What emits that type of radiation? 
DATA: A subspace phase inverter. 
LAFORGE: We don't have one. 
DATA: Certain cyanoacrylates. 
PULASKI: Also not on this ship. What else? Because it's here and we
better find it.

[Troi's quarters]

(It's Ian's bed time) 
IAN: I can feel that some of the people are very worried. 
TROI: Yes. I feel it too, but don't you worry. 
IAN: It's me, Mommy. I'm the reason. 
TROI: What? 
IAN: It's me. 
TROI: You? 
IAN: Yes. I have to leave you now, or it'll be very bad for everyone. 
TROI: What are you saying? 
IAN: I have to leave now. 
TROI: Leave? You are going to die. No, you can't! Sickbay, this is
Counsellor Troi, I need the Doctor in my quarters now! Ian! Ian, no.
Ian. 
(Pulaski arrives with Data and Riker) 
TROI: It's Ian. Hurry. 
PULASKI: What happened? Did he eat anything? Did he fall? 
TROI: No. 
DATA: Commander, the child is the source of the unusual radiation. 
TROI: Ian said he's the reason the ship is in danger. 
DATA: That analysis is correct. 
PULASKI: I'm losing life signs. 
TROI: You must save him. 
PULASKI: I'm sorry. 
(As Troi weeps by the bed, Ian turns into a ball of light which she can
hold in her hands. She calms and smiles, then it flies out into space) 
LAFORGE [OC]: Commander Riker, the containment field has stabilised. 
RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
TROI: Then Ian was right. He was the cause. 
RIKER: Apparently so. 
TROI: He is a life force entity. When we passed each other in space, he
was curious about us, so he decided the best way to learn was to go
through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way
to understand us. He never meant any harm. 
RIKER: There was a moment when you smiled. 
TROI: He said, thank you. I told him we will miss him. And I will.

[Bridge]

(approaching a space station) 
PICARD: Standard station orbit, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir, standard orbit. 
PICARD: Transporter room three, this is the Captain. We have arrived. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Let's make this transfer with all
deliberate speed. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I'll be glad to be relieved of this cargo. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
WESLEY: Captain. Could I see you when you have a moment? 
PICARD: In my Ready room, when your duties permit. 
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. 

[Cargo deck five]

LAFORGE: How long is it going to take to develop a
vaccine? 
DEALT: We may never develop one. 
LAFORGE: All of this might have been in vain? 
DEALT: Let's hope not. 
DATA [OC]: Stand by to energise. 
LAFORGE: Good luck. 
(Dealt is beamed away) 
LAFORGE: Data, you can lock on to the first group and begin
transporting on my mark.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Wesley enters) 
WESLEY: Captain Picard, I've thought about this a lot. I want to remain
on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Have you discussed this with your mother? 
WESLEY: No, sir. Before I do that, I'd like your permission to stay. 
PICARD: Wesley, it's a little more complicated than that. 
WESLEY: Captain, this is where I want to be. This is where I feel I
belong. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, transfer complete. We are ready to leave orbit. 
PICARD: Make it so, Number One. Return to your position.
