[Courtroom]

(The crew find themselves in a room with a noisy
audience. One of the future soldiers that Q pretended to be, fires his
machine gun for silence. An Oriental man takes charge) 
GUEST0: The prisoners will all stand. 
(Picard sits down) 
DATA: Historically intriguing, Captain. Very, very accurate. 
PICARD: Mid twenty first century. The post-atomic horror. 
GUEST0: All present, stand and make respectful attention to honoured
Judge. 
TROI: Careful, sir. This is not an illusion or a dream. 
PICARD: But these courts happened in the past. 
TROI: I don't understand either, but this is real. 
GUEST1: Get to your feet, criminals! 
(From the distance, a spotlight reveals a figure approaching, dressed
in red, and sitting on a throne carried on hydraulics for effect) 
DATA: At least we are acquainted with the judge, Captain. 
(Q gestures the crowd to sit) 
GUEST1: Attention! On your feet. Attention! 
(Tasha disarms him) 
Q: (to soldier) You are out of order. (another soldier kills him) The
prisoners will not be harmed until they are found guilty. Dispose of
that. 
PICARD: Can we assume you mean this will be a fair trial? 
Q: Yes, absolutely equitable. Proceed. 
GUEST0: Before this gracious court now appear these prisoners to
answer for the multiple and grievous savageries of their species. How
plead you, criminal? 
DATA: If I may, Captain? Objection, your honour. In the year 2036, the
new United Nations declared that no Earth citizen
could be made to answer for the crimes of his race or forbears. 
Q (JUDGE): Objection denied. This is a court of the year 2079, by which
time more rapid progress had caused all United
Earth nonsense to be abolished. 
PICARD: Tasha, no. 
TASHA: I must! Because I grew up on a world that allowed things like
this court. And it was people like these that saved me from it. This
so-called court should get down on its knees to what Starfleet is, what
it represents. 
(Q freezes Tasha) 
TROI: You barbarian! This woman 
GUEST0: Criminals keep silence! 
PICARD: You've got a lot to learn about humans if you think you can
torture us or frighten us into silence. Will she live? 
DATA: Uncertain. When he froze Lieutenant Torres on the Bridge, we had
our Sickbay to help thaw him out. 
GUEST0: You will answer the charges, criminals. 
PICARD: Or what? Or this? Her death? Or worse? You promised the
prisoners will not be harmed. We plead nothing so long as you break
your own rules. 
Q: I suggest you centre your attention on this trial, Captain. It may
be your only hope. 
PICARD: I suggest you are now having second thoughts it. You are
considering that if you conduct a fair trial, which was your promise,
you may lose. 
Q: Lose? 
PICARD: Yes, even though you're judge and prosecutor. 
Q: And jury. 
PICARD: Accepted, so long as you keep to your agreement. And assaulting
prisoners is hardly a fair trial. 
Q: This is a merciful court. (Tasha is thawed) Silence! Continuing
these proceedings, I must caution you that legal trickery is not
permitted. This is a court of 
PICARD: court of fact! We humans know our past, even when we're ashamed
of it. I recognise this court system as the one that agreed with that
line from Shakespeare.  Kill all the
lawyers. 
Q: Which was done. 
PICARD: Which led to the rule guilty until proven innocent. 
Q: Of course. Bringing the innocent to trial would be unfair. You will
now answer to the charge of being a grievously savage race. 
PICARD: Grievously savage could mean anything. I will answer only
specific charges. 
Q: Are you certain you want a full disclosure of human ugliness? So be
it, fool! Present the charges. 
GUEST0: Criminal, you will read the charges to the court. 
(Picard takes his time to read the pad that is handed to him, then
gives it back) 
PICARD: I see no charges against us, Your Honour. 
Q: You are out of order! 
(Guns are placed at Data and Troi's heads) 
Q: Soldiers, you will press those triggers if this criminal answers
with any word other than guilty. Criminal, how plead you? 
PICARD: Guilty. Provisionally. 
Q: The Court will hear the provision. 
PICARD: We question whether this court is abiding by its own trial
instructions. Have I have permission to have Commander Data repeat the
record? 
Q: There will be no legal trickery 
PICARD: These will be your own words, your Honour. What exactly what
followed his Honour's statement that the prisoner will not be harmed? 
DATA: Yes, sir. The Captain had asked the question. Can we assume you
mean this will be a fair trial? And in reply the judge stated, yes,
absolutely equitable. 
Q: Irrelevant testimony, entirely irrelevant. 
PICARD: Alright! We agree there is evidence to support the court's
contention that humans have been savage. Therefore I say test us. Test
whether this is presently true of humans. 
Q: I see, I see. And so you petition the Court to accept you and your
comrades as proof of what humanity has become. 
PICARD: There must be many ways we can be tested. We have a long
mission ahead of us. 
Q: Another brilliant suggestion, Captain. But your test hardly requires
a long mission. Your immediate destination offers far more challenge
than you can possibly imagine. Yes, this Farpoint station will be an
excellent test. 
GUEST0: All present, respectfully stand. 
Q: This trial is adjourned, to allow the criminals to be tested. 
GUEST0: This honourable court is adjourned. Stand respectfully. 
Q: Captain, you may find you are not nearly clever enough to deal with
what lies ahead for you. It may have been better to accept sentence
here.
