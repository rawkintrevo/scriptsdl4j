[Battle Bridge]

(Families of various races make their way along
corridors as the bridge crew settle into a more compact Bridge) 
PICARD: Lieutenant, your torpedoes must detonate close enough to the
hostile to blind it at the moment we separate. 
TASHA: Understood, sir. 
TROI: All decks acknowledging, sir. 
PICARD: Worf, this is the Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: At the moment of separation, we will
reverse power just enough to get your saucer section out ahead and
clear of us. 
WORF: Understood, Captain. 
[Battle Bridge]

TASHA: Torpedoes away, sir. 
(Eight red dots shoot out from the stern) 
PICARD: Begin countdown. Mark. 
DATA: Starship separation in six, five, four, three, two, one. 
(Gracefully, the huge saucer lifts away from the body of the ship) 
DATA: Separation is successful, sir. 
(The main body does a hand-brake turn and heads back to their pursuer.
The torpedoes detonate.) 
TASHA: Torpedoes have detonated, sir. 
PICARD: Let's come to a stop. Reverse power. 
DATA: Reverse power. Decelerating. 
PICARD: Dead stop. We'll hold this position and wait for them. 
TROI: That will bring them here in just minutes, sir. 
TASHA: Will we make a fight of it, Captain? If we can at least damage
their ship we'll have a chance 
PICARD: Lieutenant, are you recommending we fight a life form that can
do all those things? I'd like to hear your advice. 
TASHA: I spoke before I thought, sir. We should look for some way to
distract them from going after the saucer. 
O'BRIEN: All forward motion stopped, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, conn. Commander, signal the following in all
languages and on all frequencies. We surrender. State that we are not
asking for any terms or conditions. 
TROI: Aye, sir. All language forms and frequencies. 
(The ball reaches them and surrounds them with it's barrier. The ship
shakes)
