[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Engines now. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, go to warp. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Status? 
ALLENBY: Unchanged. We have not broken free of the graviton field. 
DATA: Integrity-field pressure has increased by two hundred seventeen
percent, Captain. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Differential stress will exceed upper limit in
fifteen seconds. 
PICARD: Disengage all engines. 
[Engineering]

COMPUTER: Warning. Differential stress will exceed
upper 
LAFORGE: Engines disengaged, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Report, La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: The energy we wanted to transfer to the nacelles

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Was absorbed by the graviton wake instead.
It set up a torsional wave that rebounded back to the ship. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: We're lucky the hull is still in one
piece. 
PICARD: This little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination. 
DATA: Sir, during our attempt to break away, I recorded a momentary
alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster. 
RIKER: You think we got their attention, Data? 
DATA: Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediately
returned to its previous dynamic. 
PICARD: Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into the
Universal Translator. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt at
communication.

GUINAN: (sneaking up from behind) More tea? I
didn't mean to startle you. 
TROI: That's alright. I'm getting used to it. 
GUINAN: May I? 
TROI: Sure. 
(Guinan sits with her) 
GUINAN: Are you really getting used to it? 
TROI: No. 
GUINAN: Do you want to talk about it? 
TROI: No. 
GUINAN: Good. I get so tired of people coming in with their problems.
They come in, they want a shoulder to cry on, and generally it turns
out to be mine. 
TROI: You'd make a good counsellor. 
GUINAN: I think so too. So I'm going to talk to Picard about it. 
TROI: About what? You becoming counsellor? 
GUINAN: Well, yes, you're leaving. That means there won't be a
counsellor on board, and I suppose I'm going to have a very long line
at that bar. It would be nice to have a nice office, too. 
TROI: It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takes
an enormous commitment. 
GUINAN: I can do that. 
TROI: Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want to
reveal. As ship's counsellor, you have to get them to talk about things
they don't want to reveal. 
GUINAN: I could do that too. 
TROI: What are you? You don't really want to be ship's counsellor. 
GUINAN: What would make you say that? 
TROI: I just know you're not serious. 
GUINAN: Have I given you any indication that I might not serious? 
TROI: Not really, but 
GUINAN: Then how do you know? Are your empathic abilities coming back? 
TROI: No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying to
make me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition,
instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience.
It's not that easy. 
GUINAN: No one said it was easy. It's much harder than you think. Human
intuition and instinct are not always right, but they do make life
interesting. 
TROI: So I'm discovering. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Problem, Data? 
DATA: Yes, Commander. Sensors are detecting highly accelerated
interstellar gases. 
RIKER: Suggesting? 
DATA: Uncertain, sir. The phenomenon is within visual range. 
RIKER: On screen. (it's a vague purple thing) Magnify. 
DATA: It appears to be a cosmic string fragment. Only one hundred seven
kilometres long. 
ALLENBY: A cosmic string? 
RIKER: No wider than a proton but with gravitational fields as powerful
as a black hole. 
DATA: The two-dimensional beings seem to be caught in the gravitational
pull of the string. Their course is taking them directly toward it. 
RIKER: And us right along with them.

Captain's log, stardate 44359.5. What began as a
curious inconvenience has turned into a serious threat. At current
speed, the two-dimensional beings and the Enterprise will be drawn into
the cosmic string fragment in seven hours.
