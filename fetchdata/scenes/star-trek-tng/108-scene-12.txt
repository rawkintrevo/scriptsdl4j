(Beverly tiptoes to Geordi's station) 
CRUSHER: This is the helm. 
LAFORGE: Unless there have been some changes I don't know about. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher? 
CRUSHER: You will wish to know Lieutenant Worf is much improved. Ready
to return to duty. 
PICARD: What was the diagnosis? 
CRUSHER: A temporary mental aberration. 
PICARD: Doctor, when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, I
expect a better explanation. 
CRUSHER: Then I will first have to run some crosschecks on the library
computer. Klingons are so unusual in their reactions, aren't they? 
PICARD: Use Science Station two, Doctor. 
(That's next to where Data is working) 
DATA: Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do with
medical crosschecks? 
(Unseen by him, the blue energy leaves Beverly and enters the computer.
She is disoriented) 
CRUSHER: Why am I? 
DATA: Is something wrong, Doctor? 
PICARD: Doctor, are you all right? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Yes. I'll do my work in my office. That's where I should
be. 
PICARD: Do you want someone to accompany you? 
(Beverly shakes her head and enters the turbolift) 
DATA: Captain? There is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bring
any information up on it. Science two does not function either, sir. 
SINGH [OC]: Engineering to Captain Picard. 
[Engineering]

SINGH: We have something wrong with warp drive
circuitry, sir. 
[Bridge]

CHIEF [OC]: Transporter room six to Bridge.
Reporting transporter console malfunction, sir. 
PICARD: Data, this ship is less than a year out of Spacedock. What are
the chances of this occurring? 
DATA: It is a virtual impossibility, sir. 
PICARD: So what the hell is going on here?
