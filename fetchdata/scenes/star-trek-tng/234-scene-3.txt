[Deadwood, main street]

(a woman in a state of extreme undress whistles at
Worf from a balcony) 
WORF: You wrote this holodeck programme yourself? 
ALEXANDER: Well, Mister Barclay helped a little. 
WORF: I must have a little talk with Mister Barclay. 
(the sound of a gunshot) 

[Gold Strike saloon]

(the piano player is doing his best, the poker
players are ignoring it, and someone is shooting up a wanted poster of
Eli Hollander) 
GUEST6: If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever
put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? 
(the Mexican laughs) 
GUEST6: Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in
your mouth. 
GUEST3: You're a very funny man, Senor Eli. 
(Worf and Alexander enter) 
ALEXANDER: That's the bad guy. His name's Eli Hollander. They call him
the Butcher of Bozeman. He's killed twenty three men. He's the meanest
and the toughest gunslinger in the West. You have to watch him. He's
fast. 
WORF: So I am here to apprehend him? 
ALEXANDER: If you can. 
WORF: You are under arrest. 
GUEST6: Is that so. 
(Worf punches him in the face) 
WORF: You will come with me. 
ALEXANDER: No, no, no. Computer, freeze programme. 
WORF: What is wrong? 
ALEXANDER: That was too easy. It has to be harder to beat the bad guys.
Otherwise, it's no fun. Computer, increase
programme difficulty to level four. Go back to where my father and I
first walked into the saloon. Come on, Father. 
(Alexander and Worf leave) 
GUEST6: If I ever find the varmint who drew this, he'll be sorry he ever
put pen to paper. I'm ten times uglier than that, ain't I? 
(the Mexican laughs) 
GUEST6: Shut up. You laugh so much, it's a wonder you ain't got flies in
your mouth. 
GUEST3: You're a very funny man, Senor Eli. 
(Worf and Alexander enter. This time the piano player stops, and the
poker players get up and leave) 
WORF: Where are they going? 
ALEXANDER: They don't want to get hit by the bullets. 
WORF: You are under arrest. 
GUEST6: Well, looks like Sheriff Worf's here to arrest me. That don't
sound like a bright idea. 
(Eli has gone to the bar, the Mexican is over on Worf's left) 
GUEST6: Do it? 
WORF: You have been accused of committing a homicide. 
GUEST6: If you mean murder, then I guess I'm guilty. I've killed twenty
three men, Sheriff. One more ain't
going to make much of a difference. Of course, shooting someone as ugly
as you couldn't be considered a crime, could it? Was you just born that
way, or did your momma marry an armadillo? 
(a man behind Worf picks up a chair) 
ALEXANDER: Sheriff, look out! 
(Worf is hit by the chair, but just turns and thumps his attacker. Then
he punches out the Mexican.) 
WORF: I'm beginning to see the appeal of this programme. 
GUEST6: Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff, unless you want a shave. (his gun
is drawn) Okay, boys. Saddle up. But first, get their money and
jewellry. 
WORF: You are a murderer and a thief. 
GUEST6: A man's got to make a living. 
(Eli's hat it blown off by a gunshot from the doorway) 
TROI: I suggest you find a new line of work. 
ALEXANDER: I asked Counsellor Troi to join us. She loves Western
stories. 
GUEST6: You'll regret this, stranger. 
(Eli twirls his pistol back and forth before holstering it.)
