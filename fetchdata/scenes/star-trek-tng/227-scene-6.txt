TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER CARMICHAEL [OC] CRUSHER DATA CARMICHAEL
ophidian phaser shot lass carrying thorough gentlemen street whistles

[Infirmary street]

(as the team come onto the street, a carriage
careers around the corner) 
RIKER: Data! 
(they climb on) 
LAFORGE: Boy, are we glad to see you. 
DATA: I suggest we postpone our greetings for another occasion. 
PICARD: Agreed. Get us out of here. 
(the cops come running, blowing their whistles)

[Rented room]

LAFORGE: If we tune a phaser to the approximate
frequency of triolic waves and lay down a field burst, it might
respond. 
(the phaser shot turns the cane head into a writhing snake's head) 
TROI: The ophidian the aliens were carrying. 
(it sends off energy charges before reverting to the cane) 
RIKER: What the? 
LAFORGE: These look like minute distortions in the space-time
continuum, like the one we saw on Devidia Two. 
RIKER: They were so small, and they lasted only a second. 
DATA: The aliens appear to be able to concentrate the distortion and
direct it to a specific time and place. 
CRUSHER: Maybe they have something, a mechanism that focuses it. 
LAFORGE: Any device like that would produce significant levels of
triolic waves. Like the ones in the cavern where Data's head was found.

DATA: I have located that cavern. 
(knocking on the door and frantic activity) 
CARMICHAEL [OC]: Mister Pikerd! I know you're in there. Open the door! 
TROI: Mrs. Carmichael. 
DATA: How now, spirit. Whither wander you? 
CRUSHER: Over hill, over dale, thorough bush, thorough brier, 
TROI: Mrs. Carmichael, thank goodness you're here. 
PICARD: We need someone to read a part. You're just in time. 
CARMICHAEL: Mister Picard, I need to be talking to you. 
CRUSHER: My mistress would that he be gone. 
RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 
PICARD: Now, Mrs. Carmichael Right there. 
RIKER: Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania. 
CARMICHAEL: What, jealous Oberon. Fairies skip hence. I have foresworn
his bed and company. 
PICARD: Well, I don't think I need to hear any more. That was truly
unique. 
CARMICHAEL: Really? 
PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have found our Titania. Don't
you agree? 
(a round of applause) 
CARMICHAEL: Well, I did do a church play when I was a lass. 
PICARD: Well, there you are. We start rehearsals tomorrow. 
(Picard kisses her on both cheeks, and she turns into a simpering girl)
