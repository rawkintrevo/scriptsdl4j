 LWAXANA TOG PICARD

[Tog's quarters]

declaiming goes on in the background) 
TOG: You didn't tell me that you and Captain Picard were 
LWAXANA: You said you didn't want to hear about my other romances. I
have a new love, Jean-Luc. 
[Bridge]


LWAXANA
[on viewscreen]: And you can't keep killing
all my lovers. That simply has to stop. 
TOG [on viewscreen]: Killing? 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: Oh, he's insanely jealous. 
PICARD: Listen, Tog, I must possesses Lwaxana. And if that means
destroying your ship in the process, so be it. 
TOG [on viewscreen]: Captain, I had no idea Lwaxana was 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: Don't let him threaten you. You can defeat
him. The only way you'll ever get me back is over Tog's dead body! 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: That can be arranged. Mister Worf, arm phaser
banks and photon torpedoes. If Lwaxana Troi is not in my arms in ten

TOG [on viewscreen]: But you will destroy Lwaxana! 
PICARD: When I have plucked the rose, I cannot give it vital growth

(Lwaxana appears, and sits on Picard's knee) 
LWAXANA: You wonderfully jealous fool, you. 
TOG [on viewscreen]: Captain, I trust there will be no further action
taken against us? 
PICARD: Such as my reporting this incident to your superiors who may
question your competency as
DaiMon? I will think about it. Screen off. 
LWAXANA: Thank you, Jean-Luc. You were most convincing. You certainly
convinced me. 
PICARD: I am truly grateful, Mrs. Troi, that you risked your life to
save my people. I'll have you home within a few hours. 
LWAXANA: Oh, no, no, no, no, that won't be necessary. I'd just love to
hear more of your poetry. 
PICARD: Perhaps another time. (finally manages to stand up. Please.
Mister Crusher, set course for Betazed. Warp nine.
