(Maylor is laid out) 
PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor?
CRUSHER: Yes, Captain. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a little
concerned. I haven't been able to determine the cause of death. She was
elderly. and Alkar said she had been ill, but I found no evidence of
any disease. I did find abnormally high levels of neurotransmitter
residue in her cerebral cortex.
PICARD: What are you suggesting?
CRUSHER: I'd like to do an autopsy. I've already spoken to Alkar, and
he informs me that Lumerian custom forbids it. Could you speak with him?
PICARD: Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to the
Enterprise?
CRUSHER: Well, no.
PICARD: Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes.

herself in the mirror, and starts caressing herself) 
[Alkar's quarters]

ALKAR: Deanna.
TROI: Hello.
ALKAR: Come in, please.
TROI: I thought you might like some company, if you're not too busy.
ALKAR: Nothing that can't wait. Would you like something to drink?
TROI: No. I'd like you to talk to me.
ALKAR: About?
TROI: About you. I don't know anything about you. And I'd like to.
ALKAR: There's not much to know. I lead a very simple life.
TROI: What kind of woman do you find attractive? Do you find me
attractive?
ALKAR: Extremely.
TROI: And when you find someone attractive, what do you usually do?
ALKAR: That depends on a lot of things.
TROI: Is it really so complicated?
ALKAR: It can be.
TROI: Well, perhaps you over think things.
(she's getting very seductive) 
ALKAR: Deanna.
TROI: Yes? 
ALKAR: I'm sorry. If I led you to believe? You are very beautiful, but
our relationship can't be like that.
