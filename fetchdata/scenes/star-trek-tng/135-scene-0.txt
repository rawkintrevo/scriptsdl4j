[Data's quarters]

(Pulaski, La Forge, Data (wearing a dealer's shade)
O'Brien and Riker are sitting down for an evening's entertainment) 
O'BRIEN: Hold it, that's my chair. My luck is always lousy unless I
start on the dealer's right. 
DATA: That would seem to be superstition. 
O'BRIEN: Bitter experience has taught me it's a fundamental truth. 
RIKER: Okay, the game is five card stud, nothing wild. Ante up. 
DATA: This game is exceedingly simple. With only fifty two cards,
twenty one of which I will see, and four other players, there are a
limited number of winning combinations. 
LAFORGE: There's more to this than just the cards, Data. 
DATA: Of course. The bets will indicate of the relative strength of
each hand. 
O'BRIEN: Time to pluck a pigeon. 
(Kate starts the betting) 
PULASKI: Five. 
LAFORGE: I'm in. 
DATA: I too. 
RIKER: Call. 
(The first lot of face up cards are dealt) 
RIKER: A seven, and a six, and the ace. 
DATA: I bet ten. 
O'BRIEN: See that. 
RIKER: Call. 
PULASKI: Fold. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, me too. I'm out. 
(Another deal. Riker is showing the ten, Jack and five of hearts. Data
has two Queens and an Ace) 
DATA: I bet five. 
O'BRIEN: Same.
RIKER: Your five. And five. 
(Data sees the bet) 
O'BRIEN: Too rich for me. 
(Final card) 
RIKER: No help. 
(He gives himself the four of hearts. Ooo's all round) 
DATA: I bet ten. 
RIKER: Your ten and ten. 
(We discover that Data has a third Queen. He looks at Riker) 
DATA: Is that what is known as a poker face? 
RIKER: Are you playing or not? 
DATA: I fold. 
(Riker's hole card was the two of spades. Busted) 
DATA: You had nothing! 
LAFORGE: He bluffed you, Data. 
DATA: It makes very little sense to bet when you cannot win. 
RIKER: But I did win. I was betting that you wouldn't call. 
DATA: How could you tell? 
PULASKI: Instinct, Data, instinct. The game is seven card high/low with
a buy on the last card. And just to make it more interesting, the man
with the axe takes all.
