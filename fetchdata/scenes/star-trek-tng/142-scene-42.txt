[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: O'Brien here, Captain.
PICARD: If your lock on the away team wavers in the slightest, beam
them back immediately.
O'BRIEN: Count on it, sir.

[Borg ship]

(They have reached a different part of the ship.
There are baby noises, and incubator units maintained by a lot of
machinery) 
RIKER: Captain this is incredible. We've entered what appears to be the
Borg nursery.
PICARD [OC]: Describe it.
RIKER: From the look of it the Borg are born as biological life form.
It seems that almost immediately after birth they begin artificial
implants. Apparently the Borg have developed the technology 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: To link artificial intelligence
directly into the humanoid brain. 
[Borg ship]

RIKER: Astounding. 
DATA: Commander?
RIKER: What is it?
DATA: The ship appears to be regenerating. Perhaps this explains why
they have not taken notice of our presence. Their collective effort is
being directed into repairing this vessel.
RIKER: Captain, 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: The Borg seem to be using their
combined power to repair the ship.
PICARD: Transporter Chief, beam the away team directly to the Bridge. 
(O'Brien does so) 
PICARD: Let's get the hell out of here. Warp eight. Now, Mister
Crusher. Engage.
DATA: Captain, the Borg are in pursuit.
PICARD: On screen. Magnify.
RIKER: Increase to ten to the third power. 
(They see bent metal straightening) 
RIKER: It's continuing to regenerate.
PICARD: Let's see if we can outrun them. Lieutenant La Forge, I want
maximum warp 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: For as long as we can hold it. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. We are passing warp eight point five.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Eight point eight. Warp nine.
RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes. See if we can slow them down.
WORF: Torpedoes armed.
PICARD: Fire.
(Two nice big fireballs on the cube) 
WORF: They had no effect.
LAFORGE [OC]: Bridge, this is Engineering. We are now at warp nine
point six five. 
WORF: The Borg are still gaining.
Q: They will follow this ship until you exhaust your fuel. They will
wear down your defences. Then you will be theirs. Admit it, Picard.
You're out of your league. You should have stayed where you belonged.

Captain's log supplemental. We are unable to
maintain the gap between the Enterprise and the Borg ship.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. 
PICARD: Go ahead.
LAFORGE [OC]: You've got all we can give you. 
PICARD: I understand, Mister La Forge.
WORF: Captain, the enemy vessel is firing on us. There are no reports
of any damage to the Enterprise.
DATA: Captain, the target was not the ship. The weapon was designed to
drain the shields.
WORF: Confirmed. Shield effectiveness has been reduced twelve percent.
WESLEY: Captain, the Borg ship is closing.
WORF: They're firing again. Shields have been reduced forty one
percent. Another hit and we will be defenceless.
RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes.
WORF: Torpedoes armed.
PICARD: Fire the photons.
WORF: The Borg ship was not damaged.
Q: You can't outrun them. You can't destroy them. If you damage them,
the essence of what they are remains. They regenerate and keep coming.
Eventually you will weaken, your reserves will be gone. They are
relentless.
WORF: The Borg ship is firing. We have lost shields again.
