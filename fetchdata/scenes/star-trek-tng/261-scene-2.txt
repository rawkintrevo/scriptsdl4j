HANSEN DATA LAFORGE COMPUTER

[Engineering]

(La Forge is doing something with a device to the
dilithium crystals) 
DATA: Geordi, there has been a slight drop in sensor efficiency.
Perhaps we should examine the phase buffers. 
LAFORGE: No problem, Data. I'll be right with you. Okay, Hansen,
transfer EPS conduit thirteen to the stabiliser matrix. 
HANSEN: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Is there a problem with the engines? 
LAFORGE: No. 
DATA: Then why are you stabilizing the EPS conduit? 
LAFORGE: I'm just trying to get a slightly higher power conversion
level. 
DATA: But that would not affect the engines in any way. 
LAFORGE: I know that, Data. It's not the point. 
DATA: What is the point? 
LAFORGE: I'm just trying to get a higher conversion level, that's all. 
DATA: Why? 
LAFORGE: You know the Intrepid? 
DATA: Yes. 
LAFORGE: Well, their Chief Engineer is Commander Donald Kaplan. He and
I went through the Academy together. I just like to make sure that our
power conversion levels are a little higher than theirs. 
DATA: I understand. You are in competition with Mister Kaplan. 
LAFORGE: You might say that. This is the flagship. We should be better
than everybody else. 
DATA: Then you are trying to outperform the Intrepid. 
LAFORGE: Actually it's more a point of personal pride. These are my
engines. And there's nothing wrong with a little friendly rivalry.
Okay. Computer, how much have the conversion levels increased? 
COMPUTER: Levels are unchanged. 
LAFORGE: All right, I'll deal with of this later. Let me give you a
hand with those sensors.
