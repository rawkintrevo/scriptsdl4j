TROI PICARD LWAXANA COMPUTER MADELINE SLADE MAN

[Hill's outer office]

MADELINE: Hi, Dix. 
PICARD: Madeline. Good to see you again. 
MADELINE: You're too much, Dix. You make it sound like you ain't seen
me in a year. You got two calls. They're on your desk. 
PICARD: New cases? 
MADELINE: Are you kidding? The last time we had a new case, Hitler and
Stalin were
bosom buddies. The landlord came by. He wants the geetas or he wants
you out. 
PICARD: The geetas? 
MADELINE: The moolah, Dix. The rent. And since we're on the subject,
it's been a month since I seen anything. Now I know it's been
tough, since you got out of the hospital, but I got responsibilities. 
PICARD: Then I suppose I had better get a case. 
MADELINE: It wouldn't hurt. 
[Hill's office]

(Picard takes off his coat and hat, turns on the
radio and looks around. The song is 'Let's Get Away From It All, sung
by a group that sounds like the Beverly Sisters. He sits down, puts his
feet up on the desk and relaxes)

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: Unavailable? Ship's business? You mean
ship's business takes precedence over me? 
TROI: I'm afraid so, Mother. 
LWAXANA: Oh, well, he was too old for me anyway. Homn, perhaps we
should consider my alternate plan. 
TROI: Alternate plan? 
LWAXANA: You worry too much, Little One. Your mother has the situation
well in hand.

[Hill's office]

MADELINE: There's a gentleman here to see you,
Mister Hill. And he doesn't look like a client. 
SLADE: Hill? The name is Slade Bender. 
PICARD: Excuse me. (turns off the radio) What can I do for you, Mister
Bender? 
SLADE: It's about Alva. 
PICARD: You'll have to be a little more precise. 
SLADE: Okay, you want to play stupid? That's jake with me. A week ago a
man came in here. He wanted you to find his girlfriend. Name's Alva. 
PICARD: Did I find her? 
SLADE: You know, you're getting on my nerves. You found her, all right.
Face down in the river. 
PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. 
SLADE: Yeah, yeah, we're all broken up about it. Especially the
boyfriend, who's been
indicted for murder. 
PICARD: And what are you here to do? Ask for a refund? 
SLADE: Nah, I'm here to kill you! 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, this isn't what I wanted
at all. It's much to violent. I'm here to relax, not to dodge bullets.
Reconfigure. 
COMPUTER: Please define. 
PICARD: More ambience. Less substance. 
COMPUTER: Do you wish to leave the holodeck and re-enter, or continue
from this point?

PICARD: I will continue. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. You may continue. 
MADELINE: There's a gentleman here to see you, Mister Hill. 
PICARD: Thank you, Madeline. 
MAN: You a private dick? 
PICARD: That's what it says on my door. 
MAN: Is that supposed to be funny? 'Cos if it is, you gotta know that I
ain't in the mood for funny. Now, I came here on serious business.
There's a job I want you to do for me. 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Clear. Computer, this still isn't
right. One kind of violence is being substituted for another.
Reconfigure. 
COMPUTER: You may continue. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
(Slade bursts in with a machine gun) 
SLADE: You're through ducking me, Hill! 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme! Variations on a theme. Computer,
perhaps I am not clearly defining my intent. 
COMPUTER: The flexibility of the programme is limited to the parameters
of the Dixon Hill novels. 
PICARD: Yes. Of course.
