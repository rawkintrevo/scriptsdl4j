[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Approaching Earth, sir. 
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Standard orbit, sir. 
PICARD: Any word from Starfleet Command, Data? 
DATA: Nothing so far, sir. 
PICARD: Strange. 
(Enterprise glides over the moon on final approach) 
DATA: Captain. I am now receiving a message from Starfleet Command. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(A trio of elderly Admirals are seated behind a desk. Two humans
flanking a Vulcan) 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: Greetings Enterprise. I am Admiral Savar. This
is Admiral Aaron, and I believe you already know Admiral Quinn. 
PICARD: Yes, indeed. It's good to see you again, Admiral. 
QUINN [on viewscreen]: And you, Captain. 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: Of course. We are always delighted when the
Enterprise returns to the nest. Yet we are puzzled by the timing of
your visit. 
PICARD: Yes, sir. I can imagine you would be. 
AARON [on viewscreen]: Governor Delaplane of Pacifica informs us that
you cancelled your scheduled stop there. Is this true? 
PICARD: Yes, sir, it is. 
AARON [on viewscreen]: Explain yourself, Captain. Why have you returned
to Earth? 
PICARD: I would rather discuss in person, Admiral. 
(Dexter Remmick appears and whispers to Savar) 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: Excuse us for one moment, Captain. 
RIKER: They seem normal enough. 
PICARD: On the surface. Counsellor, any thoughts? 
TROI: Hard to say. Someone is hiding something, but I can't tell who or
what. 
RIKER: I must say I'm not overjoyed to see Remmick again. 
LAFORGE: Considering what we've done, their response has been pretty
temperate. 
WORF: I don't like it. You can't trust them. 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: Forgive the delay, Captain Picard. We'd be
delighted if you and your First Officer would join us for dinner. 
AARON [on viewscreen]: Yes. Delighted. 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: It would give you a good opportunity to
expatiate your viewpoint. 
AARON [on viewscreen]: To elaborate upon whatever it is that's
troubling you. 
PICARD: Thank you. We accept your gracious offer. 
SAVAR [on viewscreen]: Excellent. Preparations are already underway. 
AARON [on viewscreen]: We'll greet you in the reception area in, say,
twenty minutes? 
PICARD: Splendid. 
QUINN [on viewscreen]: I won't be able to attend dinner, I'm afraid,
but I would like to see the ship and say hello again, Captain. 
PICARD: Of course. We look forward to seeing you, Admiral. Enterprise
out. Quinn wants to see us alone. At least we know he's still on our
side. Mister Data, you have the Bridge. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Starfleet Transporter room]

(Quinn has a case with him, that contains a living
creature similar to the Tau Ceti thing from Wrath of
Khan) 
REMMICK: Are you ready to beam up to the Enterprise, sir? 
QUINN: Yes, Commander, quite ready. Energise, Mister Remmick. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD: Welcome aboard, Greg. 
QUINN: Good to see you. 
PICARD: You remember Commander Riker. 
QUINN: Hello again, Commander. 
PICARD: I must say, you're looking remarkably well. 
QUINN: Never felt better in my life. 
PICARD: When you were here last, you were saying that you were feeling
tired. 
QUINN: Tired of life I was, but not anymore. I'm ready for new
challenges now. What about another look at this ship?
