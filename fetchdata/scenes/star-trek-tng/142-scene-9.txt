RIKER: Guinan? I don't remember you ever calling
the Bridge before.
GUINAN [OC]: Is everything alright?
RIKER: How do you mean?
GUINAN [OC]: Is there anything unusual happening?
RIKER: No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask?

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: I'm not sure. It's just a feeling. I've had
it a couple of times before. It's probably nothing. Forget that I
called. Ten Forward out.

Q: The locator beacon won't help. They'll never
think to look for you this far away.
PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Stop this foolishness, Q. Return me
to the Enterprise.
Q: I suggest you change your attitude. Petulance does not become you.
We have business, Picard.
PICARD: Keeping me a prisoner here will not compel me to discuss
anything with you.
Q: It will in time.

[Ten forward]

SONYA: I appreciate your advice, Lieutenant. And,
I'll take it to heart.
LAFORGE: Guinan?
GUINAN: Can I get you something?
LAFORGE: We're fine. Is everything all right?
GUINAN: I don't know.
LAFORGE: I think I'll go check out Engineering.
SONYA: I'll go with you.

TROI: Where's the Captain?
RIKER: In his quarters? 
TROI: Captain, this is Counsellor Troi.
RIKER: Computer locate Captain Picard.
COMPUTER: The Captain is not on the ship.
WORF: Commander, there is a shuttle missing from bay two.
RIKER: All stop.
WESLEY: Answering all stop, sir.
WORF: I have hailed the shuttle on all frequencies. No response.
DATA: Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector.
RIKER: We think we can assume the Captain is aboard that shuttle.
WESLEY: How could he get to the shuttlebay and leave the Enterprise
without us knowing?
That's not possible.
RIKER: Take it easy, Wes. We're going to find him. I want to begin a
methodical search. Worf, set sensors on maximum scan. Data, use our
present location as a centre. Plot a search pattern from these
coordinates to cover the most area in the least time.
DATA: Search pattern has been input, sir.
RIKER: Engage, Mister Crusher.

First officer's log, stardate 42761.3. We have not
been able to determine why, or how, Captain Picard left the Enterprise.
We can't even be certain he is in the missing shuttle, although that is
the assumption on which we are
proceeding. For the last six hours, we have been searching without
success.
