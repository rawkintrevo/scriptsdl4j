(Geordi has normal eyes and no visor) 
RIKER [OC]: Geordi, have you found it yet? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. I'm starting to get some fumes. Ammonia, chlorine,
potassium chloride. 
(Geordi climbs up into the fumes to the next level) 
LAFORGE: I can feel the heat from here. 
(he crawls along an access tunnel) 
LAFORGE: There it is. 
RIKER [OC]: How far? 
LAFORGE: About ten metres up the ODN line. Boy, it's hot. I'd say over
two thousand degrees. I'm going in. 
(Geordi reaches through the flames to pull levers) 
LAFORGE: We're okay. I've activated the emergency suppression system.

[Laboratory]

(Geordi is the contraption used in Offspring and
Best of Both Worlds, wearing a virtual reality suit) 
CRUSHER: All his vital functions are completely normal. 
DATA: The interface unit is operating within expected parameters. 
RIKER: Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses? 
CRUSHER: Psychosomatic response. 
LAFORGE: (no visor, white eyes) I feel like I'm actually here. I mean
there, in the Jefferies tube. It's funny. When I saw the smoke, I
couldn't help but cough. 
DATA: No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience. 
CRUSHER: The interface is perfect for Geordi because his visor inputs
allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral
cortex. 
RIKER: It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get the
probe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach
Marijne Seven. 
LAFORGE: Will do. Wait a minute.
