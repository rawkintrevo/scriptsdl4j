WORF: The forcefield will have to drop below two
point seven before we can beam them up.

(Picard is brought back from the shuttlecraft) 
ARMUS: Satisfied? 
PICARD: Yes. 
ARMUS: Then can we leave? 
PICARD: Where do you want to go? Do you want to try to find those who
left you here? 
ARMUS: She told you about them. 
PICARD: How long have you been here? 
ARMUS: Since they left. A very long time. 
PICARD: A long time to be alone. 
ARMUS: Save your compassion. It's revolting. You offer it like a prize
when in fact it's an insult. 
PICARD: Because you feel unworthy. 
ARMUS: You overrate your gift. You humans are puny, weak. 
PICARD: But our spirit, it is indomitable. 
ARMUS: And still you die from a flake of my power. 
PICARD: A great poet once said, 'all spirits are enslaved that serve
things evil'. 
ARMUS: You do not understand. I do not serve things evil. I am evil. 
PICARD: Oh, no, you are not. 
ARMUS: I am a skin of evil left here by a race of Titans who believed
if they rid themselves of me, they would free the bonds of
destructiveness. 
PICARD: Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumed
by your own pain. Believing your own lies. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Set the computer. When the energy level
reaches two point six point two zero five, automatically beam up Troi
and Prieto. We'll do a parallel transport on the Captain. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
[Planet surface]

PICARD: You say you are true evil? Shall I tell you
what true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender our
freedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. 
ARMUS: I will kill you, and those in there. 
PICARD: But you will still be here. In this place. For ever. Alone.
Immortal. 
[Bridge]

COMPUTER: (male) Stand by for parallel transport. 
WORF: The energy level has dropped to two point six point three. 
[Planet surface]

PICARD: That's your real fear. Never to die. Never
again to be united with those who left you here. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Energy field is two point six. Computer
beginning transport.
