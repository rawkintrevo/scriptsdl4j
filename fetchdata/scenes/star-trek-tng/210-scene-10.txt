TROI WORF ALEXANDER

[Worf's quarters]

WORF: A Klingon's honour is more important to him
than his life. A Klingon would gladly face the most horrible punishment
rather than bring shame or disgrace to his family name. His word is his
bond. Without it, he is nothing. Do you understand? 
(a tiny nod) 
WORF: Why did you lie to me? 
ALEXANDER: I don't know. 
WORF: Did you fear the punishment you would receive? 
ALEXANDER: I don't know. 
WORF: You don't know why you lied, and yet you did. You don't know why
you stole, and yet you did! Alexander, come here. When I was a child,
younger than you, I lost my parents, my family, my people. Everything I
had was taken from me except my sense of honour. It was the one thing I
had which was truly Klingon and which no one could take away. Do you
know who they are?

ALEXANDER: Kahless? 
WORF: And his brother, Morath. They fought for twelve days and twelve
nights because Morath had broken his word and brought
shame to his family. When you lie or steal, you not only dishonour
yourself, but your family. You dishonour me. 
ALEXANDER: I'm sorry, Father. I won't do it ever again. I promise. 
WORF: I accept your word. We will not speak of this matter again.

[Corridor]

TROI: Worf. 
WORF: Counsellor? 
TROI: I just wanted to know how the field trip went yesterday. 
WORF: You have not heard? 
TROI: No. Why?
