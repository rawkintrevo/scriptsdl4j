[Data's quarters]

DATA: Counsellor Troi, what is it? 
(Troi does not speak with her own voice, but sounds more like a Bynar) 
TROI: The plan has failed. 
DATA: You have returned. 
TROI: Your ship is again in our space. 
DATA: I was unable to prevent it. 
TROI: Nevertheless, you are here. 
DATA: The Enterprise is not a threat to you. Give me more time. Our
destruction would only 
(Geordi enters) 
LAFORGE: Data, Captain wanted me to bring you to the Bridge.
Counsellor. 
DATA: One moment, if you would. 
(Geordi leaves) 
DATA: Do nothing. It may yet be possible to salvage the situation.

[Bridge]

DATA: Reporting as ordered, Captain. 
PICARD: Well, Data, as you can see, we're back where it all started. 
DATA: We must leave immediately, sir. 
PICARD: Why? 
DATA: Any further delay would put us all at grave risk. 
PICARD: Why? What is the source of that risk? The energy field? 
DATA: I cannot say. 
PICARD: Data, you sound as if you're stuck in a feedback loop. You
certainly can say. You have free will, you have a choice. 
DATA: My silence is not by choice, sir. 
PICARD: Not by choice? Are you somehow being controlled by that force?
Did Geordi miss something when he examined you? 
DATA: Geordi's examination was exemplary. 
PICARD: Then why are you compelled to disobey my orders? How? During
the missing day, were you contacted by Starfleet? Did they order you to
conceal the truth from us? 
DATA: I cannot answer that. We must leave, sir. 
PICARD: This ship isn't going anywhere. Not until I get an answer. Now
who gave you that order? 
(the possessed Troi enters) 
DATA: You did, sir. 
PICARD: I ordered you to lie? 
WORF: Captain, the energy field is approaching. 
RIKER: Maintain shields at full intensity. 
DATA: No. We must vary shield shape and strength as rapidly as
possible. Maximum shields will only speed the ship's takeover. 
WORF: Contact imminent. 
PICARD: Do as Data says. At once. 
WORF: Aye, sir. The field is shifting amplitude, trying to match the
shields. 
DATA: The energy field will eventually penetrate our shields. There is
no way to counter the Paxans' technology. We can delay their takeover
but we cannot prevent it. 
PICARD: The Paxans. Who are they? 
TROI: You have invaded our system. 
(Worf points a phaser at Troi) 
PICARD: No, Worf. 
DATA: You will only harm Counsellor Troi's body. 
PICARD: We are not invaders. We are explorers. 
TROI: Your knowledge of us is unacceptable. 
DATA: They are xenophobes, sir. Isolationists. The Paxans terraformed a
protoplanet in this system in order to better conceal their
whereabouts. The apparent wormhole we experienced is actually a trap
designed to keep out invaders. The energy field stuns everyone on board
the invading vessel and places them in a state of biochemical stasis. 
LAFORGE: That explains why our beards didn't grow. 
DATA: The Paxans then take the ship out of their territory. 
RIKER: So the crew wakes up and thinks they've been through a wormhole,
count their blessings and keep going. 
DATA: Precisely. 
PICARD: What went wrong this time? 
DATA: My positronic brain is a technology unknown to the Paxans. 
TROI: Our stun field had no effect on him. He remained conscious while
we tried to take over the ship. 
DATA: When I realised the crew was incapacitated, I initiated emergency
procedures
