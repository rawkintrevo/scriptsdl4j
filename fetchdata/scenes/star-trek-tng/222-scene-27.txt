RIKER: Any luck? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, take a look at this. We tried radiating the subject
matter with just about everything we could think of. We didn't find
anything until we subjected it to a high frequency warp field. We think
this is what we've been running into. 
RIKER: Do you know what it is? 
LAFORGE: We think so, now that the sensors can read it. It seems to be
a highly cohesive form of plasma, like a strand of energy. 
SUTTER: We figure it's a segment of just part of a network of much
larger strands. 
LAFORGE: When these things come in contact with our shields it produces
a resonant effect, and that creates the drag coefficient we've been
experiencing. 
RIKER: Is there anything like this on record? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. 
RIKER: Do you know how many of them there might be? 
LAFORGE: No, but if we run the warp field generators through the
deflector grid, we could radiate a field outside the ship. 
RIKER: And we'd be able to see for ourselves. Let's do it.

TROI: Alexander, I thought you might like a
partner. This is Clara Sutter. She's new on the Enterprise. Clara, meet
Alexander Rozhenko. 
ALEXANDER: I'm making a cup for my father. Want to help? 
TROI: Go ahead. 
(Clara adds a point to the side of the goblet at random) 
ALEXANDER: Well, you're supposed to put them in a row, like this. 
TROI: Clara, would you like some clay of your own? 
TEACHER: Here, honey. 
(and puts a protective gown on her) 
CLARA: I've never made a cup before. How do you make the round part? 
ALEXANDER: Well, it's easy. You take a big piece of clay like this, and
push your hand into it.

[Bridge]

WORF: Warp field generators are standing by. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we should be able to illuminate any strands within
two thousand kilometres of the ship. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
LAFORGE: Initiating field generation. 
PICARD: Remarkable. 
(there are lots of red strands, like a loose spider web) 
DATA: It is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty seven
million strands of energy. 
LAFORGE: Captain, with this many of them, the resonant effect on our
shields could cause a problem. 
PICARD: Agreed. Ensign, bring us about. Take us out of the nebula. 
DATA: It may be difficult, sir. I am detecting a significant number of
strands behind us. 
PICARD: Do your best, Ensign. 
FELTON: Aye, sir.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Hot chocolate. Computer, I need my
appointment schedule for next week. 
(the cup of chocolate falls over on its own. She picks it up, gets a
cloth and when she comes back, the cup is on its side again)

[Daycare centre]

ALEXANDER: Kryonian Tigers aren't so scary. I saw
one once. 
CLARA: You did? 
ALEXANDER: My father took me to the zoo on Brentalia. All the tiger did
was lick my hand. And he smelled funny. 
CLARA: I think we need more water. 
ALEXANDER: I'll get some. 
(Alexander walks off, and a piece of clay on a tray falls over and
squashes the goblet) 
CLARA: Isabella? 
ALEXANDER: Clara! 
CLARA: I didn't do it. 
ALEXANDER: Who did? 
CLARA: It was Isabella. 
ALEXANDER: I don't see anybody. 
CLARA: She's invisible. 
ALEXANDER: I spent two weeks on that. That was really mean. 
CLARA: I didn't do it. I didn't. 
ALEXANDER: Clara, there's no such thing as invisible people. You're
lying. 
(a piece of clay hits him from behind) 
ALEXANDER: Hey! 
CLARA: Isabella, stop! 
(Clara runs out)

[Arboretum]

(and into the arboretum for a good cry) 
ISABELLA: Clara. 
CLARA: Why were you being so mean to me? Why'd you do that to my
friend? 
ISABELLA: Because you ran away from me. You left me alone. I had to do
everything by myself. 
CLARA: You're scaring me. 
ISABELLA: I was going to protect you, Clara. I liked you. But now I
don't care. Now, when the others come, you can die along with everyone
else.
