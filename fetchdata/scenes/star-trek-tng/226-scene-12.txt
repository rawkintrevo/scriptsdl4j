[Alley]

(The bellboy runs out the back of the hotel, past
an old man muttering to himself) 
GUEST4: Help out a Forty Niner. Fell down a shaft. Forty Niner. Help
me. Help me out. 
(a tall slim elegantly dressed man with a snake's head cane and a tall
slim elegantly dressed woman with a case approach) 
GUEST4: No. No. 
(a beam comes from the woman's case to the beggar, and he dies.) 
Captain's log, supplemental. Close range sensor
analysis has yielded no further trace of Commander Data. Despite the
emotional repercussions among my crew, I must move this mission
forward.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: I'm not willing to accept that he's dead and
just leave it at that. 
PICARD: We cannot make Mister Data our priority. 
RIKER: What is more important than Data? 
TROI: Look at what we have so far. Evidence that these aliens have been
travelling back in time to Earth. 
CRUSHER: What if they're trying to undermine our history for some
reason. 
WORF: Some kind of guerilla war? 
PICARD: We must assume that there is a threat, if not to us then to
19th century Earth. We have to determine what that threat may be.
Mister La Forge, we have to find some way to communicate with these
life forms. 
LAFORGE: It's not going to be easy to reproduce what Data did. We can
create a contained subspace field, but we'd need an extraordinarily
sensitive phase discriminator to get that point zero zero four
variance. 
PICARD: Can you build one? 
LAFORGE: It won't be as good as Data's. 
RIKER: Will it be good enough? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I can try. It's going to take some time though. 
PICARD: I don't want anyone else going in alone. 
LAFORGE: I can probably create a large enough subspace field to
encompass everyone. But adjusting the phase inside the field, that's
going to be the hard part. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
RIKER: We have to assume one thing, sir. Wherever Data may be, he's
doing the same thing we are, which is trying to get to the bottom of
this. He may have a better idea about what's going on than we do, so it
might be in the best interests of this mission to find him. 
PICARD: Perhaps in the course of this investigation, we will. I hope
so. 
WORF: If we find Commander Data, it may be our fate to die with him in
the past. If our remains are in that cavern, they would have turned to
dust long ago.
