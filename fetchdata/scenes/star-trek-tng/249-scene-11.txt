[Kahless' quarters]

GUEST1: Everything will be all right. We will say
that Gowron used a dishonourable tactic in his fight with Kahless. 
GUEST2: That he cheated. 
WORF: That is a lie. He did not 
GUEST1: We do not need to hear any more from the son of Mogh. None of
this would have happened if you hadn't brought them together. 
GUEST0: I am Kahless, I am the strongest, the bravest warrior. 
GUEST2: Do not think about what happened. You must think of the future,
of the Empire. 
WORF: There is no future here. No glorious new era for our people.
Gowron was right. You did not know the name of the man who faced the
storm. You do not even know what real warnog tastes like. And you
certainly are not the greatest warrior of all. Whoever you are, you are
not Kahless. 
GUEST1: You have said enough. Now get out! 
WORF: You are using the name of Kahless for some twisted game. For that
alone, you should die. And if you do not tell me what you have done, I
will kill you right here. 
GUEST1: The problems with your memory are the result of the way you
returned. 
GUEST0: What do you mean? 
GUEST1: We, the Guardians, have been awaiting your return for
centuries, but we did not have the technology to bring you back. Until
now. We were able to use an organic sample of the first Kahless to give
you life. 
GUEST0: The first Kahless? 
WORF: A clone. He is a clone. 
GUEST0: What is a clone? 
WORF: A being created in a laboratory by genetic material taken from
another being. You are a copy. A fraud. 
GUEST1: You are not just a copy. We gave you more than the body of
Kahless. 
GUEST2: We found a way to imprint specific information in your
neurosynaptic patterns. We gave you memories, and not just any
memories. We gave you the experiences of Kahless as written in the
sacred texts. 
GUEST0: So, I did not do any of the things that I remember. I was
never at the city of Quin'lat. I never went to the Kri'stat volcano. 
GUEST1: You were not awakened until we transported you into the cave
and you appeared to Worf. Before that time you were unconscious in a
laboratory where we accelerated your growth, corrected any genetic
anomalies that occurred, gave you the wisdom and memories that 
WORF: They grew you in a test tube like some kind of fungus and
programmed you like a machine. 
GUEST1: You are twisting the truth. 
WORF: You talk to me of truth? You, who have brought to life this lie
and called it Kahless? 
GUEST1: It is not a lie. Genetically, he is Kahless, and he is needed
by our people. You know better than anyone the corruption and dishonour
that has destroyed the Empire. They need him. 
WORF: They do not need a false god. 
GUEST1: How do you know that this is not the way the prophesy was to be
fulfilled? Who is to say that what we did was wrong? 
WORF: I am. I will not let this fraud continue. 
GUEST1: Worf! You cannot tell Gowron of this. 
WORF: Do not give me orders, Koroth. 
GUEST1: All right, but consider this. If you tell Gowron what we have
told you, it will destroy him. (Kahless) And with him, the last chance
to restore hope to our people. It's your choice.
