PICARD [OC]: Back where it belongs? 
LAFORGE: We'd need to apply a delta vee of about four kilometres per
second. Even with warp power to the tractor beam, it would mean
exceeding recommended impulse engine output by at least forty-seven
percent. It'd be like 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: An ant pushing a tricycle. A slim
chance at best. 
RIKER: Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, contact all ships in this sector to rendezvous
and join us in relief efforts. 
PICARD: We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out. 
(The tiny tractor beam is sent out against the huge moon) 
RIKER: Can you give us any more, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Not without burning out the tractor beam emitter. The
circuits are already beyond the thermal limit. 
DATA: Delta vee is ninety two metres per second. The mass is too great.
We are having an effect but it is negligible. 
(A high-pitched noise penetrates the Bridge) 
RIKER: What is that? 
DATA: Unable to identify source.
