PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker, come in. Where are you?

hard, sir.

PICARD: And Farpoint Station? Any damage there? 
RIKER [OC]: Negative on damage to Farpoint, sir. Whoever they are, it
seems they're carefully avoiding hitting the station. 
PICARD: It's from an unidentified vessel that's entered into orbit with
us here.

PICARD [OC]: No ID, no answer to our signals.
