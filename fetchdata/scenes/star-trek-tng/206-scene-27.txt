ROBIN PICARD RIKER LAFORGE WESLEY

[Engineering]

WESLEY: I think we're going to be okay. I've just
got one more thing to do. Help me compile the forcefield overrides. 
ROBIN: What are you doing? 
WESLEY: I created a site to site transporter programme. If things get
difficult, this'll keep us one step ahead of them. Were able to access
the security tracking codes? Robin? 
ROBIN: It's your turn, Wesley. Play the game. 
(Riker and Worf approach, Wesley runs) 
RIKER: Get back here! 
[Corridor]

RIKER: Computer, activate security containment
field. Deck thirty six, section fifty two. 
(Wesley runs up against the forcefield) 
WESLEY: Computer transport programme Crusher One.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Bridge. We lost Crusher. It
appears he rigged a site-to-site transport. 
PICARD: Security alert, condition three. Computer, shut down all
transporter systems and shuttlebays. Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: I can't track him, sir. He's done something to the internal
security sensors. I'll try bypassing his subcommands. Hold on. I'm
picking up a piece of his trail, sir. Sensors show power activation in
transporter room three. That would put him somewhere on deck six. 
PICARD: Seal off deck six. Activate security fields sections twenty
three through twenty nine. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
