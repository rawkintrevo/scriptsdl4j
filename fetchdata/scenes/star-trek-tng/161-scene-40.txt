suggest metres falls ready compensate need output encompass air

[Bridge]

RIKER: Engineering, holding at station keeping,
range six hundred and forty metres. 
DATA [OC]: Containment fields to flight tolerance.

[Engineering]

DATA: Warp core to ninety percent. 
LAFORGE: Engage field coils. Tractor beam to stand by. Field output?
(nudges Q) Field output? 
Q: Two seventeen. 
LAFORGE: Impulse engines to full. Ready to engage tractor beam. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Lowering shields. Engage tractor beam.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Extending warp field forward. 
PICARD [OC]: Engineering, is that the forward limit? 
DATA: Yes, Captain. We are unable to encompass the entire moon. 
PICARD [OC]: Do you recommend that we proceed? 
Q: The two parts of the moon will have different inertial densities. 
LAFORGE: Stand by, Captain. I can adjust the field symmetry to
compensate. 
Q: I doubt it. 
LAFORGE: You don't know what this ship can do, Mister. Yes, Captain, I
still believe it'll work. Increasing power and warp field and tractor
beam. 
Q: And if you're wrong, the moon will crumble due to subspace
compression. Don't say I didn't warn you. 
LAFORGE: Shut up, Q. 
Q: I will not be spoken to in this manner! 
LAFORGE: Data. 
DATA: Q, I strongly suggest that you cooperate. 
DATA: Inertial mass of the moon is decreasing to approximately two
point five million metric tonnes.
LAFORGE: It's working. We can move it. Firing impulse engines.

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Captain, the moon's trajectory has moved
point three percent. Point-four percent. 
WORF: Emergency! Shields up. 
RIKER: Disengage tractor beam. 
WORF: Calamarain attacking. (big jolt) Shields holding. Tachyon field
repelled. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, the impact of the blast is pushing us into the
upper atmosphere.

[Engineering]

DATA: Hull temperature rising. Two thousand
degrees. 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Two thousand five hundred degrees. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Moving to full impulse power. 
WORF: Calamarain resuming attack. 
(The ship is filled with bright light again) 
WORF: They've overpowered the shields. Hull penetration, deck thirty
six, Engineering. 
RIKER: Geordi, can you direct any more power to the shields?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We need all the power we have to get out
of the atmosphere, Commander. 
(Once again, the light wraps itself around Q) 
LAFORGE: Try activating the structural integrity field. 
(Q is pulled into the air. Data grabs his legs and the light wraps
around him, too) 
LAFORGE: It's not working. Structural field harmonics on manual. 
RIKER [OC]: La Forge. Hull temperature falling. We're in the clear. 
LAFORGE: Diverting power to forward sections now. 
(Q falls back to the deck, Data also falls over, with residual
electricity running over his body)
