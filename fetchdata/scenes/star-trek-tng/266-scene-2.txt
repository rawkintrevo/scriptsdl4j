DATA MATURIN LAFORGE
originating unexpected working analyse hope activity trying desert worry

[Engineering]

DATA: The colony's aqueduct system is functioning
normally, as are the communication relays. 
MATURIN: We've been having a few tremors over the past couple of
months. Could you check the seismic stabilisers? 
DATA: Certainly. 
MATURIN: You can't imagine what it's like trying to enjoy afternoon tea
while the earth is shaking. 
LAFORGE: Governor, did you know you had a power fluctuation in your
weather control system? 
MATURIN: No. Our weather control's been working perfectly for the last
twenty two years. 
LAFORGE: I can't isolate the exact source, but the fluctuation seems to
be originating from one of the substations that regulates atmospheric
humidity for the colony. 
MATURIN: Is this going to be a problem? 
LAFORGE: No, not yet, but power distribution patterns are already off
by five percent. 
DATA: I suggest we analyse the planet's weather patterns to see if they
have been affected. I am reading unusually high humidity across the
entire southern desert region and there is increasing cloud activity
above the northern coastal area. Possibly the formation of a storm
system. 
MATURIN: A storm? It's the middle of summer. We don't have rain at this
time of year. 
LAFORGE: Data, let's see if we can correct this. I'll check out the
colony's climatic flow array. 
DATA: I will run a diagnostic on the thermal regulators. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry, Governor. We'll keep you dry. 
MATURIN: I certainly hope so. There's a caber toss scheduled for
tomorrow afternoon. I'd hate to see it spoiled by an unexpected
downpour.
