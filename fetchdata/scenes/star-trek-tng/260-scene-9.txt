[Planet surface]

(Picard and Crusher walk out of a large cave
entrance into a lightly wooded countryside and walk down a slope) 
PICARD: One of us is hungry. 
CRUSHER: That would be me. 
PICARD: Do you mind thinking of something else. You're making me
hungry. 
CRUSHER: What do you want me to think about? 
PICARD: Something other than a large bowl of vegetable soup. 
CRUSHER: My grandmother used to make it, with peas, carrots and 
PICARD: Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. 
PICARD: I am not being unreasonable. 
CRUSHER: I didn't say that you were. I may have thought it, but there's
a difference. 
PICARD: You're right. We can't react to every random thought that
crosses the other person's mind. Isn't astonishing, though, how much
clutter there is in a consciousness. Odd memories coming to the
surface. Bits
of half-remembered songs. 
CRUSHER: Stray day dreams, scattered minutiae. I wonder how true
telepaths sift through it all. How can they really get to what
someone's thinking if the minds keeps churning all this flotsam to the
surface? That is not funny. 
PICARD: I just wanted to see if you were still listening. 
CRUSHER: I think our link is getting stronger. 
PICARD: Maybe if we put some distance between us, that might weaken it.
Not that I'm growing tired of hearing your most intimate thoughts. 
CRUSHER: Certainly not. 
(they separate, then start to stagger) 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: What happened? 
CRUSHER: I was suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. 
PICARD: Me, too. 
CRUSHER: There's nothing wrong with either of us. Maybe the air is
toxic. 
(she moves away again, then back quickly) 
PICARD: The same thing. But when you moved back toward me it got
better. Well, it seems as if we're stuck with each other.
(some way further on) 
PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: I'm not sure whether we should go over this hill or that one.
The topography on this map is a little vague. 
PICARD: Let me see. This way. 
CRUSHER: You don't really know, do you? 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: I mean, you're acting like you know exactly which way to go,
but you're only guessing. Do you do this all the time? 
PICARD: No, but there are times when it is necessary for a captain to
give the appearance of confidence. 
(they walk on a little way then he looks at her) 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just couldn't resist. 
PICARD: I'm beginning to realise that you seem to always have some
acerbic remark on the tip of your tongue. 
CRUSHER: Well at least I've trained myself not to say it anymore. When
I was a little girl, my mouth was always landing me in trouble with my
parents, my teachers. 
PICARD: Your friends. There was someone called Tom Norris? 
CRUSHER: That's right. I had one date with him which I brought to an
abrupt halt with the words, is that a beard or 
GUEST4: Is your face dirty? 
PICARD: There's something more. You're laughing, but actually you're
embarrassed by that incident. 
CRUSHER: Yes. I thought I was being cute but I really hurt him. That
was a long time ago. I learned a valuable lesson. 
PICARD: This sharing of thoughts and feelings is quite compelling. 
CRUSHER: Very. We'd better get going. 
(they slither down a loose rock slope then duck behind cover when they
see a Prytt soldier on the next ridge) 
CRUSHER: I don't think so, either. Maybe we can find another way to
reach the village. 
PICARD: No. It's several kilometres to find another way around that
ridge. The border is just two kilometres east of here. There's a
forcefield protecting it, but we can find some way to deal with that
when we get there. Come on.
