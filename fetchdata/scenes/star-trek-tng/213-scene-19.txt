[Bridge]

DATA: Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters.
EPS power levels rising. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Transferring warp power to tractor beam
generator. 
HANNAH: Graviton generators operating normally. Surge pulse now
synchronised. Emitters radiating at three hundred twenty percent over
standard. 
LAFORGE: Bridge, we need more power.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Reduce life support to minimum requirements,
Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

HANNAH: Three hundred ninety percent over standard.

LAFORGE: Come on, come on. 
HANNAH: No change in the fragment's course. 
LAFORGE: We've got to increase the pulse frequency. 
HANNAH: The emitter circuits won't hold for long. 
LAFORGE: We won't need them for long. 
HANNAH: Four hundred percent over standard. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Now we're getting there. 
HANNAH: The fragment's moved point four degrees off its previous
heading. Point six five. It's working.

[Bridge]

DATA: We have lost one of the emitter circuits. 
WORF: Life support failure. Decks nine, twelve, and thirteen. 
RIKER: Engage evacuation procedures for those decks. Geordi, we're
going to need power back soon. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Engineering]

HANNAH: Fragment's new heading adjustment is at one
point zero one degrees. Is it enough? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. Hold on. 
DATA [OC]: We've lost
