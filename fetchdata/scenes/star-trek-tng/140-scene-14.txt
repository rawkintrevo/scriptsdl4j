PICARD: You've seen your mission briefing? 
RIKER: Yes, I have. 
PICARD: Any questions? 
RIKER: No, other than a question about the Ares's First Officer. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. His name is Flaherty. 
RIKER: Yes. The briefing mentions something about an uncanny linguistic
skill. 
PICARD: That is an understatement, Number One. The last time I saw
Commander Flaherty, he spoke forty languages. As I recall, among the
more exotic were Romulan, Klingon, Giamon, Stroyerian. 
RIKER: He speaks forty languages? 
PICARD: He has this unique ability of instantaneously interpreting and
extrapolating any verbal communication that he hears. You will find him
very useful in Sector Vega-Omicron. 
RIKER: Yes, I'm sure I will. 
(Doorbell) 
RIKER: Come in. 
KYLE: Oh, Captain Picard, at last. I'd like to thank you for all the
help you've been to my son. 
PICARD: My only regret is that your reunion marks Will's farewell. 
KYLE: But he's ready for this command. 
PICARD: Oh, yes, I have no doubt. 
KYLE: Captain, may I have a word with my son? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Excuse me, gentlemen. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: I won't be pushed into this decision. 
KYLE: Oh, come on, Will. Don't you think you're ready for the Ares? 
RIKER: Starfleet does. 
KYLE: Of course. Because you're the best candidate for the job. I only
want you to know I'm here if you need me. 
RIKER: I've been on my own since I was fifteen. I can take care of
myself. 
KYLE: Please, spare me the pain of your childhood. I hung in for
thirteen years. If that wasn't enough, it's just too bad.

LAFORGE: Data, what if I missed something? 
DATA: The ship's computer would have corrected immediately. 
LAFORGE: Maybe my inputs were incorrect. 
WESLEY: Data! Geordi! I figured out Worf's problem. 
LAFORGE: You spoke to him? 
WESLEY: No, no. I accessed the complete Klingon cultural database. It
took me some time 
LAFORGE: Okay, Wesley, slow down. What is the problem? 
WESLEY: It's the tenth anniversary of Worf's Age of Ascension. 
LAFORGE: His what? 
WESLEY: The Klingon Age of Ascension. It's a ritual of great
significance. A rite of initiation marking a new level of Klingon
spiritual attainment. 
DATA: And what is the significance of the anniversary of this event? 
WESLEY: It's a day of celebration and ritual spent with one's fellow
Klingons. Worf doesn't have any Klingon friends. 
LAFORGE: We're his friends. 
WESLEY: Right, but we don't practice Klingon tradition, And we're not
Klingons. Worf is feeling culturally and socially isolated. 
LAFORGE: So, what do you suggest we do? I'm not sure I'd like to invite
a bunch of Klingons on board. 
DATA: We can programme the ship's computer to supply simulations on the
Holodeck. 
LAFORGE: Holographic Klingons. Sure. Why not? 
DATA: We need only to programme the computer with details of the
specific ceremony. 
WESLEY: The cultural database said the Klingon's family must attend. 
LAFORGE: So? We're his family. We'll go. I just wonder what kind of
party the Klingons had in mind.
