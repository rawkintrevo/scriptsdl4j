PICARD CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Laboratory]

DATA: We are ready to bring the interface online,
sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Proceed. 
DATA: Activating the remote sensors. Initiating interface now. 
CRUSHER: Vital signs normal. Geordi, how do you feel? 
LAFORGE: Fine. 
DATA: Do you have visual contact? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. 
[Raman corridor]

LAFORGE: Data, turn up the input sensors. I'm not
seeing anything. 
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged. 
LAFORGE: Okay, I can see. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: But no colours. 
DATA: Increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance. 
LAFORGE: Ah, that's better. 
CRUSHER: Your pulse has gone up. Your nervous system probably has to
get used to the input levels. 
LAFORGE: I'm excited, that's all, Doctor. This is like being on a
roller coaster. Or a first date. I'm all right. 
CRUSHER: I'll be the judge of that. If your heart rate gets too high,
we're going to disconnect you. 
LAFORGE: Understood. 
[Raman corridor]

LAFORGE: It's a mess in here. There must be a
breach in the hull someplace. I'm picking up atmospheric gasses in the
corridor. Methane and ammonia, primarily. That break in the hull might
even be on the Bridge itself.
I'm heading towards the Bridge. I've found someone. 
DATA [OC]: What is your position? 
LAFORGE: About twelve metres up the main corridor. He's trapped under
some conduit from the bulkhead. I can't move it. I'm going to need more
power to the tractor beam. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Go to eighty percent of tolerance, Data. No higher. 
(Geordi pulls off a metal bar and checks the man's pulse) 
LAFORGE: He's dead. Data, that door at the end of this corridor. What's
it lead to? 
DATA [OC]: A magnetic storage bay. 
LAFORGE: If there was a break in the Bridge, that'd be the safest place
to go. Data, give me a phaser burst. Narrow focus, level four
intensity. 
(Geordi blows the lock off the door) 
LAFORGE: I've found them. They're dead. All of them. There's a fire in
here. Argh!

[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: Data, disconnect! What happened? Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. My hands. 
CRUSHER: They're burned.
