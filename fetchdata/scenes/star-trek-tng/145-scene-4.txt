[Corridor]

RIKER: Just down this corridor. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: He has nice legs too, Little One. Is he still
yours? 
TROI [telepath]: Humans no longer own each other that way, Mother. 
LWAXANA: Really? That's a custom we may have to introduce again.

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: Thank you. 
RIKER: Glad to help. 
(Riker leaves, Homn picks up the case as if it were empty) 
PICARD: Well, I trust you will be comfortable here. If you will excuse
me. 
LWAXANA: I am be serving a Betazoid dinner of greeting tonight,
Captain. It is an ambassadorial function. 
PICARD: It sounds delightful. 
(Picard leaves) 
LWAXANA: He's a fine man. Solid, reliable. He's a little on the stuffy
side, but, all in all, he's not that bad. 
TROI: I can't believe you, Mother. You sound like you're sizing up a
commodity. 
LWAXANA: But that's exactly what men are, darling. Especially human
men. Was your father ever unhappy with me? 
TROI: No. He worshipped you. But I don't think I'll ever learn to see
men the way you do. 
LWAXANA: You will as you mature, darling. And the men in your life are
going to bless you for it. You're so beautiful.
