[Picard's quarters]

(Jono has rigged up a hammock near the ceiling) 
PICARD: Computer, turn off that noise! Computer, what was that? 
COMPUTER: The Alba Ra, a contemporary Talarian musical form. 
PICARD: Jono? Jono, where are you? 
JONO: You turned off my music. 
PICARD: Yes, I certainly did, and I expect it to stay turned off. Would
you come down from there? I see you've made yourself at home. 
JONO: I cannot rest on your beds. They hurt my back. 
PICARD: Would you come here. There's something I want to show you. 
(it's a slide show in a frame) 
PICARD: Those are Connor and Moira Rossa. They are your parents. The
baby is you. Jeremiah Rossa. 
JONO: My name is Jono. 
PICARD: Well, you were born Jeremiah on Galen Four. The colony was
destroyed later, during a border skirmish. 
(changes the picture to a laughing child) 
PICARD: You see? You knew how to laugh once. Do you remember any of
this, Jono? Your parents, your home? 
JONO: I know that Endar rescued me. He told me so. 
PICARD: Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians. 
JONO: It was war. Death is part of war. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, what is it, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: We've established visual contact with the warship Q'Maire. 
JONO: Endar! 
PICARD: Hey, hey! You stay put. I'm on my way, Number One. 
(Picard leaves, and Jono takes a look at some more of the pictures. He
remembers) 
CONNOR [OC]: Get to cover! 
MOIRA [OC]: I can't leave you! 
CONNOR [OC]: Take Jeremiah. Take him to the forest. I'll hold them off.

MOIRA [OC]: No! No! Come with us! Jeremiah! 
JEREMIAH [OC]: Momma! 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Status, Mister Data? 
DATA: Q'Maire at station, holding steady at bearing zero one three,
mark zero one five. Distance five oh six kilometres. 
PICARD: Are its weapons systems active? 
DATA: Negative, sir. 
WORF: Captain Endar requests an open channel, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. 
ENDAR: I am Captain Endar of the warship Q'Maire. To whom am I
speaking? 
PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
We have rescued four crew members from your observation craft. They
have received medical attention. The are ready for transport. 
ENDAR: Your actions are duly noted. We will forward coordinates for
immediate transport. 
RIKER: You're welcome, I'm sure. 
PICARD: One moment, Captain. We've also discovered a human among your
crew. 
ENDAR: Jono. 
PICARD: Actually, his name is Jeremiah, Jeremiah Rossa. 
ENDAR: What is his condition? Is he injured? 
PICARD: He was not wounded in the mishap, but as a representative of
the Federation, I require an explanation. Why has this child been held
in your custody for so many years? 
ENDAR: No explanation is warranted, Captain. He is my son.

Captain's log, supplemental. Captain Endar's claim
that Jeremiah Rossa is his son is clearly unacceptable. However, to
avoid escalating tensions, I have invited the Talarian leader to come
aboard the Enterprise so that we may address the issue face to face.
