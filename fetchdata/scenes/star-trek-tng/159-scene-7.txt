DATA: We followed procedures precisely, Captain.
Scanners indicated no life forms present in the drive section. I cannot
explain how he escaped. 
WORF: Incoming message from the Angosian Prime Minister. 
PICARD: On screen. 
NAYROK [on viewscreen]: Captain, we've identified the prisoner. His
name is Roga Danar. His criminal record is too long to go into, but I
must caution you that he is given to bouts of uncontrollable violence. 
PICARD: I appreciate your warning, Prime Minister. We will keep you
informed of our progress.

RIKER: Geordi, how far and how fast can that transport ship travel? 
LAFORGE: Without warp drive, there's no way he could be out of our
range by now. 
WESLEY: We've been sweeping the area constantly, Commander. There's
nothing within sensor range. 
PICARD: A cloaking device? 
WORF: Sir, the Angosians have no cloaking technology. 
RIKER: Unless he's borrowing one. If he's hanging over the planet's
pole, the magnetic field would confuse our sensors. 
DATA: Commander, I believe I can recalibrate our sensors to read
through the electromagnetic interference over the poles. 
RIKER: Let's try it. Mister Crusher, realign for polar orbit. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
DATA: There he is, Commander. You were correct. 
RIKER: This guy knows all the tricks, doesn't he. 
DATA: There are still no life form readings coming from the vessel. 
LAFORGE: Could it be the magnetic interference, Data? 
DATA: I have compensated. Still no readings. 
PICARD: We'll have an answer shortly. Lock on tractor beam, Mister La
Forge. 
LAFORGE: Tractor beam locking on, sir. 
DATA: He is coming about, sir. 
RIKER: He's out of his mind! 
WORF: Sensors detect a massive power build up in his aft thrusters. 
PICARD: On main viewer. 
LAFORGE: He's making a suicide run. 
DATA: Shields have been automatically activated. Tractor beam
disengaged. 
WESLEY: He bounced off the shields. 
RIKER: That's an interesting twist. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, fix coordinates onto that vessel. We'll just
beam the whole thing to a shuttlebay if we have to. 
DATA: I do not believe that will be necessary, Captain. He is no longer
in the drive section. 
PICARD: What? 
DATA: I anticipated that diversionary tactic based on his pattern to
date. We are picking up a cylindrical object approximately seven metres
in length and three metres in diameter. 
WORF: On screen. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
WESLEY: An escape pod. 
LAFORGE: This guy's incredible. 
DATA: Yet there are still no life form readings. 
PICARD: Transporter room four, prepare to beam aboard from inside that
shuttle anything large enough to be a humanoid adult. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Security team, report to transporter room four. 
SECURITY [OC]: On our way, sir. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: We're holding the contents in stasis
pending arrival of security. An illicit weapon has been detected in the
transport beam, sir. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: It's been rendered inoperable. 
RIKER: Work, let's greet our guest.
