PICARD TROI COMPUTER MADELINE LWAXANA

[Outside the Holodeck]

PICARD: Setting, San Francisco California, United
States Of America. The year, 1945 A.D. The office of Dixon Hill,
Private Investigator. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. You may enter when ready.

[Hill's outer office]

MADELINE: Hi, Dix. 
PICARD: Madeline. Good to see you again. 
MADELINE: You're too much, Dix. You make it sound like you ain't seen
me in a year. You got two calls. They're on your desk. 
PICARD: New cases? 
MADELINE: Are you kidding? The last time we had a new case, Hitler and
Stalin were
bosom buddies. The landlord came by. He wants the geetas or he wants
you out. 
PICARD: The geetas? 
MADELINE: The moolah, Dix. The rent. And since we're on the subject,
it's been a month since I seen anything. Now I know it's been
tough, since you got out of the hospital, but I got responsibilities. 
PICARD: Then I suppose I had better get a case. 
MADELINE: It wouldn't hurt. 
[Hill's office]

(Picard takes off his coat and hat, turns on the
radio and looks around. The song is 'Let's Get Away From It All, sung
by a group that sounds like the Beverly Sisters. He sits down, puts his
feet up on the desk and relaxes)

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: Unavailable? Ship's business? You mean
ship's business takes precedence over me? 
TROI: I'm afraid so, Mother. 
LWAXANA: Oh, well, he was too old for me anyway. Homn, perhaps we
should consider my alternate plan. 
TROI: Alternate plan? 
LWAXANA: You worry too much, Little One. Your mother has the situation
well in hand.
