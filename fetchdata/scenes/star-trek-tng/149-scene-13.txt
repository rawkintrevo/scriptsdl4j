PICARD: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrange
transport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to move
quickly. 
[Ard'rian's home]

DATA: Aye, sir. We must speak to Gosheven
immediately.

[Transporter room]

(A test object is beamed out successfully, but
returns as a molten blob. Riker enters) 
RIKER: Gentlemen, how's it coming? What the hell is that? 
LAFORGE: Our first attempt. 
RIKER: Keep at it. We need those transporters. 
[Main square]

(It is evening) 
GOSHEVEN: You see this? Do you have any idea what it is, or what it
means? 
DATA: It is water. A substance composed of two atoms of hydrogen 
GOSHEVEN: It's not water. It's blood and it's sweat. It's the result of
a ninety years of combined effort. This isn't a town. It's a monument
to every man, woman, and child who's lived and died on Tau Cygna Five. 
ARD'RIAN: Gosheven, you're talking nonsense. 
GOSHEVEN: Am I? My grandfather is buried on that mountain. He died in a
rock slide surveying the route for this aqueduct. This colony exists
because of his sacrifice, and the sacrifice of thousands of others. No,
we're not leaving. 
DATA: The Sheliak will not accept humans on their planet, And they will
not hesitate to use force to remove you. 
GOSHEVEN: We will not be bullied off our land. Not by you, and not by
the Sheliak. 
(Gosheven walks away) 
ARD'RIAN: Stubborn and irrational. Now what do we do? 
DATA: Are his sentiments typical of the colonists? 
ARD'RIAN: I hope not. 
DATA: If I can convince enough people of the necessity of leaving 
ARD'RIAN: Don't you mean, if we can convince?
