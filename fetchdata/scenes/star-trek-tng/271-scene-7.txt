BARCLAY: We removed the torpedo bay's primary
guidance module and found a power fluctuation in the forward sensor
cluster. Now we think it may be a radial imbalance in the phase
discriminator. Now what we want to do next is run a level four
diagnostic, but we're going to have to shut down auxiliary power to
nineteen decks and 
RIKER: Wait a minute. Slow down. I lost you back there. Which sensor
clusters? 
BARCLAY: The forward. It's, it's a power fluctuation in the converter
nodes. It's a minor adjustment. It's minor. 
LAFORGE: It's all right in here in on diagram, Commander. 
RIKER: I'll look this over later. Go ahead. You run your diagnostic.
I'll inform the other departments about the power systems. 
(an alarm beeps) BARCLAY: I'll check that. 
RIKER: He's full of energy today. 
LAFORGE: I can't get him to slow down. He's been working like that
since last night, 
BARCLAY: Looks like a plasma conduit cut out in junction seventeen.
I'll go look at it. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute, Reg, I'll go with you. Keep you posted.

[Bridge]

(Troi is the Bridge Officer, and is shivering) 
TROI: Computer, increase ambient temperature by two degrees Centigrade
and increase relative humidity by ten percent. 
WORF: Computer, reset environmental controls to standard. 
TROI: Worf, it's freezing in here. 
WORF: You have already raised the temperature three times. It is too
hot. 
TROI: Live with it. Computer, execute my original command. 
(she finally can't stand it) 
TROI: I need a bath. You have the Bridge.
