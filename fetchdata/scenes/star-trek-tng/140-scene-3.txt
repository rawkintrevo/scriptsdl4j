[Bridge]

PICARD: Establish synchronous orbit. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Starbase Montgomery is sending a civilian advisor on board to
brief you on the Ares's mission. 
RIKER: A personal briefing? 
PICARD: A strategic attach with specialised knowledge in the frontier
regions. I think you'll find the briefing interesting. 
RIKER: I hope it's complete. Much of my decision will be based on it. 
HERBERT [OC]: Commander Riker to Transporter room three. 
PICARD: Enjoy.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Ensign. 
HERBERT: Ah, you're right on time, Commander. He's on his way now. 
(A fit, silver-haired man is beamed on board) 
RIKER: Dad. You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attach? 
KYLE: I asked Captain Picard to keep it quiet. I didn't want you to
make you nervous or excited. 
RIKER: It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriate
emotion. 
KYLE: You've done well. First Officer on the Enterprise. Quite a
feather in your cap. 
RIKER: I've worked hard. 
KYLE: Of course. I'm proud of you, son. 
RIKER: If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. When
you've settled in, we can complete our briefing.
Have Security arrange an escort for this gentleman. 
HERBERT: Aye, sir.
