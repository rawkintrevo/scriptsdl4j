LAFORGE: So why can't we move? Computer. As we
increased our power levels, was there any counter-reaction? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. The opposing force grew in direct proportion to
the power output of the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: So it kept us from forming a subspace field for the warp
drive? 
COMPUTER: That is correct. 
(He goes to a screen and calls up files) 
LAFORGE: Computer, who is this L. Brahms? 
COMPUTER: Doctor Leah Brahms, engineer. Graduate of the Daystrom
Institute Theoretical Propulsion Group. Galaxy class starships, team
seven, junior member. 
LAFORGE: Junior member, huh? Looks like she wrote the book on
propulsion. Call up subspace design logs. 
COMPUTER: Select menu. Visual records or L. Brahms' voice entries. 
LAFORGE: Voice entries. 
LEAH [OC]: Theoretical propulsion logs, Federation Starship Enterprise,
Galaxy class. Heading, Subspace. Author, Leah Brahms. 
LAFORGE: Geordi La Forge. How're you doing, Doc? 
LEAH [OC]: Specify programme. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, down to work. You're absolutely right.

CRUSHER: I recommend we evacuate and seal off all
non-operational areas, and group the families and crew on the
odd-numbered decks. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
CRUSHER: I'd also like to set up an assembly area for treating
radiation symptoms in case it's needed. 
PICARD: After the shields fall, how long before fatal exposure? 
CRUSHER: Thirty minutes. After that, there is nothing that can be done.

RIKER [OC]: Away team to Enterprise. Captain, we may have found
something. There's a file of memory 
[Warship Bridge]

RIKER: Coils here. 
DATA: They are identical to the coil we found earlier, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: The Captain's log, perhaps? 
RIKER: That's what we were thinking.
