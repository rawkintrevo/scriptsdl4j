(The cube is met by three ships, which are
immediately destroyed) 
WORF: It is confirmed. The Borg have broken through the Mars defence
perimeter. 
WESLEY: Enterprise now approaching Terran system, sir. 
RIKER: Slow to impulse. Time to intercept? 
WESLEY: Twenty-three minutes, fourteen seconds, sir.

[Data's lab]

DATA: Second neural connection is confirmed. I
still cannot report any significant access. Proceeding with the final
link. 
CRUSHER: Significant increase in premotor area and hypothalamus
activity. His heartbeat is accelerating rapidly. 
O'BRIEN: Sir, your submicron matrix activity is increasing
exponentially.
DATA: Neural connections complete. I have access to the Borg subspace
signals. Processing. Processing. 
TROI: Data! 
DATA: Stand by. Processing. Processing. Fascinating. The Borg group
consciousness is divided into subcommands necessary to carry out all
functions. Defence, communication, navigation. They are all controlled
by a root command implanted into each 
(Picard wakes up and tries to get out. Data restrains the mechanical
arm, then pulls off the working 'hand' component.)

CRUSHER: Data, I'm picking up increased neural activity in Captain
Picard, localised in the prefrontal and parietal lobes. 
O'BRIEN: The Borg might be trying to terminate their link with him. 
DATA: Negative. The subspace signal configuration is unchanged. What is
causing the increased neural activity is unclear. 
TROI: No, it's not. It's him. It's Picard. 
(Picard reaches out with his organic arm and takes hold of Data,
gently) 
TROI: Troi to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: Data has made first contact with Captain
Picard. 
RIKER: Can you communicate with him, Data?

[Data's lab]

DATA [OC]: I have been unable to create a neural
path around the Borg implants, sir. It is Captain Picard himself who
has somehow managed to initiate contact. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Borg have halted their approach to
Earth. 
SHELBY: I think we got their attention. 
RIKER: Time to intercept?
WESLEY: Two minutes, four seconds, sir. 
RIKER: They're worried. They're worried because we've got access to
Picard. Mister Data, we have two minutes to figure out what we can do
with it.

[Data's lab]

DATA: Sir, it is clear the Borg are either
unwilling or unable to terminate their subspace links. 
CRUSHER: That may be their Achilles heel, Captain. Their
interdependency. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: What do you mean, Doctor?
CRUSHER [OC]: He's 
[Data's lab]

CRUSHER: Part of their collective consciousness
now. Cutting him off would like asking one of us to disconnect an arm
or a foot

[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: We can't do it.
SHELBY: They operate as a single mind. 
RIKER: One jumps off a cliff, they all jump off? Data, is it possible
to plant a command into the Borg collective consciousness?
