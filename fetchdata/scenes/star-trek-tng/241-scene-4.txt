MARTA PICARD COREY NAUSICAAN Q

[Bonestell Facility casino]

MARTA: He's winning. 
PICARD: Of course. 
MARTA: I thought you had a date. 
PICARD: She decided to leave. 
MARTA: You're getting old, Johnny. 
(Corey bounces his ball off a light and down a hole in the middle of
the table) 
COREY: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. 
MARTA: Very, very nice. I think you should forget about Starfleet and
play dom-jot for a living. 
COREY: Nah, this is nothing. A little trigonometry, some minor wrist
action. Now barokie, there's a game. 
NAUSICAAN 1: Human! Play dom-jot, human. 
COREY: I think I could be persuaded to play one more game. 
PICARD: Corey, don't play him. 
COREY: Why? 
PICARD: It'll cause trouble. He's a Nausicaan. They can get very
ill-tempered if they lose. 
COREY: So can I. 
PICARD: No, Corey, listen to me. This is a big mistake. Don't play him.

COREY: What's gotten into you? Let's go. 
Q: I see you've found your Nausicaan friend. You seem unimpaled so far.

PICARD: I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
Q: Ensign Zweller seems to be doing well. 
PICARD: He's going to lose. The Nausicaan is cheating. 
Q: Really? I'm beginning to like these Nausicaans. 
PICARD: If history repeats itself, Corey will figure it out later
tonight, and then he'll want revenge. 
Q: And will you help your best friend avenge this injustice? 
PICARD: I did last time. I rigged the table so that he would win in a
rematch. 
Q: Picard, you cheated? Picard, I'm impressed. 
PICARD: It was a stupid mistake. The Nausicaan didn't take kindly to
losing. Nor his friends. They were outraged. They wanted a fight. I
gave them one. 
Q: That's a beautiful story. It gets you right here, doesn't it? 
NAUSICAAN 1: Ten. 
(the Nausicaan puts a bet down and makes his play, then laughs and pots
the winner) Dom-jot. Human play dom-jot.
