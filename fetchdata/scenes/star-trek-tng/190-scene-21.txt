seven added attempt observation maybe make door prototype longer

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: How long before the power drain becomes
critical, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: If it continues to increase at the current rate, six, maybe
seven hours. 
LEAH: We may be able to modify the engine to extend that a little
longer, Captain. 
PICARD: Your help would be appreciated, Doctor. 
LAFORGE: By then, Junior may not need us any more. 
PICARD: Mister Data, is there any way to determine what the destination
of the parent might have been? 
DATA: I can attempt to extrapolate from the heading it was on when we
encountered it, sir. 
CRUSHER: Perhaps it was its way to a safe and supportive environment
for its newborn. 
PICARD: We might be able to deliver it to the same destination. 
RIKER: Which brings up the question of how do we get Junior off the
hull once we get there. 
LEAH: It's almost completely covering the door of shuttlebay two. If we
open the door and deactivate the atmospheric force field. 
LAFORGE: the pressure from inside the ship might push it away from the
hull. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
DATA: Sir, is the appellation Junior to be the life form's official
name? 
PICARD: No, it is not.

[Corridor]

LEAH: We can save a lot of energy just by improving
engine efficiency. 
LAFORGE: We've run into similar problems before. That's actually why I
reoriented the dilithium crystal. 
LEAH: And why you added the mid-range phase adjusters? 
LAFORGE: Right. 
LEAH: Commander it seems that you've made a lot more modifications than
I'm aware of. Do you have a file on all the work you've done? 
LAFORGE: It's in the computer. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander, I need to see you on the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: On my way, Captain. You go on ahead, Doctor. Ensign Palvik can
show you the file on the engine modifications.

[Engineering]

LEAH: Phase coils upgraded to fifty five field
densities. Plasma inducers interlinked with generator. Ensign, would
there be any other files with data on the original engine
specifications? 
PAVLIK: (a young woman) I believe so, Doctor. 
(file 9140, holographic simulation) 
LEAH: This file utilises the prototype engine schematic. 
PAVLIK: It's a holographic programme, set in the drafting room at
Utopia Planitia. 
LEAH: I'll run it on holodeck three.
