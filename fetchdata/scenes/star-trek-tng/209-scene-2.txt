like worf cope la days distortion climatic numbers affect

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I'm afraid the numbers coming in are
already indicating climatic changes, Commander. 
RIKER: What kind of drop can we expect? 
DATA: If the Pentharan spheral forecasts are correct, ten to twelve
degrees Celsius within the first ten days. 
LAFORGE: If it continues like that, their entire ecosystem will be shot
to hell. 
RIKER: And I doubt they're prepared to cope with the kind of cold
that's coming. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Would you join me on the bridge, please. 
RIKER [OC]: Right away, sir. 
PICARD: Are you certain, Mister Worf? 
WORF: There was a space-time distortion, sir, and there is something
back there. We passed within three hundred kilometres of it. 
PICARD: It's too close to be a coincidence. Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: Would a delay of one hour affect your plans?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Not unless another asteroid decides to pay
a call on Penthara, sir. 
DATA: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely,
given the time frame. 
PICARD [OC]: Thank you, Mister Data.
