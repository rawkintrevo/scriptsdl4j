RIKER: Mind if I join you? 
WESLEY: No, sir. 
RIKER: Is there something wrong, Wes? Commander Kurn perhaps? 
WESLEY: He just doesn't seem to like me. I can't do anything right for
him. Every time I respond to an order he jumps down my throat. I don't
know what I'm doing wrong. 
RIKER: Problem, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. It's our new first officer. 
RIKER: I take it he found something wrong in Engineering? 
LAFORGE: Just the entire section. He pulled a surprise inspection in
the middle of a maintenance cycle! I tried to explain it to him 
RIKER: But he wouldn't listen. 
LAFORGE: We're all going to be doing double shifts down there just to
ready for the next inspection. 
RIKER: His style of command is just different. Klingons believe in
obedience and a strict formality of command. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but this isn't a Klingon vessel. He's going to have to
loosen up, Commander. 
WESLEY: It's not just us. He's been leaning into everybody pretty hard,
except 
LAFORGE: Except the one guy who wouldn't really mind it.

WORF: Sensors picking up asteroidal debris ahead,
Commander. 
KURN: Can you identify the coordinates, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Bearing zero zero one mark point oh three. Range, three hundred
thousand kilometres. 
KURN: Excellent. Please scan the asteroid field for me, Lieutenant, and
report. 
WORF: Approximately two thousand small objects. None in our direct
flight path, sir. 
KURN: So, no course correction is necessary. Is that what you are
saying? 
WORF: It should not be needed, sir. 
KURN: Very good, Lieutenant. You handled that well. 
(Worf starts to square up to him) 
KURN: Yes?
