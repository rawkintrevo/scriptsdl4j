[Molly's bedroom]

O'BRIEN: What's wrong, Sweetheart? 
GUEST5: I want Mommy to read me a story. 
KEIKO JR: All right. What story would you like to hear? 
GUEST5: Not you. I want Mommy. 
(Keiko leaves) 
O'BRIEN: What if Daddy reads you a story tonight? Will that be okay?
I'll be right back.

[O'Brien quarters]

O'BRIEN: Keiko. It's going to be all right. I
promise. We'll work this out. 
KEIKO JR: How? 
O'BRIEN: I don't know.

First Officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise
has reached the Ligos system, and we have begun to search for the
missing Federation science team. Doctor Crusher reports no progress on
a cure for the members of the shuttle crew.

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is enjoying running his fingers through his
hair again, and puts on the jacket when the doorbell rings) 
PICARD JR: Come. 
TROI: I came to see how you're doing. 
PICARD JR: I'll have to speak to my tailor, but otherwise I'm well,
thank you. It's just so ridiculous. I can't really take myself
seriously like this. Counsellor, if Doctor Crusher can't find a cure,
if I have to stay this way, nobody's going to take me seriously, are
they? 
TROI: I would say the people that know you and have worked with you,
will be able to make the adjustment eventually. But there are some
people who would find it difficult to accept a twelve year old captain.

PICARD JR: In that case, I suppose I'll just have to wait until I grow
up again before I get another command. Which might be in ten, maybe
fifteen years. The question is what to do until then? 
TROI: You're still a Starfleet captain. I'm sure there are other
assignments you could be given in the interim. 
PICARD JR:: I've spent thirty years of my life aboard starships I'm not
about to sit behind a desk now. 
TROI: You could return to the Academy. Take another degree. Brush up on
your Latin. 
PICARD JR: And be Wesley Crusher's room mate? I will admit that
returning to the Academy does have a certain appeal, but I've spent my
life looking forward. Going to the Academy again feels like looking
backward. 
TROI: Then perhaps you could spend the time exploring another
interests. Archeology, for instance. 
PICARD JR: Leave Starfleet? 
TROI: Not permanently, just a sabbatical. You could spend a few years
crawling through caves and digging up artefacts, and still have enough
time to become the youngest admiral in Starfleet history. 
PICARD JR: It would give me a chance to take up Doctor Langford's offer
and accompany her to the ruins on Suvin Four. But to leave the
Enterprise. 
TROI: In a way, you're very lucky. You might have a chance do what most
people can only dream about. Have a second childhood without the pain
of growing up again.
