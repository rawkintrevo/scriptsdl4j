PICARD KVADA DTAN SPOCK ROMULAN DATA

[Klingon bridge]

DATA: Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify a
transmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near Galorndon
Core twelve hours ago.
K'VADA: Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a
great deal with the Romulans. It's probably just routine. 
DATA: This would not appear to be routine. I was able to trace the
source of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulan
intelligence.
PICARD: Can you access it?
DATA: It is a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero. 
PICARD: Nothing more?
DATA: No, sir.

D'TAN: Spock! I've been looking for you. 
SPOCK: I have been meeting with the Proconsul.

SPOCK: He speaks of nothing else.

D'TAN: Have you ever seen these?
(odd shapes small blocks) 
SPOCK: The syllabic nucleus of the Vulcan language. 
D'TAN: They were my toys when I was small. 
SPOCK: Your parents wanted you to learn to understand Vulcan?
D'TAN: Yes, as did their parents before them, to prepare us for the day
when we would live again with our Vulcan cousins.
ROMULAN 1: Your friends from the Federation have returned. They need to
see you immediately. I've told Pardek. He'll meet you at the cave.
