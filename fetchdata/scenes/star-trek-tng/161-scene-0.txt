PICARD RIKER SCIENTIST DATA GARIN

[Bridge]

DATA: The satellite's trajectory is continuing to
deteriorate, Captain. This orbit will put it within five hundred
kilometres of the planet surface. 
GARIN [on viewscreen]: We're predicting the atmospheric drag will bring
it down on the next orbit. 
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: Have you been able to find any explanation
for this? 
DATA: No, Doctor. It is a most unusual phenomenon. 
PICARD: Won't the moon disintegrate prior to impact? 
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: No, it has a ferrous crystalline structure
and it will be able to withstand tidal forces, Captain 
RIKER: Could we blow it into pieces? 
DATA: The total mass of the moon would remain the same, Commander, and
the impact of thousands of fragments would spread destruction over an
even wider area. 
PICARD: How long before impact? 
DATA: Twenty nine hours, sir. Projecting it somewhere on the western
continent. That
would destroy an area eight hundred kilometres in radius. 
SCIENTIST [on viewscreen]: That damage would be insignificant, Captain,
compared to the seismic repercussions massive landquakes, and tsunami. 
GARIN [on viewscreen]: The force would raise a cloud of dust around the
planet, leading to a significant temperature reduction. We could be
looking at our own ice age. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, is there any way that the Enterprise could
coax that satellite
