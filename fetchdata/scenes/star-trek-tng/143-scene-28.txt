[Starbase 515 Medical Complex]

PICARD: I hope you won't be late for your exams. 
WESLEY: I still have some time, sir. 
PICARD: Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting like some
kind of escort? 
WESLEY: Doctor Pulaski asked me to make sure you actually went inside. 
PICARD: That woman. She would. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: Yes, what is it, Ensign? 
WESLEY: I enjoyed our trip together, sir. 
PICARD: So did I.

[Bridge]

DATA: They are initiating visual contact, sir. 
RIKER: Maybe now we'll find out what they really want. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Enterprise. 
RIKER: We demand that you return our crewmember immediately. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Request denied. 
RIKER: Lower your shield! 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Request denied. 
(and he shoots Geordi with the phaser, again) 
RIKER: Stop it! What do you want? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: You think we are not smart. 
RIKER: I think you need to continue to develop. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We are smart. 
RIKER: Prove it. Return our man to us. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: You want him? 
RIKER: Yes, damn it. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Good. We want all computer information from
your ship. Now.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: We've got a man held hostage by alien forces
and all I have are no-option options. I need some input. 
PULASKI: Is Geordi all right? 
WORF: He's already been hit by multiple phaser stuns. 
PULASKI: He could need medical attention. 
WORF: Security team stands ready to take the initiative, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
DATA: Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakled
demand or not. We can either use force or not. 
RIKER: Allowing them access to our computer is a complete breech of
Starfleet security. 
WORF: Then force it must be.

(Surgical scrubs are now red. Presumably to hide
the blood.) 
SURGEON: Don't worry about a thing, Captain. We've done this a hundred
times, and we're ready when you are. 
PICARD: Just get on with it, Doctor. I've got work to do. 
SURGEON: Activate Sterile Field. Neural callipers. 
(the electronic anaesthesia is applied) 
SURGEON: This will be a secondary cardiac procedure with mid-line entry
and excision of the early model unit. I anticipate no complications, as
the patient has had positive primary results and exhibits extraordinary
physical condition. We'll all be home in time for dinner. Tissue
mitigator.
