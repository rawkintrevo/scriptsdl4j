[Observation Lounge]

K'EHLEYR: We find the ship before it reaches the
awakening point. In that case, we simply keep the crew asleep. 
PICARD: Is that feasible? 
LAFORGE: We can beam an away team onto the T'Ong and override the
cryogenic controls, sure. 
K'EHLEYR: Then we await the arrival of the Klingon ship P'rang. 
TROI: So that when the T'Ong's crew awakens, they're surrounded by
their fellow Klingons. 
RIKER: That would be ideal. 
K'EHLEYR: But there's the second possibility. That the crew of the
T'Ong has already revived. 
LAFORGE: They realise they're in Federation territory and attack the
nearest outpost. 
TROI: They could have been on a scientific voyage. 
K'EHLEYR: Klingons of that ear doing research for its own sake? 
RIKER: The point is, they may be reasonable. 
K'EHLEYR: The point is that this is beside the point. These are
Klingons, at war with us. Whatever their mission was, once they see a
Federation target, they'll attack. 
PICARD: Could the T'Ong be disabled rather than destroyed? 
LAFORGE: We could probably knock out their warp drive engines without
damaging the rest of their ship. 
K'EHLEYR: That would gain you nothing. Disable the ship, and K'Temoc
will destroy it himself. 
WORF: Klingons do not surrender. 
K'EHLEYR: If we don't reach the T'Ong before its crew wakes up, you
have no alternatives. 
PICARD: I can't not accept that. There must be some way that we can
make the Klingons listen. If we can only convince them 
DATA [OC]: Captain, we are detecting a ship, 
[Bridge]

DATA: Bearing three one-six mark four two

[Observation lounge]

DATA [OC]: Extreme sensor range. 
PICARD: Lay in intercept course. Go to yellow alert.

[Bridge]

WORF: Shields are up. 
K'EHLEYR: Better lock in phasers. This may be the only chance you get. 
CLANCEY: Intercept course laid in. 
PICARD: Hold this position. Let's see if they've spotted us.
Magnification, one hundred. Mister Data? 
DATA: Sensors show life forms aboard, but I am unable to ascertain
whether they are awake or dormant. However, the vessel's propulsion
systems are inactive, so I would hypothesize that the crew is asleep. 
(So they get shot at) 
DATA: However, I could be in error. 
WORF: Shields holding. 
RIKER: They've cloaked themselves. 
K'EHLEYR: Well, Captain you've had your chance. 
(a few minutes later, La Forge enters) 
LAFORGE: Transferring Engineering to the Bridge. 
PICARD: Can you find them? 
LAFORGE: I think so. Those old shields weren't particularly efficient
at blocking gamma ray output. If I can tune the sensors to a particular
band of. There. Got them. Transferring coordinates to helm. 
PICARD: Intercept. Warp two. 
CLANCEY: Warp two, sir. 
K'EHLEYR: Captain let them die like Klingons, in battle. They deserve
that much. 
WORF: Captain. I have another option.

Captain's log, stardate 42901.3. Despite their
cloaking shields, we have located the Klingon vessel, T'Ong. In an
effort to avoid further confrontation, we're about to implement the
option presented by Lieutenant Worf. 
[Bridge]

DATA: The T'Ong has changed course to three two
mark eight one. Increasing to warp three. 
RIKER: Standard evasive manoeuvre. 
PICARD: Helm, stay with them. 
CLANCEY: Yes, sir. 
DATA: The T'Ong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three.
They are accelerating to warp five. 
RIKER: They're going to make a break for it. 
PICARD: Overtake, warp eight. 
CLANCEY: Aye. 
PICARD: Now, put us right in their path and come to a full stop. Full
power to shields. 
TACTICAL: Full power, sir. 
PICARD: Well, we've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick it
up. 
DATA: They are slowing to impulse, sir. 
(The ship appears and fires) 
TACTICAL: Phaser hit on forward shields. Firming up now. No damage. 
RIKER: I guess we've piqued their interest now. 
PICARD: Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in the
face. Ready, Lieutenant? WORF: Open hailing frequencies. 
TACTICAL: Open, sir. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What? What is this? 
(Worf and K'Ehleyr are in Klingon uniforms, sitting where Picard and
Riker should be) 
WORF: Captain K'Temoc, have you lost your mind? Halt your vessel and
drop your shields. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What treachery is this? By whose authority? 
WORF: I am Worf, commanding the Enterprise. And it is you who have
committed an act of treason by firing upon this ship. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have standing orders to fire on all
Federation ships! 
WORF: You fool! Did it not occur to you that the war would be over by
now? 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have no proof of that. 
WORF: Trust your eyes. Or is your brain still stuck in its long
slumber? 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: How do I know this is not a Federation trick?
How can I be sure? 
WORF: Captain, as you are new to this century, I have tried to be
patient. But I will tolerate no further insubordination. Drop your
shields. Immediately. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: And if I refuse? 
WORF: Then die in ignorance. I can waste no more time on you. Phasers
to full power. 
TACTICAL: Aye, sir. Phasers ready. Target locked. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: You dare not destroy us. We are on a crucial
mission by order of the Klingon High Command. 
WORF: Has the T'Ong dropped its shields? 
TACTICAL: No, sir. 
WORF: Very well. Fire all phasers. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Wait! Lower the shields. I yield command of
the T'Ong to you, Captain Worf. Long live the Klingon Empire. 
WORF: A wise decision, Captain. Commander K'Ehleyr will board your ship
and take command. The Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon arrive and
escort you home. And, Captain 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Yes? 
WORF: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. 
(Transmission ends. Picard and Riker come out of the Ready room) 
WORF: I return command of the ship to you, Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine first
command. Well done. 
RIKER: How did you like command? 
WORF: Comfortable chair. 
K'EHLEYR: And you wore it well.
