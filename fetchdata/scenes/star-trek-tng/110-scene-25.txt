[Ferengi Science Lab]

BOK: You will injure yourself as you once injured
me.

[Picard's quarters]

VOICES [OC]: Sir! 
(Picard opens his eyes, and he sees the ghost of the Stargazer's bridge
and her crew. He is reliving the past) 
PICARD: Damage report! 
VOICE [OC]: Fusion generator under surge control, sir! Power systems
failing! 
PICARD: Sensor beam bearing on hostile ship! 
VOICE [OC]: Seven mark nineteen, sir! 
VOICE [OC]: Phasers, sir? Sir? 
PICARD: Ready phasers, and lock! Stand by on warp nine. Heading seven,
seven mark twenty. Engage. 
PICARD: Steady. Now, reverse and stop! Phasers fire, torpedoes away!
Fire. Fire.

[Ready Room]

DATA: By comparing the Stargazer's main computer
log with Captain Picard's personal log, I have found checksum
discrepancies, sir. 
RIKER: What does that mean? 
DATA: All information is time-coded by entry, and the bits when totaled
produce an aggregate amount which 
RIKER: I don't want a computer science lesson, Data. Bottom line. 
DATA: One of these two logs is a forgery, sir. 
LAFORGE: Correction. The log just found aboard the Stargazer is a
forgery. 
DATA: As I said, that is one of them, is it not? 
(Picard enters) 
LAFORGE: Captain. You're looking better, sir. 
PICARD: A little sleep, thanks to the good Doctor, works wonders. What
report on the logs? 
DATA: Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with your personal log was clever. 
LAFORGE: But a bit clumsy. It's definitely a fabrication, sir. 
(Crusher enters) 
CRUSHER: Number One, I'd like you to take a look at this brain scan
graph. What are you doing here? 
PICARD: I thought I was Captain of this starship. 
CRUSHER: Of course you are, but I 
PICARD: Thank you for the confirmation, Doctor. But now, except for
Riker, I would like you all to return to your stations. Is that clear? 
DATA: Sir. 
(Data and Geordi leave) 
PICARD: You too, Doctor. I have business with the Commander. 
CRUSHER: Under protest, Captain. 
(Crusher leaves) 
RIKER: You have orders for me, sir? 
PICARD: Release the Stargazer from the tractor beam, Number One. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: The tractor beam. 
RIKER: Sir, are you abandoning? 
PICARD: No, but her inertia will carry the Stargazer along with us. Or
did you sleep through the Academy lecture on conservation of tractor
beam power? 
RIKER: No, sir. I'll release her, of course.

(The output from the forehead devices is on a wall
display) 
CRUSHER: Obviously, there's some thought process disorder, but I can't
find a physical reason for it. Anything?
TROI: I'm puzzled too. I keep sensing random thoughts but two sets of
them. As if they were his, but intermixed other thoughts which are also
his. 
(Wesley enters) 
CRUSHER: I'm busy at the moment, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I know, Mom, but this is important. When I went back to the
main sensors in Engineering to try some more sensitivity experiments 
TROI: Does this have something to do with Captain Picard? 
WESLEY: Yes, ma'am, if this is what you're talking about here. I don't
know much about brain scans but I glanced at these when you were
studying them, and I noticed that these patterns are the same as those
picked up from the low-intensity transmissions from the Ferengi ship. I
went back and checked, and they're exactly the same. 
TROI: What kind of transmissions? 
WESLEY: I don't know. Engineering has nothing like it on record. 
TROI: Let's get to the Captain. 
CRUSHER: No, they might be affecting the Captain. To Riker. 
(Crusher and Troi leave) 
WESLEY: You're welcome, ladies. Adults.

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: The captain, Commander? 
RIKER: Resting in his quarters after ordering both of you to your duty
stations. 
TROI: There have been some, did he say low intensity? Some unusual low
intensity transmissions from the Ferengi vessel. 
RIKER: Did who say? 
CRUSHER: My son. Transmissions which exactly match certain anomalies
found in the Captain's brain scans. Something over there is affecting
the Captain's thought patterns. 
RIKER: Computer, give me a location on Captain Picard. 
COMPUTER: Captain Picard is in Transporter room three. 
RIKER: What? Computer, emergency order to Transporter room three. 
COMPUTER: New information. Captain Picard is no longer aboard the
Enterprise.
