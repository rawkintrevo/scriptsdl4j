TIMICIN LWAXANA
manoeuvred nightcap come son thing exist extremely died mean

[Turbolift]

LWAXANA: So, knowing that my daughter's starship
would be passing fairly close to Betazed again, I manoeuvred a ride and
here I am. Deck eight. 
TIMICIN: I also have a grown daughter. She has a small son of her own. 
LWAXANA: Then you're married. 
TIMICIN: My wife died quite some years ago.

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: You know, one thing I don't understand. If
your people have known for generations that their sun is dying, why not
simply evacuate the planet? 
TIMICIN: It is our home. It defines who we are as a people. If Kaelon
Two ceases to exist, so do we. 
LWAXANA: Then you definitely should fix it. 
TIMICIN: With the Federation's help, I hope we will. 
LWAXANA: And the Federation will be pleased to offer whatever help it
can. 
(at Lwaxana's door) 
LWAXANA: Would you come in for a nightcap? 
TIMICIN: That's extremely kind of you, but 
LWAXANA: My valet sleeps elsewhere. 
TIMICIN: You are delightful. You make me laugh. I mean, I don't mean
your invitation makes me laugh. I mean I took it quite seriously. I
mean 
LWAXANA: Just say yes. I'll make you laugh some more. 
TIMICIN: I wish I could. But I must say no. Goodnight, Lwaxana.
