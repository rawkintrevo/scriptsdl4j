LAFORGE WORF PICARD CHIEF SCOTT DATA

[Jenolen]

LAFORGE: We're using the Jenolen to hold open the
hatch that you came through, but our shields aren't going to hold out
much longer. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Understood. Ensign, set a course.

[Jenolen]

SCOTT: The plasma intercooler's gone. The engines
are overheating. 
LAFORGE: I've lost helm control. La Forge to Enterprise. Captain, we're
not going to be able to move this ship out of the way when you get
here. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: You're going to have to destroy it in
order to escape. 
PICARD: How much longer before we reach them? 
DATA: With impulse engines operating at sixty percent power, it will
take one minute and forty seconds. 
PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room three. Prepare to beam two from the
Jenolen as soon as we're within range. 
[Jenolen]

SCOTT: It's coming apart, Lad. I can't do anything
else.

[Bridge]

WORF: Photon torpedoes armed and ready, sir. 
DATA: We are within transporter range. 
PICARD: Bridge to Transporter room. Energise. 
CHIEF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Fire torpedoes. 
(KaBOOM! And the spacedoors start to close. Enterprise gracefully
swoops through the remaining gap and the doors clang shut behind them)

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: There now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
