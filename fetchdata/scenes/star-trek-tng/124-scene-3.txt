RIKER: Captain, we've received communication from
the freighter Lalo, as well as from a farming colony on Coltar Four.
Both described the same time distortion. The Captain of the Lalo
described it a hiccup. 
PICARD: Hiccup? 
DATA: Actually sir, that may be an incorrect analogy. 
PICARD: How so, Data? 
DATA: A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis.
accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we were to continue this analogy to
a body function, what occurred would be best represented by a 
PICARD: That's enough, Data. Have you been able to learn more specifics
about the Manheim project? 
DATA: All I have found sir, is what you already know. Manheim was
concentrating on time gravity experiments when he left. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we've reached the coordinates specified. There's
nothing here. 
WORF: I'm receiving new coordinates. It's a relay signal. Same source
as the first one. 
LAFORGE: What are they, Worf? 
WORF: Six six four point eight by one three two three point seven by
four nine four nine point nine. 
LAFORGE: Very remote area, sir. It's in the middle of the Vandor
system, a binary star system. Main star's a B class giant, the
companion star's a pulsar. 
PICARD: Set course for the new coordinates, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Why is he making it this difficult to find him? 
PICARD: Hopefully he'll tell us, Number One. 
(Later) 
LAFORGE: We have reached the coordinates, Captain. 
DATA: Sensors indicate it is Vandor Four, a planetoid in elliptical
orbit around the binary system. 
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Give me a visual. 
WORF: Viewscreen on. There's a small forcefield on the planet. Latitude
twenty degrees, nine minutes north. Longitude forty degrees, two
minutes east of the present terminator. 
PICARD: Penetrable? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: This is Captain. This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise
responding to your signal for help. 
GUEST5 [OC]: Enterprise, thank you for hearing us. Where are you? 
PICARD: We're in orbit around Vandor now. 
GUEST5 [OC]: Then you can help me. I don't know what to do. It's only
the two of us left. He's having convulsions. Please. 
PICARD: Can you lock on to her coordinates? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. The forcefield is preventing any kind of contact
other than audio. 
PICARD: There is a force field at your location. 
GUEST5 [OC]: Yes. I know. 
PICARD: Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. Now, you must
find some way to shut it down. 
GUEST5 [OC]: I'll try. 
WORF: Force field is off. 
PICARD: Good. Lock onto their coordinates. Beam them up directly to
Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, prepare for a Medical Emergency. Two to beam
directly up to Sickbay. 
CRUSHER [OC]: We'll be ready, Captain. 
PICARD: That's where I'll be. Number One. Mister Data.
