DATA: Sensors are having difficulty penetrating the
interior. However, the radiated output suggests a coherent system of
energy storage and utilisation. 
RIKER: Then it was constructed by someone? 
DATA: It is a possibility. However, the sensor data gathered thus far
suggests a naturally occurring phenomenon with biological properties. 
PICARD: A life form. 
DATA: Yes, Captain. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, begin compiling readings for transmission to
Starfleet Headquarters. Mister Data, prepare to launch three level-five
probes. Ensign, aft thrusters. Standard observation posture. 
DATA: Level-five probe sequence ready for launch, Commander. On your
mark. 
(Troi enters) 
RIKER: Stand by, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir. PICARD: What would it be like, Counsellor? No ship, no
bulky spacesuit. Just to live between the stars, have the entire galaxy
as a home. 
(green energy sweeps out from the creature to the Enterprise) 
WORF: Captain, we are being probed. Recommend we raise shields. 
PICARD: Negative, Mister Worf. If we are curious about it, it has a
perfect right to be curious about us. 
DATA: Change in readings, sir. The life form has increased its energy
output by fifty percent. 
WORF: It is moving toward us. 
PICARD: Reverse course, Ensign, three hundred kph. 
RAGER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Easy, we don't want to alarm or provoke it. 
(harsher green energy crackles against the ship) 
DATA: We are caught in an energy damping field, sir. 
PICARD: Raise shields. 
WORF: No effect, Captain. 
PICARD: Reverse power, full impulse. 
RAGER: Impulse engines at full power. 
DATA: No change in position. 
RIKER: Red alert! 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to initiate warp drive.

LAFORGE: Sorry, Captain. There's too much
interference to form a warp field.

COMPUTER: Warning. Radiation levels at sixty five
millirads per minute and rising. 
RIKER: Riker to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Go ahead, Commander. 
RIKER: All decks prepare for radiation protocol. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Acknowledged. Crusher out. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Radiation levels at three hundred millirads per
minute and rising. Lethal exposure in one minute. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, ready phasers. Minimum power. 
WORF: Ready. 
PICARD: Fire. 
DATA: Radiation levels dropping back to normal, Captain. Energy
patterns are breaking down, sir. The radiation signature is no longer
stable. 
(the once-colourful alien goes dark) 
DATA: Energy output is negligible, sir. Radiation patterns no longer
coherent. I believe it is dead, sir. 
PICARD: We're out here to explore, to make contact with other life
forms, to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere. And
absolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done. 
TROI: Captain, everything you did was consistent with established
Starfleet procedures. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. 
DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the
life form. 
PICARD: Elaborate, Data. 
DATA: There is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in the
centre of its body. 
PICARD: Then, perhaps it's still alive.
