TROI BRENNA WORF DANILO PICARD RIKER PULASKI GRANGER DATA

[Cargo hold]

WORF: You sent for me? 
DANILO: Ah, yes, yes. Now, we're brewing poteen, but we need to find a
way to heat it without this bloody ship firing bloody lightning bolts
at us. 
WORF: You can obtain spirituous liquours from the food dispensers. 
DANILO: Oh, no, no, no. It's not that synthehol bilge that O'Brien
offered me, is it? 
WORF: No, if you wish, it can be real alcohol. 
DANILO: Good. 
WORF: With all of the deleterious effects intact. 
DANILO: As it should be. You see, lad, every moment of pleasure in life
has to be purchased by an equal moment of pain. Whiskey. 
(a glass appears, and Danilo samples it) 
DANILO: Terrible. It's got no bite. 
WORF: Chech'tluth. 
(A Klingon mug, with steam coming off it. The top Danilo's head does a
somersault) 
DANILO: Now that's what I call a wee drop of the creature. 
BRENNA: Father! 
DANILO: Remember what I said about the moment of pain? Well, tis about
to begin. Hello, my darling. 
BRENNA: Oh, my darling, is it? I might have known! Are you drunk yet,
or can you talk with Doctor Pulaski about the children? 
DANILO: What about them? 
BRENNA: She wants to send them to school with the ship's children. 
DANILO: What do you think? 
BRENNA: I think it's a good idea. So go handle it! (to the other men)
I'm sure there's something you can be doing with your time. (to Worf)
And as for you. 
WORF: What? 
BRENNA: Why did you have to tell them that this magic wall can give
them more than meat and potatoes? Now we'll never get a lick of work
out of them. 
WORF: Madam, have you considered a career in security? 
BRENNA: If it's anything like babysitting, I'm an authority. 
(The women laugh) 
Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching the
class M planet where we hope to find the other colonists. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Signal from the planet, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. This is Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise,
representing the United Federation of Planets. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: This is wonderful. Welcome, Captain. I'm
Wilson Granger, Prime Minister of Mariposa. 
DATA: No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Not quite a descendant. We feared Earth had
suffered some catastrophe when no one came back to check on us. 
PICARD: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. But
despite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager to
renew ties. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Splendid. Please, come down, and allow us to
extend our hospitality to you and your crew. 
PICARD: Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. 
TROI: I would urge caution. 
RIKER: Caution? What's wrong? 
TROI: He's hiding something. 
RIKER: We'll check it out. Mister Worf. Doctor Pulaski, join us in
Transporter room three for an away detail.

[Reception]

(a very modern looking building, and clothing
style) 
GRANGER 2: Welcome to Mariposa. I'm Victor Granger, Minister of Health.

RIKER: Commander William Riker, Doctor Pulaski, Lieutenant Worf. 
GRANGER 2: A pleasure. I'll escort you to the Prime Minister. This way
please. 
RIKER: Twin brothers? 
GRANGER 2: Your arrival really is serendipitous. 
PULASKI: Oh, how so? 
GRANGER 2: Well, perhaps I'll let the Prime Minister to explain that. 
(Three identical women are standing by a desk) 
RIKER: Triplets? Worf, there is something damn odd down here. 
(a fourth woman walks by) 
WORF: Quadruplets.
