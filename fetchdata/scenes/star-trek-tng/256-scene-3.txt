[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, I am receiving a transmission from
Admiral Chekote at Starbase two twenty seven. 
RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Sir. 
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: (not obviously a Native American) I read your
report, Commander. My condolences to you and your crew. Captain
Picard's death is a loss to the entire Federation. I see that you've
asked to postpone your mission to the Argus sector. For what reason? 
RIKER: I have a request, sir. I would like to conduct an investigation
into Captain Picard's death. 
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: The Dessican authorities have jurisdiction in
this case, Commander. 
RIKER: I know that, sir. Frankly, I don't have much confidence in the
authorities on Dessica Two. There's every reason to believe that
they're corrupt. 
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: I suspect you're right. The question remains, are
you the one to pursue this? 
RIKER: The Captain's death hit me pretty hard, and I may not be
completely objective, but there is no one who is more determined. I
won't rest until I find out who's responsible. 
CHEKOTE [on monitor]: All right, Commander. I'm officially placing the
Enterprise on detached duty. Your mission is at your discretion. Good
luck. 
RIKER: Thank you, sir.
