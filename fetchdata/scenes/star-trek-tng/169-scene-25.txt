TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD HOLOTROI CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Report. 
WORF: Sir, our velocity increased to warp seven point two five. 
DATA: Compensating, sir. 
WORF: Confirmed. Velocity now warp seven. 
PICARD: Maintain that. What the hell happened? 
DATA: The matter-antimatter injectors locked for a split second. I am
not certain why, sir. They appear to be working properly now. 
PICARD: Picard to La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. 
PICARD: Commander, any explanation for this injector problem? 

[Holodeck - Glade]

LAFORGE: Well, I'm not in Engineering, sir. I'm in
holodeck two. 
PICARD [OC]: Another malfunction? 
LAFORGE: Not exactly, but I'll return to Engineering immediately, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Yes, I should say you should, Commander.
Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, sir? 
PICARD: It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay 
[Holodeck - Glade]

PICARD [OC]: On this latest incident. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to very much, Captain. La Forge out. We need to find
Barclay now. 
HOLO-TROI: Cast aside your masks and let me slip into your minds. 
TROI: Muzzle it. 
(they walk on and find Reg sleeping in the lap of Gainsborough Beverly)

CRUSHER: Shh!
