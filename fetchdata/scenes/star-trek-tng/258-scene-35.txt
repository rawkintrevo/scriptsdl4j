[Holodeck]

(Data is wired up) 
LAFORGE: I think we're ready, Captain. The link is active. The holodeck
has been calibrated to Data's neural net. 
(the security guard leaves) 
PICARD: Ready, Mister Data? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Normally, I would wish you pleasant dreams, but in this case,
bad dreams would be more helpful. 
DATA: I understand, sir. Initiating dream programme. Stand by. 
[Holodeck - corridor]

PICARD: Let's be very observant. Even the most
insignificant image could be a very important symbol. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
(Data walks slowly round the corner)
PICARD: Here he comes. 
DATA: Hello. 
PICARD: Can we speak to Data directly or would that wake him up? 
LAFORGE: He should be perceiving us as just another part of his dream.
Anything we say to him will be taken in that context. 
PICARD: You know, that sounds like a telephone ringer, but I don't see
a receiver. 
[Ten Forward]

(Crusher drinking Riker's brain, the Troi cake, all
as before) 
DATA: Cake? 
PICARD: Oh. Er, thank you. Look at that. Her right shoulder. That is
the same place that Data stabbed her. 
LAFORGE: In his waking dream he said that there was a mouth on her
shoulder. 
PICARD: They're both symbols of consumption. Mouth, food. Mister Data,
what kind of cake is this? 
DATA: It is cellular peptide cake. 
WORF: With mint frosting. 
LAFORGE: Cellular peptides. That's exactly what the creatures are
extracting. 
RIKER: Will someone answer that damn ringing! Captain, the ringing is
getting worse. 
PICARD: What could the ringing symbolise? A bell? Sound? An
old-fashioned way of communicating? 
CRUSHER: Do you want some? It's delicious. 
RIKER: Will somebody please get that! 
(Geordi answers the phone in Data's tummy) 
LAFORGE: Yes? It's for you. 
PICARD: Picard. 
FREUD [OC]: Kill them. 
PICARD: Kill who? 
FREUD [OC]: Kill them, before it is too late. 
PICARD: Who is this?

[Holodeck - Freud's office]

FREUD: I am Doctor Sigmund Freud. 
LAFORGE: How does he fit into all this? 
FREUD: If I were to interpret my own appearance in this dream, I would
say I am the symbolic representation of Data's unconscious mind trying
to warn him about the dangers he perceives around him. 
PICARD: You mean the interphasic organisms. 
FREUD: Of course. 
PICARD: Tell me, Doctor, how do we kill them? 
(telephone) 
FREUD: Answer it. Nien, nien, nien. Do not be so literal. When I say
answer it, I mean respond to it, to them. 
(the workmen enter) 
WORKMAN: Be quiet! 
(the workman shoots Freud then starts hacking at the plasma conduit) 
PICARD: What do they represent? 
LAFORGE: I don't know, but I do recognise that junction they're working
on. It's the plasma conduit we installed with the new warp core. 
PICARD: Respond? Respond to them? What does that mean? 
LAFORGE: What is it that you're doing? 
WORKMAN: Go away. Leave us alone. 
PICARD: Who are you? 
WORKMAN: We are your enemies. 
DATA: Stop. You must not hurt my friends. 
(Data emits the high-pitched sound) 
WORKMAN: Be quiet! 
PICARD: Data, the shrieking noise you made. It causes them pain. 
(Data repeats the sound) 
WORKMAN: Be quiet. 
(the workmen collapse) 
DATA: I believe I understand.

[Holodeck]

DATA: Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Data. 
DATA: You must adjust my positronic subprocessor to emit an interphasic
pulse. 
PICARD: Data, what's going on? 
DATA: The workmen in my dreams represent the organisms which are trying
to demolish the ship. The incessant ringing of the telephone, Freud's
cautions at the other end, were warnings of the dangers around us. 
PICARD: What about the shrieking noises that you made? 
DATA: My positronic subprocessor detected high frequency interphasic
signatures from the organisms, which were symbolically represented in
my dreams by a high shriek. 
PICARD: When you made those noises, the workmen reacted in pain. 
DATA: That is why I have asked Geordi to adjust my subprocessor. If I
can produce a high frequency interphasic pulse, it may have a similar
effect on the creatures. 
LAFORGE: We're ready. 
PICARD: Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're going to be sweeping the ship
with a high frequency IP pulse. Will you monitor the creatures for any
response? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Understood. 
(the noise goes beyond our hearing)
