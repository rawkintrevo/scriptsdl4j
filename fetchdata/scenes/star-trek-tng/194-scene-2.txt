(but he's still tapping at the PADD when he walks
in and turns the lights down a little. Then he picks up the Horga'hn
sitting on a table.)
VASH: Bring back any memories? 
PICARD: Vash. How did you get in here? 
VASH: I came in through the window. 
(they kiss)

[Picard's quarters]

(guess what happened between the kiss and
breakfast) 
PICARD: I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council. You
are a member, aren't you? 
VASH: More or less. 
PICARD: Why did you come to Tagus Three? 
VASH: To see you, of course. 
PICARD: Is that the only reason? 
VASH: Isn't it enough? 
PICARD: I wish I could believe you. 
VASH: I really have missed you, Jean-Luc. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Excuse me. 
(he goes to the door) 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry I'm late. Oh. Excuse me. I didn't realise you had
company. 
PICARD: That's all right. Er, allow me to introduce you. This is
Beverly, Doctor Beverly, Doctor Beverly Crusher. This is Vash. She's a
friend of mine from the Archaeology Council. 
CRUSHER: I didn't mean to interrupt. The Captain and I often share
morning tea together. 
VASH: Yes, I know. Jean-Luc has told me all about you. 
CRUSHER: Really? When was that? 
VASH: On Risa, where we met. 
CRUSHER: I see. That must have been during your vacation last year. 
PICARD: No. Yes. Yes. 
CRUSHER: Well, I'm surprised he never mentioned you. 
VASH: So am I. Doctor, are you busy? 
CRUSHER: Not at the moment. 
VASH: I was wondering, I would love to see some more of this marvellous
ship. 
CRUSHER: I would be delighted to show it to you. 
PICARD: I, er 
CRUSHER: That is, if it's all right with you, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: Of course. 
VASH: Don't worry, I promise to behave myself.
