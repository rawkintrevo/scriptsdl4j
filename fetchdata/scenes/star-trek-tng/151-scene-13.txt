[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: Captain, may I speak with you? 
PICARD: It's my pleasure, Number One. 
RIKER: We've been observing the planet very carefully for three hours.
We've seen nothing. I have the feeling you're waiting for something to
happen. 
PICARD: Your Captain is acting on an assumption, Will, and I'm not sure
what the result will be, or even that my assumption is correct. We
found two people alive in a house on a devastated planet. But there was
only one survivor of the war on Rana Four.

[Bridge]

WORF: Why is it we maintain watch on a planet that
is now totally dead? 
LAFORGE: Bridge to Captain Picard. You had better come see this. 
(Picard and Riker enter) 
LAFORGE: Captain. Commander. The house is back. Trees, grass,
everything. Happened right in front of us. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, do you see any survivors? 
WORF: I detect two life forms inside the house. It appears Kevin and
Rishon were not destroyed. 
PICARD: Helm, take us within transporter range. We're going to beam
them aboard directly onto the Bridge. 
DATA: But, Captain, will they not protest? 
PICARD: Let them. 
(Kevin and Rishon appear) 
PICARD: My apologies if I interrupted a waltz. 
GUEST0: Why have you brought us here against our will? 
PICARD: I want to end the suffering of one of my crewmembers. 
GUEST0: I don't understand. 
PICARD: Kevin does. He's the cause. At first I couldn't understand why
your house survived the holocaust when the others hadn't.
Then it occurred to me. It had been destroyed. That dwelling, where you
served me tea, where you danced your waltzes, is a reproduction. Real
to the touch but capable of being created, destroyed, and created. All
on a whim. 
GUEST0: You're joking with us, Captain. Can't you see this is hurting
my husband? 
GUEST1: Rishon. Hear what he has to say. 
PICARD: More than anything else, you wanted the Enterprise away from
Rana, because the house, the plot of land, your very existence, were
incongruities that you were not prepared to explain. The warship,
another recreation, tried to chase us away twice, and failed. But when
I came to your house the second time, I provided you with the only
condition that would make the Enterprise leave. Your deaths. You did
your best to satisfy that condition. 
GUEST1: I'm deeply sorry about the woman. I will help her. But I must
know what you intend to do with me afterwards. 
PICARD: You'll be taken to the nearest starbase and held responsible
for the attack on the Enterprise, and possibly the deaths of eleven
thousand people. 
GUEST0: No. He never killed anyone. 
GUEST1: The destruction of the planet happened just as I told you. 
PICARD: But you haven't told us the whole story. How it ended. The part
about Rishon. 
GUEST0: What is he saying? 
PICARD: Rishon, I can touch you. I can hear your voice, I can smell
your perfume. In every respect you are a real person with your own mind
and beliefs, but you do not exist. You died along with the others,
defending the colony. He recreated you, just as he recreated the house.

(Rishon vanishes) 
PICARD: You are the only living thing that really exists on Rana. And
though you look human, you're not. 
(Kevin turns briefly into a creature of light, then disappears) 
LAFORGE: He's in the turbolift. 
PICARD: Let him go. 
WORF: Captain, he is dangerous! 
PICARD: So dangerous, Mister Worf, that he could have destroyed us in
an instant had he wished. Track him. Alert the crew to keep clear of
hm. I want him to understand we mean him no harm 
RIKER: Will he return to the planet? 
PICARD: If he is the creature of conscience I believe him to be, he has
someone to help first.
