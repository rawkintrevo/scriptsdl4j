RIKER: Welcome aboard. 
MORIARTY: May I present Regina, the Countess Bartholomew. 
RIKER: Countess. 
COUNTESS: Commander. 
RIKER: You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities given the
circumstances. 
MORIARTY: Ah, yes. I expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your
vessel. 
RIKER: Please. 
MORIARTY: I'm afraid that won't be possible just yet. 
RIKER: We had an agreement. 
MORIARTY: And I intend to honour it. I have no desire to see your
vessel destroyed. Just give me one of your shuttlecraft, and allow us
to leave in peace. 
RIKER: We don't have time for this. You release the command codes and
we'll talk. 
MORIARTY: I will not release your vessel until I am looking at it
through a shuttlecraft window.

[Shuttlebay]

RIKER: Everything has been programmed to operate on
voice command. you just tell the computer where you want to go. 
MORIARTY: Excellent. 
RIKER: I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabited
planet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is your
business. 
MORIARTY: Please tell your Captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I
do wish I could see his face when he realises where he's been the last
several hours. 
RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger. 
MORIARTY: Don't worry, Commander. You'll soon have control of your
ship. 
COUNTESS: Goodbye, Commander. Thank you for everything. 
MORIARTY: Computer, prepare to depart. 
RIKER: Open shuttlebay doors.
