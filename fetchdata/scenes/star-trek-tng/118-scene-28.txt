PICARD HARRY WESLEY CUSTODIAN RASHELLA CRUSHER KATIE

[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: No. That doesn't fit the pattern. Give me
a list of the appropriate medical literature from the twenty-second
century. There's not enough time! 
PICARD: Is there anything I can do? 
CRUSHER: You just did, Jean-Luc. Now I have to get back to work.

[Wesley's room]

(That night, Wesley sneaks out of bed) 
WESLEY: Custodian's room.

[Custodian room]

WESLEY: Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher. 
CUSTODIAN: Proceed, Wesley. 
WESLEY: Show me where the Enterprise children are in relation to this
room. Thank you. Goodnight. 
CUSTODIAN: Good night, Wesley. 
[Katie's room]

(Katie is startled awake by a hand on her arm) 
WESLEY: I think I know a way to get us home. I need your help.

Chief Medical Officer's log, stardate 41512.9. I've
begun to suspect that whatever is killing the Aldeans is related to a
danger faced by Earth in the twenty first century. Can it be that
Aldea's ozone layer has been weakened? 
[Wesley's room]

KATIE: Why will not talking or eating make them
send us home? 
WESLEY: It's called passive resistance. We don't do what they want us
to do and then they won't want us. 
KATIE: Will they get mad at us? 
WESLEY: They won't hurt us. 
HARRY: But, Wes, I do kind of like them. 
WESLEY: So do I, but I don't want to stay here forever. Do you? 
HARRY: No, but I like working with the wood. 
WESLEY: Harry, we all have to be in this together or it's not going to
work. 
HARRY: Okay. I'll do it. 
RASHELLA: What are you all doing here together? 
(She reaches for Alexandria, but Wesley picks her up instead) 
RASHELLA: What is going on here?
