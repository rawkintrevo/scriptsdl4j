WESLEY: Now entering the Beta Agni system, sir. 
RIKER: Take us to half impulse, Mister Crusher. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to bridge. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: A class two probe has been loaded with the
hytritium compound and is ready to launch. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: Now approaching Beta Agni Two, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mister Data, scan. My
apologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water. 
WORF: Scanning. Tricyanate contamination confirmed. Levels approaching
forty two parts per million. 
RIKER: Area affected? 
WORF: Thirty square kilometres. 
PICARD: Any indication of the source? 
WORF: Highest concentration eight kilometres west of the colony. 
RIKER: Adjust target coordinates. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to bridge. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: According to these figures, the eighty one
kilos 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Of hytritium should be enough to
neutralise the contamination. 
WESLEY: Now approaching target coordinates. 
PICARD: Launch probe.
WORF: Probe on target. Hytritium entering water table. Disbursement
slightly faster than expected. Sir, something unusual. 
PICARD: Specify. 
WORF: I'm getting concentrated tricyanate readings of seventy grams per
cubic centimetre at the source coordinates. Much higher than would
normally occur. 
PICARD: Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two. 
COMPUTER: No significant geological activity has been recorded on Beta
Agni Two since the settlement of the Federation colony. 
PICARD: Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down and
have a closer look. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. Doctor Crusher, join me in Transporter room three. 
CRUSHER [OC]: On my way. 
RIKER: Mister Worf?
