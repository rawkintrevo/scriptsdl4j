WORF: Commander, sensors are picking up an
electromagnetic disturbance approaching the Captain's position. 
RIKER: Analysis? 
WORF: A variable induction field. Possibly a life form. 
RIKER: How close is it to the Captain? 
WORF: The field is erratic, appearing and disappearing, but it appears
to be moving toward him. 
RIKER: Attacking?

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
RIKER [OC]: How close are we on that transporter? 
LAFORGE: Two hours, maybe three. 
RIKER [OC]: I want the Captain out of there now. 
LAFORGE: That's not very likely, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I don't want to hear that, Commander. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lefler, what's the resonance frequency? 
LEFLER: Point three four over standard. 
LAFORGE: I want a resolution of point five three at the very least.
Commander, I'll need about two more minutes. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: But there's a good chance this isn't
going to work. 
WORF: If it fails 
RIKER: I know. We will have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But it's
a chance we have to take. 
WORF: Agreed. 
RIKER: La Forge. Proceed. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We're on it. La Forge out. 
RIKER: Riker to transporter room one.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: O'Brien here, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: Stand by, Mister O'Brien.

(a big something appears and disappears near them) 
DATHON: Mirab, his sails unfurled? 
PICARD: Come on. 
DATHON: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
(then the creature is behind them, and vanishes again) 
DATHON: Shaka, when the walls fell. 
PICARD: Shaka. You said that before. When I couldn't build a fire. Is
that a failure? An inability to do something? 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad 
PICARD: At Tanagra. I remember the words but I don't understand.
