TROI LAFORGE WORF ALEXANDER LWAXANA COMPUTER ERKO DATA CAMPIO

[Bridge]

(working at the science station) 
LAFORGE: Well, it looks like the only alloy common to both the
replicator and the stabiliser is nitrium. Computer, analyze the nitrium
content of both the affected stabiliser and replicator. 
COMPUTER: There is no nitrium present in the affected stabiliser or
replicator. 
DATA: There is none present in the residue, either. 
LAFORGE: According to the mass spectrometer, the elements in the
residue have been broken down into simpler molecular structures. 
DATA: That would suggest the nitrium has been organically metabolised. 
LAFORGE: Maybe that's it, Data. If a living organism ingested the
nitrium. 
DATA: This residue would be the waste left behind. 
LAFORGE: If that's true, if something's eating away at the nitrium on
the ship. That means the dilithium chamber is vulnerable, as well as
the power transfer conduits. We'd better get to Engineering.

[Worf's quarters]

ALEXANDER: Ha! Ha! 
WORF: Eat, son. 
ALEXANDER: Ha! 
WORF: What are you doing? What is that noise? 
ALEXANDER: Ha! It's my laughing hour. Ha! Ha! 
WORF: That is enough, please. It is your dinner hour. Eat. 
ALEXANDER: Ha! I promised to meet Mrs. Troi for another lesson in happy
wisdom. Ha! 
WORF: Will you stop doing that, please? Alexander, eat your food.
Wisdom will wait, I assure you. 
ALEXANDER: I promised. Should I break my promise, Father? 
WORF: A Klingon ever breaks his word. 
WORF: Where are you going? 
ALEXANDER: You said no Klingon ever breaks his word. 
WORF: I did not mean now. Now just sit down and eat. 
ALEXANDER: I don't understand, Father. You're confusing me. 
WORF: Understand later. Just eat. 
ALEXANDER: Father? The higher, the fewer. 
(and Alexander leaves) 

[Lwaxana's quarters]

CAMPIO: I don't wish to be authoritative, my dear,
but Master Erko says that now is our proper time for discussion of
certain details. 
LWAXANA: Well, I certainly don't wish to be considered anti-Erko, dear,
but I did promise Alexander one more holodeck trip. Come along, my
little love. 
CAMPIO: Surely there'll be other occasions for you to spend time with
the boy. 
LWAXANA: My goodness, Campio. You and I are going to have the rest of
our lives. I'll tell you what. I'll be back here with you in one hour
exactly, all right? 
ERKO: Minister, the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar.

(Troi and Worf enter) 
TROI: Mother, we have to talk. 
LWAXANA: Yes, we certainly do, dear, but not just now. Well, how, er
how do I address him? 
TROI: Mother, we've come for Alexander. Please, forgive the intrusion. 
ERKO: Preferably he should be called by his ministerial title. 
LWAXANA: Ah. I'll remember. Oh, Mister Homn. You make everybody
comfortable until we get back. Especially the Minister, here. Now, I'll
be back. One hour, darling. I'll see you then. 
WORF: Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's dinner hour. 
LWAXANA: How thoughtless of me. I guess we'll just have to have a
little picnic before our mud bath. 
CAMPIO: We have business to deal with here. Leaving is simply not
acceptable. 
LWAXANA: Oh, well can't we just pretend it's acceptable? We'll be back.

CAMPIO: You are missing the point. 
WORF: Alexander, you will return to our quarters and have dinner. 
ALEXANDER: But we're going to go to the holodeck. 
TROI: Mother, you're undermining every effort we're trying to make
here. 
LWAXANA: Don't be absurd. You poor dear, don't they ever let you change
those colourless outfits? 
ERKO: It is essential that we begin a discussion of the wedding
procedures now. 
LWAXANA: Oh, Minister, darling, perhaps you and the Jerko here can come
with us. 
CAMPIO: Lwaxana, this exceeds all boundaries. 
LWAXANA: Oh. Well, half hour, then. No longer, I promise. Mister Homn,
your duties. 
CAMPIO: Counsellor Troi, have you no influence? 
TROI: Ha! 
ALEXANDER: Ha! 
CAMPIO: Lwaxana, if you will remain, I may allow the boy to stay 
ERKO: Definitely not! 
WORF: Definitely not. My son is to return to quarters. 
ERKO: Nor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation. 
(Lwaxana has sneaked out with Alexander) 
TROI: Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for this
one.
