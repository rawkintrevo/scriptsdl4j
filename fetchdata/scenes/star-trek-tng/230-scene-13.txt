PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Geordi enters) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, I understand that before the Jenolen crashed,
it had conducted an extensive survey of the Dyson sphere. Have we been
able to access any of those records? 
LAFORGE: We did try to download their memory core, but it was pretty
heavily damaged in the crash. We actually haven't been able to get much
out of it. 
PICARD: Perhaps Captain Scott could be of use in accessing that
material. 
LAFORGE: It's possible. He does know those systems better than any of
us. I'll have Lieutenant Bartel beam down with him. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, I would like you to accompany Captain Scott. 
LAFORGE: Me, sir? 
PICARD: Yes. Look, this is not an order, it's a request and it's one
which you must feel perfectly free to decline. You see, one of the most
important things in a person's life is to feel useful. Now, Mister
Scott is a Starfleet officer and I would like him to feel useful again.

LAFORGE: I'll go with him, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you.

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, I believe I have found something
on the sphere which could be a communications device. There's an
antenna array approximately four hundred thousand kilometres south of
our present position. It is emitting low intensity subspace signals. 
RIKER: Can you open a channel? 
DATA: No, sir, not from our present orbit. The array is currently
directed away from us. 
RIKER: Ensign, prepare to put us in orbit above those coordinates.
Captain Picard to the Bridge, please.
