TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER PULASKI DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Why? What is it? 
RIKER: This I think you should see for yourself. Bring Commander Data. 
[Shuttlebay two]

(Picard, Data and Troi enter) 
PICARD: Condition? 
PULASKI: The life signs are very confusing. His heartbeat is strong,
but the pulse is off. 
PICARD: Is he injured? 
PULASKI: There's no signs of trauma. 
PICARD: Why is he unconscious? What happened to him? 
PULASKI: I can't say. The readings of his brain waves are very strange.

PICARD: Strange? In what way? Non-human? Artificial? 
PULASKI: No, neither. They're just out of phase. 
PICARD: Can you revive him? 
PULASKI: I wouldn't even attempt it till we get him into Sickbay. Come
on, let's get him back. 
(The second Picard is wheeled away) 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: I have never felt anything quite like this before, so it's
difficult to put into words. That person is you. 
PICARD: No. 
TROI: He is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I am standing next
to. Beyond that, there is very little I can be sure of. I will have to
wait until he regains consciousness before knowing more. 
PICARD: Data, I need to know what's on the shuttle's logs. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Data gets into the shuttlecraft) 
DATA: Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained from the
shuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order to
activate the shuttle's systems. 
RIKER: Geordi 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Report to Shuttlebay two immediately. 
LAFORGE: I'm on my way. 
[Shuttlebay two]

PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed. 
RIKER: Captain, seen this? 
PICARD: Looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion. 
RIKER: It must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft. 
PICARD: Data, I need those logs. Counsellor. 
RIKER: We'll be on the Bridge. Lieutenant. 
(Geordi enters as Riker and Worf leave)
