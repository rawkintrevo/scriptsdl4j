LAFORGE [OC]: His chances of getting down there
safely are no better than fifty-fifty, in my opinion. 
WORF: Captain, a major storm front is moving in on the away team's
coordinates. 
PICARD: You're aware of the risks, Mister O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Yes sir.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I think I can make it. 
PICARD [OC]: All right then. Good luck. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

[Moon surface]

RIKER: Mister O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. 
O'BRIEN: Nice spot for a picnic, sir. We need to distribute these
enhancer rods at seven metre lengths. That should do it. 
RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,
Chief? 
O'BRIEN: I'd really like to get us out of here before it hits,
Commander. I'm supposed to be feeding the baby lunch. Molly gets in a
terribly foul mood if I'm late. 
RIKER: I'm with you. 
(the sky is very angry) 
RIKER: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it! 
(O'Brien goes to turn on the pattern enhancers, and gets hit by
lightning. They all fall down. Balls of light descend on them, but one
flies away from Riker, who wakes up. He activates the enhancers and
they are all beamed away)

[Sickbay]

(Troi wakes with a scream) 
CRUSHER: Easy, Deanna. 
TROI: Where? 
CRUSHER: Back on the Enterprise. You're going to be okay. 
TROI: My skin, it's tingling. 
CRUSHER: You're experiencing the afterimages of the electromagnetic
discharge. The sensation will pass. They're all fine, too. Now, I want
you to take your time, Counsellor. Doctor's orders. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Injury report, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Mostly minor abrasions. Commander Riker took the worst of it
with a broken arm.
PICARD: Mister Data. Good work, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: Ready for duty, sir. 
PICARD: You're sure, Number One? 
RIKER: It's not the first bone I've ever broken. 
PICARD: And how are you, Counsellor? 
TROI: Very glad to be here. 
PICARD: Good. Let's go. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: So what happened down there? 
RIKER: It was just one hell of a storm. It moved in on our position
faster than anything I've ever seen. 
PICARD: Was there any evidence of life?
