CRUSHER KURAK

[Science lab]

CRUSHER: That looks like one of Doctor Reyga's
shield configurations. 
KURAK: Yes. Personal research. 
CRUSHER: Even though this technology failed? 
KURAK: No one has denied there is potential in the idea. 
CRUSHER: Which you're now free to develop. 
KURAK: Are you accusing me of something? 
CRUSHER: No, but I want to know why you threatened Doctor Reyga. 
KURAK: I warned Doctor Reyga that if he persisted with his slander, he
would pay the price. 
CRUSHER: What was his accusation? 
KURAK: I will not repeat his lies. 
CRUSHER: Were they lies? 
KURAK: Be careful, Doctor. Insulting the honour of a Klingon can be
extremely dangerous. 
CRUSHER: Did Reyga make that mistake? 
(Kurak pushes Crusher and she hits the wall) 
KURAK: I have heard enough accusations! Now I will have your silence. 
CRUSHER: Well, you're going to have to throw me a lot harder than that
if you want to get it. Now, what did he accuse you of? 
KURAK: Sabotage. 
CRUSHER: Sabotage of the metaphasic shield? Was that why it failed? 
KURAK: How would I know? 
CRUSHER: Did you sabotage the project? 
KURAK: No. I did not. Goodbye, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Kurak refused to say anything more. I wasn't sure if her
silence was motivated by guilt or just Klingon pride. 
[Corridor]

CRUSHER [OC]: I was beginning to find out that
investigating a murder was a little more perilous than I'd thought. And
for everything I'd been though, I didn't have any more insight than I
did before I started.

[Morgue]

CRUSHER [OC]: Which brought me back to Reyga's
body. Because the more I thought about it, the more it seemed that the
answers had to be there. DNA traces, tissue anomalies, a wealth of
forensic clues that could shed some light on the mystery. So I made the
decision. 
(and Reyga's body is slid out of the chamber)
