TROI WORF PICARD RIKER LWAXANA TOG

[Bridge]

(Riker and Troi are beamed directly to the bridge) 
PICARD: Are you both all right? 
RIKER: None the worse for wear. 
TROI: My mother bought our freedom, Captain. She doesn't want to stay
with Tog. 
PICARD: Hail the Krayton. 
WORF: Frequencies open. DaiMon Tog responding. 
PICARD: On screen. 
TOG [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, so good of you to meet us. We were
on our way to Betazed to return our guests. 
PICARD: Of course you were, DaiMon. But you're still holding Lwaxana
Troi. 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: When will you get it through your thick head
that it's over between us, Jean-Luc? 
(mute transmission) 
TROI: I think I know what she's doing. You have to fight to get her
back, Captain. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: Er, er. It's not over between us, Lwaxana. You're mine and I
will not let you go. I insist you return to my side immediately. 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: You mean, you still care? (Picard ploughs into
a hotchpot of lines from Shakespeare's sonnets, 147, 141 and 8.)
PICARD: My love is a fever, longing still for that which longer nurseth
the disease.
LWAXANA: Tell me more.
PICARD: In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes, for they in thee a
thousand errors see. But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
who in despite of view are please'd to dote. Shall I compare the to a
summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

[Tog's quarters]

(As the
declaiming goes on in the background) 
TOG: You didn't tell me that you and Captain Picard were 
LWAXANA: You said you didn't want to hear about my other romances. I
have a new love, Jean-Luc.
