quarters]

(The Enterprise's floating poker game is in full
session) 
RIKER: Looking good. I'll go five. 
PULASKI: Five here. 
LAFORGE: And five more. 
DATA: I believe the wiser course of action here is to bend. 
LAFORGE: You mean fold, Data. 
DATA: That is correct. Fold. To bend. To make compact or to capitulate.

WORF: I raise fifty. 
DATA: I do not believe Lieutenant Worf understands all the nuances of
this betting procedure. 
RIKER: I wouldn't be so quick to judge, Data. His pile's a lot bigger
than yours. 
PULASKI: Than any of ours. 
DATA: The cards have been favouring the Lieutenant, but that is the
result of random chance, therefore, a temporary condition. 
LAFORGE: You hope. 
WORF: Talk or play. Not both. 
RIKER: Fifty, right? 
PULASKI: Fifty is the bet. What's the matter? Feet getting cold? 
RIKER: My cards are getting cold. Here you go. 
PULASKI: I'm glad you stayed in. I need the chips. 
LAFORGE: Talk, talk, talk 
PULASKI: Okay, here's the action. Fifty, and another fifty. 
LAFORGE: Ouch. Fold, fold, fold 
WORF: Your fifty, and fifty more. 
RIKER: Love to play, but not with these cards. 
PULASKI: Looks like it's just us, handsome. I'll see you. 
(Worf puts down three aces and two queens) 
PULASKI: Beats my straight. 
RIKER: The Iceman wins again. 
PULASKI: You took my last chip. You could at least smile, Worf. 
LAFORGE: Smiling would break his concentration. 
WORF: Your deal. 
DATA: (shuffles) Geordi. 
(Geordi cuts the pack) 
DATA: The game is seven card stud. After the queen, one-eyed jacks and
low card in the hole are wild. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute, let me write this down. 
((Everyone gets two hole cards and one face up) 
WORF: I open with fifty. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker. We're receiving a class eleven
emergency signal from Starfleet Command. 
RIKER: On my way. 
LAFORGE: Fifty? You were bluffing. 
WORF: Klingons never bluff. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, right.
