PICARD PRAK RIKER
mining don signal pulse access incident efforts captain happened

[Ready room]

PRAK: We detected what appeared to be a Federation
signal buoy. When we approached it, it emitted a massive verteron
pulse. Our warp drive, our sensors, our communications systems were all
disabled. We assumed we were the victims of a new Federation weapon. 
PICARD: The Federation established this corridor to ensure safe access
through this sector. We have nothing to gain from mining it. 
RIKER: Whatever happened to your ship may not have been an isolated
incident. A Federation Medical transport was recently lost in that
corridor. 
PRAK: We passed a Federation ship several days ago. It did not appear
to be in any distress. 
RIKER: Can you give us an idea of its heading? 
PRAK: It is possible that information was recorded in our sensor logs,
Commander. Unfortunately, my entire crew is occupied with our repairs.
I don't think there will be time to search our records. 
PICARD: DaiMon, if we assigned an Engineering team to assist you with
your repair efforts, would that give you time to retrieve your logs? 
PRAK: I believe it would, Captain.
