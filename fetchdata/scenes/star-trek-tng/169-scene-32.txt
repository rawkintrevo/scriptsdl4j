acceleration seven ahead point seconds diagnostic impulse estimated speed

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The injectors aren't responding to the
diagnostic commands. 
BARCLAY: I think we should drop out of warp. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Recommend we go to impulse power, Captain. 
PICARD: Take us out of warp. 
DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. 
[Engineering]

BARCLAY: It's the injectors. 
LAFORGE: Override. 
BARCLAY: It's not a computer problem. The mechanism is physically
jammed. I can't clear it. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Speed increasing, sir. Warp seven point six,
seven point six five. Warp seven point seven. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We can't shut it down, Captain. Antimatter
flow is increasing. She's accelerating out of control.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: There's nothing I can do. 
WORF: Approaching warp nine sir. 
PICARD: Red alert. 
RIKER: Estimated time to structural failure. 
DATA: At this rate of acceleration, fifteen minutes forty seconds, sir.

RIKER: Did you copy that, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, Commander. 
RIKER: Recommendations.
