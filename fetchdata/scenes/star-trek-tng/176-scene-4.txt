TROI WORF PICARD JONO CRUSHER DATA

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: He managed to escape radiation trauma but
the scan shows something else. 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: Two previously fractured ribs, a broken arm, and a low grade
concussion. There might be neurological impairment. I'd like to examine
him further. Jean-Luc, the Talarians have been known to be ruthless to
their enemies. I think there's a real possibility they may have
brutalised the child. 
PICARD: Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to his
captivity? 
CRUSHER: Not likely. He's been with them a long time. Long enough to
assimilate their cultural traits, and calcium trace patterns indicate
the injuries took place during the past seven years. 
PICARD: But if they have abused the boy, why would he so devoutly wish
to return to them? 
CRUSHER: It's not uncommon. It was identified centuries ago as the
Stockholm syndrome. 
(There's a commotion) 
[Sickbay]

(Jono is writhing on a bed as people try to hold
him down. He escapes from them and runs around) 
TROI: Jono, what is it? Jono! I just suggested he take off his gloves.
Suddenly he lost control. 
CRUSHER: Security, we need some assistance down here in Sickbay. 
PICARD: Jono! 
JONO: She won't leave me alone! She keeps trying to dissect me! 
PICARD: She was trying to help you.! 
JONO: I don't want her help! I should be back with my brothers! Send us
back to Captain Endar! 
PICARD: Jono, I want you to stop this immediately! 
JONO: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Good. That's better. Now, if we're to accomplish anything 
DATA [OC]: Data to Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
DATA [OC]: We have received a subspace communiqu from Starfleet
Command regarding the young human, sir. 
PICARD: Very well. Doctor, Counsellor. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf, escort this young man to quarters. He is to
be confined there until further notice. 
WORF: Yes, Doctor.
