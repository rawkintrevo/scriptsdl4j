[Turbolift]

LAFORGE: Deck two. On the other hand, I remember
everything about the time I got my first pet. A Circassian cat. I was
eight. I remember how funny-looking he was. I remember how excited I
was. It's as if it happened last week. 
DATA: Perhaps you remember the pleasant memories and forget the
unpleasant ones? 
LAFORGE: No, sometimes the bad memories can be the most intense of all.

DATA: It would seem there is no predictable pattern to human memory. 
LAFORGE: It would seem.

[Dining room]

JEV: This library of ours has been in the planning
stages for years. A collection of the retrieved memories of races from
many different star systems. 
GUEST0: What my son means to say is, we think of ourselves as
archaeologists of the mind. We believe that the history of a
world is contained in the personal experience of its people. 
PICARD: Rather like the ancient oral historians on Earth. 
GUEST0: Exactly. The library we propose will be a vast storehouse of
these individual memories. 
RIKER: That sounds like quite a project. How long will it take to
finish your studies on Kaldra? 
GUEST2: (a silver-haired woman) Many months. We've been working for
years, and we've surveyed only eleven planets in eight star systems. 
JEV: But it's our way of life. We wouldn't want to do anything else. 
CRUSHER: Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us a demonstration of his
abilities this afternoon. It's fascinating. Perhaps you would like to
resurrect some memories. 
GUEST0: I'd be happy to probe your recollections, Captain. Most people
find it an enjoyable experience. 
PICARD: I'm sure. However, I don't think I would make a particularly
good subject. 
CRUSHER: I'm sure you'd be ideal, and you must have some intriguing
memories. 
GUEST0: We won't be on your ship for long. This may be your last
chance. 
PICARD: Yes. Well. 
GUEST2: Tarmin, we mustn't influence people. We must let them come to us
willingly. 
GUEST0: I have found over the years there are many who want the
experience of memory retrieval, but who lack some encouragement in
order to come forward. 
GUEST0: You, Mister Worf? I would love to explore Klingon memories. 
WORF: Klingons do not allow themselves to be probed. 
GUEST0: But there is nothing to fear. 
JEV: Father. 
WORF: I am not fearful. 
GUEST0: Commander La Forge, you? 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. Thanks anyway. 
GUEST0: I have rarely encountered such squeamish people. Doctor
Crusher? Commander Riker? 
TROI: Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians able to read memories? 
GUEST0: Oh, no, my dear. The technique requires special training. It is
a serious commitment. 
GUEST2: It takes years of study. Tarmin is the most proficient of our
group. 
GUEST0: Once Jev spent two days with a contingent of elderly Gentons.
He couldn't get anything from them. I spent only one hour with them and
retrieved a fragment from the Gentonian trade wars. 
JEV: Excuse me. 
(Jev exits hurriedly) 
GUEST2: Exactly how long will it be before we reach Kaldra, Captain? 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Four days, eleven hours.
