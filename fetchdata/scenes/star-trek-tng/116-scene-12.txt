(Bynars with a different style of clothes are
working) 
RIKER: How's it going? 
ZERO ZERO: (left hand side) We are almost done.

ZERO ZERO: caused by a previous 
ONE ONE: probe has been corrected 
ZERO ZERO: You may use the equipment 
ONE ONE: anytime you wish. 
RIKER: How much has been changed? What exactly did you do? 
ONE ONE: Enhancement. 
ZERO ZERO: Nothing more. 
(They talk to each other in binary) 
ZERO ZERO: Would you like to try 
ONE ONE: the enhancement? 
RIKER: All right. What should I choose? Computer, I'd like some place
to play some music. A little atmosphere. 
COMPUTER: Specify. 
RIKER: Jazz. 
COMPUTER: Era? 
RIKER: Circa 1958. 
COMPUTER: Location. 
RIKER: Kansas City. No, wait. New Orleans. Bourbon Street Bar, New

[Holodeck]

(A nightclub with a slightly raised stage, tables
with candles for light) 
RIKER: Very good. Very good indeed. Now I'll need someone to play with.
A trio. Piano, bass and drums, and a 'bone for me. 
(The musicians appear) 
RIKER: Now an audience. Whoa. Too many. I was thinking of something a
little more intimate. 
(A single blonde in a red dress) 
RIKER: Great job, boys. But, computer, blondes and jazz seldom go
together. (a red-head) Now that is truly exceptional. But more sultry. 
(A brunette at the bar) 
RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement, you've got a
gift for understatement. 
(The Bynars work on the internal controls as the band starts playing) 
RIKER: What's your name? Tell me you love jazz. 
MINUET: My name is Minuet and I love all jazz except Dixieland. 
RIKER: Why not Dixieland? 
MINUET: You can't dance to it. 
RIKER: My girl. What's a knockout like you doing in a
computer-generated gin joint like this? 
MINUET: Waiting for you. 
RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious. 
MINUET: Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. 
(The Bynars leave)

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Can I ask you a question about the Bynars? 
QUINTEROS: Why not just ask them? 
WESLEY: What is that high-speed sound you make? 
ZERO ONE: That is our 
ONE ZERO: primary language. 
WESLEY: How can you process information at that speed? 
ZERO ONE: We store the information 
ONE ZERO: with these buffers. 
(on their belts) 
ZERO ONE: We receive information 
ONE ZERO: all the time 
ZERO ONE: and save it 
ONE ZERO: until we need it. 
WESLEY: How did you happen to develop this ability? 
ONE ZERO: It happened over 
ZERO ONE: a long period of time. 
WESLEY: To have a society so intermixed on computers has tremendous
advantages. 
ONE ZERO: And a few 
ZERO ONE: disadvantages. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Everything under control, Ensign Crusher? 
WESLEY: Fine, Captain. I was just trying to find something about the
Bynars. 
PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? 
WESLEY: He's in holodeck four. Shall I call him for you, sir? 
PICARD: No, I'll go down there myself. Keep me apprised. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.
