PICARD: Red alert. 
DATA: A second ship has joined the attack on the Bortas. 
PICARD: It's begun.

[Gowron's Bridge]

GOWRON: Send an emergency signal to any loyal
ships! 
HELMSMAN: Impulse engines not responding! 
(there's an explosion. Worf takes the Klingon's station) 
GOWRON: Engage emergency override! 
WORF: Override engaged. Disruptors still not responding.

[Bridge]

DATA: The Bortas has lost her port shields, sir. It
is unlikely they will withstand another hit at that quarter. Their
primary life support has failed, sir. 
RIKER: The Bortas has put out a general distress call. 
PICARD: Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from the
combat area. Half impulse. 
RIKER: Captain, the Bortas is Gowron's ship. If he's the legitimate
leader of the Empire, shouldn't we help him? 
PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging the
Federation into a Klingon civil war. 
RIKER: What about Worf? 
PICARD: Ensign, engage.

[Gowron's Bridge]

KLINGON: Port shields are still down. 
WORF: Disruptors online. 
GOWRON: Lock on target. 
WORF: No. Don't you see? Their sensors will detect the weapons lock. If
they think we're helpless, they will try to board the ship.
I can aim and fire disruptors manually when they drop their shields. 
GOWRON: GhoS. 
WORF: Thirty five thousand kellicams. Twenty thousand kellicams. Now
within transporter range. 
GOWRON: SuH. 
WORF: They're dropping their shields. 
GOWRON: BaH! 
(KaBOOM) 
WORF: Firing on second target. 
KLINGON: They were able to raise the shields in time. Minor damage
only. 
(the ship fires on the Bortas) 
WORF: Disruptors offline. 
GOWRON: All power to shields. 
KLINGON: Shields failing! 
(another Klingon ship swoops in and drives off their attacker) 
WORF: Incoming message. 
GOWRON: On viewer. 
KURN [on viewscreen]: This is Captain Kurn of the Hegh'ta. We come to
defend the Empire and to follow the banner of Gowron. 
WORF: The enemy has sustained major damage to its life support systems
They have disengaged. 
GOWRON: You have done well, Commander Kurn. Lursa and B'Etor have moved
more quickly than I anticipated. We shall not
underestimate them again. Meet us at the Great Hall. 
(transmission ends) 
GOWRON: Advise the Enterprise that their delegation is welcome to
attend my installation as leader.

Captain's log, stardate 44998.3. With new-found
support, Gowron has chosen to proceed with the installation ceremony.
The Enterprise has returned so that I may perform my final duty as
Arbiter of Succession.
