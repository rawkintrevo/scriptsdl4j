PICARD: Yes, wherever possible. 
MOT: So, this time you were lucky. I suppose all's well that ends well
but if I'd been in your shoes 
PICARD: Well, you know, that really does look very nice, Mister Mot. I
think that will be sufficient. 
MOT: Hold on (trims a sideburn) There. I must tell you, Captain, Will
Riker was in for a trim yesterday and he agrees with me a hundred per
cent.
