[Hill's office]

MADELINE: There's a gentleman here to see you,
Mister Hill. And he doesn't look like a client. 
SLADE: Hill? The name is Slade Bender. 
PICARD: Excuse me. (turns off the radio) What can I do for you, Mister
Bender? 
SLADE: It's about Alva. 
PICARD: You'll have to be a little more precise. 
SLADE: Okay, you want to play stupid? That's jake with me. A week ago a
man came in here. He wanted you to find his girlfriend. Name's Alva. 
PICARD: Did I find her? 
SLADE: You know, you're getting on my nerves. You found her, all right.
Face down in the river. 
PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. 
SLADE: Yeah, yeah, we're all broken up about it. Especially the
boyfriend, who's been
indicted for murder. 
PICARD: And what are you here to do? Ask for a refund? 
SLADE: Nah, I'm here to kill you! 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, this isn't what I wanted
at all. It's much to violent. I'm here to relax, not to dodge bullets.
Reconfigure. 
COMPUTER: Please define. 
PICARD: More ambience. Less substance. 
COMPUTER: Do you wish to leave the holodeck and re-enter, or continue
from this point?

PICARD: I will continue. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. You may continue. 
MADELINE: There's a gentleman here to see you, Mister Hill. 
PICARD: Thank you, Madeline. 
MAN: You a private dick? 
PICARD: That's what it says on my door. 
MAN: Is that supposed to be funny? 'Cos if it is, you gotta know that I
ain't in the mood for funny. Now, I came here on serious business.
There's a job I want you to do for me. 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Clear. Computer, this still isn't
right. One kind of violence is being substituted for another.
Reconfigure. 
COMPUTER: You may continue. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
(Slade bursts in with a machine gun) 
SLADE: You're through ducking me, Hill! 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme! Variations on a theme. Computer,
perhaps I am not clearly defining my intent. 
COMPUTER: The flexibility of the programme is limited to the parameters
of the Dixon Hill novels. 
PICARD: Yes. Of course. 
[Transporter room]

WORF: Even in this state, they possess a certain
dignity, a graceful countenance. 
WESLEY: If you say so, Lieutenant. 
WORF: I see. Is this how you felt when you first saw me? 
WESLEY: Well, maybe at first, a little. But now that I've seen more
Klingons, I've come to think you're handsome for a Klingon. That didn't
quite come out the way I meant, sir. 
(Lwaxana and Homn enter) 
LWAXANA: I still say they look better in sauce. When will the good
Captain revive them? 
WESLEY: Not until we reach Pacifica, ma'am. 
LWAXANA: You seem a fine boy. One day you'll grow up to be a big,
strong man. But I'm afraid I cannot afford to wait for you to mature.
Now that's more like it. Your thoughts, they're primal, savage. I like
that in a man. 
WORF: I am not a man. 
LWAXANA: Which is in your favour, men so often being irrational and
egotistical. But
unfortunately, I've grown accustomed to human companionship. Pity.
You'd have made a fine choice. Well, who's next, Mister Homn? 
(Homn thinks, then puts his hand across his eyes) 
LWAXANA: Ah yes. Let's do it, I'm not getting any younger. 
(Lwaxana and Homn leave) 
WESLEY: What was that all about?

[Hill's outer office]

PICARD: So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activate
programme. 
MADELINE: Leaving, Dix? You're not to Rex's bar, are you? 
PICARD: Rex's bar? Why do you ask? 
MADELINE: It's one of the messages I left on your desk. 
PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? 
MADELINE: Me? Have a drink with you? 
PICARD: Why not? 
MADELINE: There ain't no why not about it. It's just that this is the
first time you ever asked. 
PICARD: Is that a problem? 
MADELINE: Not for me, but you'd better take this. (a revolver) 
PICARD: Why? 
MADELINE: Because if we're going to Rex's bar, you're gonna need it.

[Rex's Bar]

(Mostly empty, Moonlight Serenade playing, ceiling
fans turning lazily) 
REX: Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this?
(newspaper) Germany's getting ready to invade England. 
MADELINE: Who's going to stop them? 
REX: Somebody'd better. 
MADELINE: Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs to
do is fight in another world war. 
PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did end
with the United States taking its place as a dominant world power and
cultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century.
Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement.
Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourth
century. 
REX: I don't know if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you've got
a snootful already. 
PICARD: What's this? 
REX: The usual. 
PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. 
REX: What else? 
(Picard takes Madeline's proffered cigarette, Rex lights it. He takes a
puff then looks at it from arms length) 
REX: And for the lady? 
MADELINE: Rye and ginger. 
(Rex taps the bar and rubs his fingers together. Picard imitates him) 
PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I must
remember not to let this happen again. 
REX: Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're up the
sleeve halfway to my collar. 
PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? 
REX: No, it's on account of Jimmy Cuzzo. 
PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. 
MADELINE: He's why I gave you the gun. 
PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot's
Claw. 
MADELINE: Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They
never would have nailed him if it hadn't been for you. Your testimony
got him arraigned. 
REX: Yeah. Yours and mine. 
PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face him
alone. 
REX: I don't want to face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us
together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight. 
PICARD: And if it doesn't? 
REX: Then you just have to kill him.
