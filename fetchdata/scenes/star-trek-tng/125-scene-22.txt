CRUSHER: Retinal scans are an exact match It really
is Quinn. 
LAFORGE: How can that be? The man picked me up like a rag doll. 
CRUSHER: I'm going to have to do a complete internal scan. 
LAFORGE: Keep me posted, Doctor, I'll be on the Bridge. 
(She spots something at the back of Quinn's neck) 
CRUSHER: What is that? 
(A pointed something sticking out, wiggling)

AARON: What do you know of conspiracies, Captain? 
PICARD: Not nearly enough, I suppose. 
AARON: That's the charming thing about them, isn't it? When a
machination is real, no one knows about it. And when it's suspected,
it's almost never real. 
SAVAR: Except, of course, in paranoid delusions for those who believe. 
REMMICK: Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is served. 
AARON: Wonderful. Bantering with the Captain has given me quite an
appetite. 
PICARD: I need to contact my ship to let Commander Riker that we're
about to sit down. 
SAVAR: Of course, Captain. We'll wait for you at the table. 
(Picard is left alone) 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher here, Captain.

CRUSHER: May I speak freely?
