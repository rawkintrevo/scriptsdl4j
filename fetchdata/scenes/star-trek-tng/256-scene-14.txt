[Mercenary cargo hold]

(Picard is scanning artefacts already in storage) 
PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number four
seven eight B. Access spectral analysis and begin scan, mode three. 
COMPUTER: Scan complete. Terikon particle decay profile does not fall
within specified reference range. Probability of match zero point zero
four percent. 
PICARD: Computer, reset diagnostic for new sample, lot number three six
nine B. 
(Tallera enters) 
PICARD: Access spectral analysis, mode two, begin scan. 
TALLERA: Baran wants to see the analysis of the last lot. He thinks
you're moving a little slowly. 
PICARD: You can tell Baran if he wants the analysis done faster, he can
do it himself. If he wants it done correctly, he can wait. 
TALLERA: Do you enjoy living dangerously, Galen? Baran can kill you in
an instant if he activates his control device. 
PICARD: I doubt that he'll do that. I've increased the accuracy of the
identification process by a factor of ten. I'm the best person to
analyse these artefacts. Baran knows that. 
TALLERA: He may need you now, but I know Baran, and I can tell you he's
not going to back down forever. You accomplish nothing by provoking
him. 
PICARD: I don't like operating in the dark. If I knew what the point of
this mission were, why I was analysing these relics. 
TALLERA: If Baran felt it were wise to let the crew know that, I'm sure
he would have. 
PICARD: Do you know what all this is about? 
TALLERA: What Baran knows, I know. 
PICARD: Then what's going on here. Why are we risking our lives taking
these artefacts? Who wants them? 
TALLERA: I see no reason to tell you anything, but you can rest assured
I don't necessarily share everything I know with Baran, either. This
conversation, for example, will stay between us. 
PICARD: You can tell Baran every word that I've said. He knows that I
don't think much of him as a leader. 
TALLERA: He's been in charge of this crew for a long time. 
PICARD: Baran wouldn't last five minutes as captain if he didn't have
that control device. The crew follow him because they have no choice.
Baran's power is based on fear and intimidation. 
TALLERA: That almost sounds like a prelude to mutiny. 
PICARD: If someone were to challenge him, the rest of the crew would
follow. 
TALLERA: I was right. You do like living dangerously. I like you,
Galen. I can tolerate a lot from someone like you, but only to a point.
I intend to complete this mission successfully and get what's been
promised me. If it looks as though you're getting in the way of that,
I'll deal with you myself.
