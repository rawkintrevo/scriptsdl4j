LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Turbolift]

WESLEY: Deck six.

[Transporter room]

CRUSHER: Wesley? 
(She hands him his case, and hugs him) 
CRUSHER: Take care. 
WESLEY: You too, Mom. 
CRUSHER: Something the matter? 
WESLEY: We've been scanning Ferengi transmissions, trying to find the
Krayton. One of the signals was, I don't know, familiar somehow. 
CRUSHER: Something in the message? 
WESLEY: No, the message was scrambled. It was the static! 
CRUSHER: Where are you going?

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain. The Bradbury has informed us they
can wait no longer for Mister Crusher to come aboard. 
(Wesley dashes in)
PICARD: Wesley.
WESLEY: Captain, I think there's a pattern to the subspace interference
I heard on one of the Ferengi messages. 
PICARD: Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss the
Bradbury. 
WESLEY: The interference itself could be a message. If I could just
hear a replay of the subspace scans. 
PICARD: Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengi
transmissions. 
WESLEY: Wait. Repeat that one. Put it on a continuous replay. Hear that
popping noise? Data, can you filter out everything but that sound? 
LAFORGE: That's Cochrane distortion. A fluctuation in the phase of the
subspace field. All warp engines generate that kind of interference. 
WESLEY: But listen to the pattern. It's the Algolian ceremonial rhythm
that the musician played at the reception. 
DATA: Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation. 
PICARD: Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. He
selected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss as
static. 
WORF: Signal source located, Captain. 
PICARD: Plot an intercept course. 
WESLEY: Course plotted and laid in, sir. 
PICARD: Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp eight. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage.
