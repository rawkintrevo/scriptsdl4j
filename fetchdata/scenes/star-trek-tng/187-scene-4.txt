WORF: They are transmitting again. 
PICARD: On screen, before we lose contact. 
CLARK [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, Enterprise! Do you read me?
Emergency! We need help! 
PICARD: Doctor Clark, this is Captain Picard. We are ready to beam you
and your staff on board the 
CLARK [on viewscreen]: They're in! 
PICARD: Transporter room three. Lock onto the science team and beam
them aboard. 
CHIEF [OC]: I've locked onto Doctor Clark. I can't pick out the others.
It's a mess down there. 
PICARD: Then beam Doctor Clark aboard by himself. 
CHIEF [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort him to my ready room. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, try to make some sense out of this mess.

[Ready room]

CLARK: The people in Ventax Two live in an agrarian
society. At least, they do now. 
PICARD: What do you mean, now? 
CLARK: It's an interesting anthropological question. One we were
studying before the trouble began. In the distant past, the Ventaxian
culture had achieved an extremely advanced scientific level, but a
millennium ago they turned their backs on technology. 
PICARD: They reverted to a simpler existence? 
CLARK: And remained that way for centuries. First contact was made by a
Klingon expedition seventy years ago. Since then, the new technology
has been available to the Ventaxians. They simply are not interested in
it. Virtually no social problems to be found on this planet, In fact, I
would have described their society as idyllic until 
PICARD: Until what, Doctor? 
CLARK: It's hard to believe. Several years ago, Acost Jared, the
Ventaxian head of state, began to grow increasingly obsessed with the
legend of Ardra. With each passing day, he grew more anxious, and he
talked about little else. Ardra is coming back. Ardra will be here
soon. We must all leave before Ardra returns. 
PICARD: And who is this Ardra? 
CLARK: For all intents and purposes, the devil. Captain, these people
actually believe they've sold their souls to the devil. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Have you located the science team, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: Evidently they're being held hostage. 
CLARK: Hostage? 
RIKER [OC]: There's a Ventaxian leader on the viewscreen, name of Acost
Jared. 
PICARD: Doctor.
