JACK: Wesley. 
WESLEY: Dad? 
JACK: You've reached the end, Wesley. 
WESLEY: The end of what? 
JACK: This journey. The one you started a long time ago, when I left
you and your mother. 
WESLEY: You mean when you died. 
JACK: You set out on a journey that wasn't your own. Now it's time to
find a path that is truly yours. Don't follow me any further. 
WESLEY: I don't understand. 
JACK: Yes, you do. It's just hard for you to accept. Goodbye, Wesley,
and good luck. 
WESLEY: Dad, wait!

WORF: Mister Crusher. Are you all right? 
WESLEY: Yeah, Worf, I'm fine. 
WORF: (to security woman) Lay out a confinement beam trace along the
southeastern side of the village. Be discreet. We do not wish to alarm
these people. 
SECURITY: Yes, sir. 
WESLEY: Worf, what are you doing?

removed from their homes. 
WORF: I understand, but now is not the time or the place to 
WESLEY: (shouts) Do you know what they're trying to do? They're
preparing to beam you away and take you to their ship. You're not going
to let them do that, are you? 
WAKASA: No, we won't. Leave now.
