DATA: In both cases, the time distortions occurred
along the same continuum as a preview or a reprise of a specific point
in time. 
PICARD: Where we are, where we were, and where we will be. Data, I want
this to be an away team of one. You. I don't think there's any reason
to risk anyone else. 
DATA: It is reasonable, sir. After all, I am a machine and dispensable.

PICARD: Indispensable is the appropriate word. I think it should be
only you because you seem more able to control the effects of the time
distortion. 
DATA: Oh, I see, sir. That is quite true, sir. I see time as a
constant, whereas humans
perceive time as flexible. Hence the expression, times flies when
you're having fun, which until now has always confused me. 
PICARD: Well, I want you to put a stitch in time and, er, save much
more than nine. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: If other members of the away team became disoriented, it could
create additional problems and perhaps increase the danger. 
DATA: I will go immediately, sir. 
PICARD: Good luck, Data. 
[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: All right. We have the coordinates exactly
as the Professor specified. 
[Vandor corridor]

(Data arrives safely) 
DATA: Enterprise. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard. 
DATA: I am proceeding to the lab, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Maintain an open frequency, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Then he has to dodge a laser beam and take out the emitters)

 PICARD: Mister Data, what's going on? 
[Vandor corridor]

DATA: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of his
security precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. 
[Laboratory]

(The code works, but the fluorescent tubes only
open part way. Data enters cautiously. In the centre is a distortion)
PICARD [OC]: Mister Data, this channel will remain open. Please
continue to report. 
DATA: This appears to be the instrument Doctor Manheim described. It
should confirm when the next time effect will occur. 
RIKER [OC]: Data?
