BELL: Spill it! 
PICARD: I've told you everything I know. 
BELL: Well, you'll just have to tell us again. From the top. From the
top! 
PICARD: Oh, very good. I've read all this before, you know. It's
absolutely as it should be. 
BELL: Spill it!

[Outside Holodeck]

LAFORGE: LaForge to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
LAFORGE: I can't find the Captain, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: I told you, he's in the holodeck.
LAFORGE: I'm at the holodeck. Something's gone wrong.
RIKER [OC]: What are you saying? 
LAFORGE: I can't communicate with him, I can't access the programme,
and I can't open the doors.

to contact the Captain.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeck
three. 
WESLEY: Commander? I've studied all the technical manuals on the
holodecks, sir. I think I can be of some help down there. 
RIKER: Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Right
now, your duty's here on the Bridge.
TROI: Will. His mother's missing too. 
RIKER: Come on, Wesley.
