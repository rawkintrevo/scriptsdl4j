RIKER: Ensign, you take that area. 
ENSIGN: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Geordi? 
LAFORGE: It's tough to get accurate sensor readings. There's an awful
lot of interference in the area. 
RIKER: From what? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure. It's very unlocalised. It could be atmospheric. 
RIKER: What do you make of these? 
(charred pits in the ground) 
LAFORGE: Well, these ruins around here are pretty ancient but I'd say
that this indentation was made fairly recently. Could be the site of
some battlefield. 
RIKER: It doesn't look like any blast point I've ever seen. The shape
is too perfect. 
LAFORGE: Sir, there's microcrystalline damage all throughout this area.
The same kind of pattern that Doctor Crusher picked up in the floor of
that bar on Dessica Two. 
WORF: Commander! I found something. 
(a pottery urn and other things in the sand) 
RIKER: Looks as if someone could have just dropped them. 
(the spare security guard gets shot, everyone takes cover from the
incessant energy weapons) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise. We are under attack down here. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: I repeat, we are under attack. 
GIUSTI: (a young woman) Commander, we've lost contact with the away
team. 
DATA: Is there a malfunction? 
GIUSTI: No, sir. The comm. system is being jammed. 
DATA: What is the source? 
GIUSTI: Somewhere on the surface. 
DATA: Bridge to Transporter room two. Can you get a lock on the away
team? 
CHIEF [OC]: Negative, sir. There's too much interference.
