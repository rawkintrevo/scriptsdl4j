[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I've got them. There's a forty percent
drop in mass. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN [OC]: I may have lost one of them. 
[Transporter room]

(Four children dressed the same as the shuttle
occupants appear. The tall skinny youth in Starfleet uniform, with a
healthy crop of hair, speaks) 
PICARD JR: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Another moment and 
(he stops, startled by his own high-pitched voice, and looks at his
diminutive companions. Gulp.)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: According to the bioscans, their DNA
structure is now consistent with those of preadolescence. But as far as
we can tell, only their bodies were changed. 
TROI: Their individual intelligence and their behavioural responses are
exactly the same as they were before the accident. 
PICARD JR: What happened to the shuttlecraft, Number One? 
RIKER: The shuttle broke up just after we beamed you out. Mister Data
is coordinating the salvage efforts now. Sir. 
CRUSHER: What about the energy field the shuttle passed through? 
RIKER: We've trying to scan it, but it's we're running into lot of
interference. It's going to take some time. 
PICARD JR: We can't afford to stay here any longer. We'll leave a class
four probe behind to study the energy
field but the distress signal from Ligos Seven has top priority. Let me
know as soon as you have any further information, Doctor. Number One,
you're with me. 
CRUSHER: Captain, I need to run some additional tests. 
PICARD JR: Of course. The three of you will remain as needed to assist
Doctor Crusher. 
(Riker and Picard leave) 
RO JR: What? 
GUINAN JR: You know, you make a pretty cute kid. 
RO JR: Great. Just what I want to be. Cute. 
GUINAN JR: Were you this much fun when you were a kid? 
RO JR: I was in a refugee camp. Fun wasn't exactly in my vocabulary. 
GUINAN JR: What about now? You're not in that camp anymore. 
RO JR: Fun is being back at work in my own uniform.

[Turbolift]

PICARD JR: Bridge.

[Bridge]

PICARD JR: Mister Worf. Prepare to launch a class
four probe to study the energy field. 
(everyone just stares) 
PICARD JR: I realise how unusual this must seem. My appearance is the
result of an accident, involving myself and three other crew members,
the effects of which Doctor Crusher is currently working to remedy. I
assure you I am Captain Picard. 
(Riker gives a nod) 
WORF: The probe. Aye, sir. 
PICARD JR: Mister Data, have you secured all of the shuttle debris? 
DATA: Almost. It is being stored in shuttlebay two. Sir. 
PICARD JR: Very well. Ensign, as soon as Mister Data is finished take
us to Ligos at warp eight. 
CRUSHER: Captain, may I see you privately for a few moments? 
PICARD JR: Of course.

[Ready room]

PICARD JR: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Have you been able
to determine the cause of our transformation? 
CRUSHER: Not yet. I'm still waiting for some test results. 
PICARD JR: I see. There are one hundred and three members of the
science team on Ligos Seven. We should prepare
shuttlebay three for a triage centre in case they have large numbers of
casualties. 
CRUSHER: We'll be ready. 
PICARD JR: I see that Ligos Seven is prone to periodic volcanic
activity. Perhaps the planet has entered an active phase. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. We need to talk. 
PICARD JR: All right. Let's talk. Are you here to relieve me of duty? 
CRUSHER: I'd rather not have to take that step. 
PICARD JR: I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My judgement, my experiences, my
mental capacities are all intact. 
CRUSHER: That's true, for now. But this could be the first stage of a
condition that may begin to affect your mind as well. 
PICARD JR: But you see no evidence of that. 
CRUSHER: Not yet. What I do know is that the Captain of this ship has
undergone an extreme physical transformation, the ultimate effects of
which I can't even begin to guess. 
PICARD JR: You are asking me to step down. 
CRUSHER: You are still Jean-Luc Picard. What do you think you should
do?

[Bridge]

PICARD JR: Commander Riker, please take command of
the ship until further notice. 
RIKER: Understood.
