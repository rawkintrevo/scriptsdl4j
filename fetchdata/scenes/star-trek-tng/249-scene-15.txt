KAHLESS GOWRON WORF

[Kahless' quarters]

(Kahless and Worf share a drink) 
WORF: I am sorry. Our replicators do not do justice to Klingon Warnog. 
KAHLESS: It has been so long since I have tasted any food or drink.
There are many things I have forgotten. 
WORF: Kahless, may I ask you about death and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me, what
awaits us beyond this life. 
KAHLESS: I do not have those answers. I am merely a traveller, someone
who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next. While
I am in this form, I know only about this world. And there is much work
for me to do in this world, and you will be part of it, Worf. 
WORF: Me? 
KAHLESS: It was your purity of heart that summoned me back from
Sto-Vo-Kor, and Koroth has told me about the respect you have earned in
the Federation and the Empire. I want you to have a place at my side as
we restore honour to our people. Let me tell you about this new Empire
we will forge.

[Observation lounge]

WORF: It will be glorious! 
GOWRON: It will be war. You are not a fool, Worf. Do you really think
that every Klingon in the Empire will bend his knee and grovel before
this man just because Koroth says he is Kahless? 
WORF: He is Kahless. Your own test proved it. 
GOWRON: I will not hand over the Empire to Koroth because of one test. 
WORF: It is not Koroth, it is 
GOWRON: Of course it is Koroth! Open your eyes. Koroth and the other
Guardians have always opposed me. This is nothing more than a ploy for
them to finally seize power. Even now, there are warriors on my own
ship who want to see Kahless. There are others who believe he is an
imposter. The divisions are already forming. 
WORF: But it does not have to be this way. We could all join together
and welcome Kahless as a united people. 
GOWRON: Don't you see? This is exactly why they want you to join them.
Because your brother sits on the Council and your voice carries weight
in the Empire. They want you to influence others to follow them. Worf,
we fought together once side by side to keep the Empire from being torn
apart. Will you stand by and let these impostors destroy all that we
fought so hard to protect? Renounce him, Worf. Stand with me and we can
hold the Empire together. 
WORF: You do not understand. Kahless is our future. Only with his help
can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves. Listen to him,
Gowron. Open your heart. Hear his words. He will restore your faith as
he has restored mine. Give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse
your heart before you take up arms.
