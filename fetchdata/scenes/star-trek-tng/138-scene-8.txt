(Riker, Data and Worf are the away team) 
O'BRIEN: Give me a moment, gents. We're dealing with an extremely
narrow access point. 
RIKER: Phasers on stun. Ready when you are. 
O'BRIEN: I believe we've got it now. You have a green light, Commander.

RIKER: Energise.

(Nothing. Absolute void, except for..) 
DATA: Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away, yet they do
not appear to penetrate this breathable zone. 
RIKER: It's like the eye of a hurricane. 
WORF: Commander, what is that? 
(It is a revolving door, with art nouveau decoration. No building, just
the turning door and it's frame) 
RIKER: A door. 
DATA: The structure must be here, yet we cannot see it. 
RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Riker. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: As your read out shows, this is an
unusual place.

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Completely calm, no sound, no movement, yet
a few hundred metres away a storm is raging. 
PICARD [OC]: Any information about the structure. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. There is an antique revolving door. It could be an
entrance.
