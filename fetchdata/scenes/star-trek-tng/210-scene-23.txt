PICARD: Report. 
DATA: We have passed through the wave, Captain. 
FELTON: We have dropped to warp seven point two. The wave is directly
astern at a distance of twenty three kilometres. 
WORF: Deflector strength is down to twelve percent. There are
fluctuations in several warp transfer conduits. Tractor beams and
transporters offline. 
RIKER: We have some gaps in the aft shields, Captain. When the
torpedoes explode, these areas will be contaminated with
ion radiation. We need to evacuate sections twenty four to forty seven,
decks thirty five through thirty eight. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
WORF: Sir, there is a fire in biolab four, The fire suppression
apparatus is not functioning. 
PICARD: Seal off the compartment. Prepare to vent the air from 
DATA: Sir, there are life forms present in that biolab. 
RIKER: We're transporting endangered animals from Corvan Two. 
DATA: Readings also indicate the presence of a humanoid, Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, identify humanoid life form in biolab four. 
COMPUTER: Life form is identified as Alexander Rozhenko. 
PICARD: Bridge to biolab four. Alexander, can you hear us? 
WORF: Sensors show he is alive. He may be injured. 
RIKER: Can we transport him out of there? 
WORF: Transporters are still offline. 
FELTON: Captain, warp power is dropping. We're losing speed. 
RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what is going on?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We lost four warp transfer conduits,
Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: The wave is gaining on us.
