troi sure counsellor favour corridor enterprise emotional condition decks

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nut
whatever it is, she's got it. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seems
our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. 
DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? 
PICARD: Forget it.

[Sickbay]

(Beverly is working in her office when Wesley calls
out to her) 
WESLEY: Hey, Mom, look what I can do. 
(She dashes into Sickbay to see him playing with his tractor beam
device) 
WESLEY: I've been able to widen and strengthen the beam, just like I
told you last night. 
CRUSHER: Do me a favour, Wes. There's something happening on this ship.
Just to be safe, I'd like you to stay in our quarters until it's
solved. 
WESLEY: Sure, Mom, sure. Your wish is my command. 
CRUSHER: Now, Wes. 
WESLEY: Okay, but you could be stunting my emotional growth, you
realise that. Why is it so hot in here, anyway? 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Crusher here. 
PICARD: Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indications
that this condition is spreading. 
CRUSHER: No test yet, Captain, but very soon.

[Corridor]

(Tasha is sashaying down the corridor, eyeing up
men, as other crew canoodle. She grabs a guy in blue and gives him a
long hard kiss) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, another forty-one minutes will see
the information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us. 
PICARD: Why so slow? 
DATA: Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating
it. 
PICARD: How much danger from that star? Worse case. 
DATA: Like a full collapse, sir? Any stellar material it threw this way
we could still outrun on half impulse power.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineer
report to the Bridge. 
(A woman marches out) 
PICARD [OC]: Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. 
(Wesley enters and offers his sweaty hand for a shake) 
WESLEY: Hi, Jim. Was that the Captain sending you to Medical? 
SHIMODA: Which would leave no one on duty here. The Chief was just
summoned to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: What about me? I could call the Chief on the Bridge if anything
happened. 
(Shimoda leaves, and Wesley looks smug)

[Bridge]

MACDOUGAL: Reporting as ordered, sir. 
PICARD: What? 
MACDOUGAL: You ordered me to report to the Bridge, sir. 
PICARD: I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine room just in
case we need to move out of here. 
PICARD [OC]: Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately,
I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain Wesley
Crusher. 
PICARD: Acting Captain? 
WESLEY [OC]: Thank you, Captain Picard, thank you. And with that order
dawns a brave new day for the Enterprise.

Captain's log, Stardate 41209.3. The strange
contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now
aboard the Enterprise and our Engineering section has been commandeered
by young Wesley Crusher.
