RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD TROI BOK

[Bridge]

RIKER: They're prepared to talk, sir. 
PICARD: Have they given any hint of what they've been waiting for? 
TASHA: Negative, Captain. They've identified their Captain as Bok.
DaiMon Bok. 
LAFORGE: You'll be able to see him now, sir. They're willing to
communicate on visual. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Ferengi vessel. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Enterprise. We are transmitting visually. 
BOK [on viewscreen]: Is this the Captain Picard? 
PICARD: Do we know each other? 
BOK [on viewscreen]: I know you, Picard. 
PICARD: Then you have the advantage. Is this Bok? 
BOK [on viewscreen]: I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi. I have asked you
here to discuss a mutual problem, Captain. 
PICARD: What problem is that, DaiMon Bok? 
BOK [on viewscreen]: I insist on speaking of that matter in person.
Shall we meet on your vessel or mine? 
(Troi signals the transmission cut) 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies closed. 
TROI: Captain, I sense considerable deception on Bok's part. And
danger. 
RIKER: Then we should meet him here. Keep him under our control. 
(Picard nods) 
TASHA: Now open, sir. 
PICARD: I appreciate your offer, DaiMon Bok. We would like you to be
our guest here. 
BOK [on viewscreen]: As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this will begin a new
era of cooperation for both our peoples. In one Earth hour, then? 
PICARD: In one hour, DaiMon Bok. End transmission. 
WORF: I can't believe they're coming here. 
PICARD: They did agree a bit easily. Well, in one hour we shall know
why.
