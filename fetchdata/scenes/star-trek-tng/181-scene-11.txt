[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(Alexander runs in and gets a hug) 
K'EHLEYR: Hello! Well, you're back early. 
ALEXANDER: He made me leave. 
K'EHLEYR: Maybe you should go to your room and play. 
(Alexander runs off) 
K'EHLEYR: Is he under arrest? 
WORF: He knows nothing of our ways! 
K'EHLEYR: Our ways? You mean Klingon ways, don't you? 
WORF: He is Klingon! 
K'EHLEYR: He is also my son and I am half-human. He will find his own
ways. Why the sudden concern? You won't even acknowledge that he's
yours. 
WORF: Why did you not tell me? 
K'EHLEYR: What would you have done? That's right. You would have
insisted that we take the oath, just as tradition would demand. 
WORF: You should not have kept this from me. 
K'EHLEYR: Well, now you know. 
WORF: I cannot acknowledge my relationship to the boy. It would only
harm him. 
K'EHLEYR: Because you were dishonoured? 
WORF: As my son, he would also bear my disgrace, as would his children.

K'EHLEYR: Why did you accept discommendation from the High Council? 
WORF: My father was accused of collaborating with the Romulans at
Khitomer. 
K'EHLEYR: I know. And I also know that you challenged it. 
WORF: Yes at first. Ultimately I withdrew my challenge. 
K'EHLEYR: But why, Worf? I can't believe you'd just give up. What
really happened? 
RIKER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.

WORF: On our way, Commander.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk holding
stations at thirteen kilometres. 
PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Data. 
DATA: Channel is open, sir. Vorn responding to hail. 
PICARD: On screen. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Let's get this over with, Picard. 
PICARD: In good time, Duras. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Even in death, K'mpec makes foolish decisions.
You should not be involved in this, human. 
PICARD: The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec's
ship. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: One hour? What is the delay? 
PICARD: There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Exactly one hour, Picard. Do not be late. 
(Worf and K'Ehleyr enter) 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Keep that pahtk away from the ceremony, Picard.
He has no place on a Klingon ship. 
PICARD: Picard out. 
PICARD: Contact Gowron's ship. Tell him to meet us aboard K'mpec's
vessel. Ambassador, meet me in Transporter room six in an hour. We will
begin the ceremony a little late. Mister Worf.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Worf, the next few days will be difficult
for you 
WORF: You have made it clear that I am to perform my regular duties,
sir. 
PICARD: I want you to know that I am aware of your discomfort. 
WORF: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Ambassador K'Ehleyr will be preparing me for my role in the
rite of succession. 
WORF: Permission to speak freely, sir? 
PICARD: Granted. 
WORF: Duras must not be allowed to lead the council. 
PICARD: He has a legal claim, Mister Worf. Your personal feelings
toward him 
WORF: It is not personal, sir. His father betrayed my people to the
Romulans. Duras is a traitor. 
PICARD: Klingon tradition may hold the son responsible for his father's
sin. I cannot, Worf. Treason was his father's crime. Duras' crime was
to lay that blame on your father. I will not forget that. But you
should not forget that you chose to accept the consequences of that
lie. 
WORF: To preserve the Empire. 
PICARD: The issue now is whether or not he killed K'mpec. 
WORF: Sir? 
PICARD: He was murdered. Poisoned. 
WORF: A Klingon would not use poison. His murder would have no honour. 
PICARD: K'mpec believed that it was either Duras or Gowron. 
WORF: Well, I know little of Gowron. Only that he is an outsider who
has often challenged the Council. But Duras? I know him. His heart is
not Klingon. 
[K'mpec's quarters]

(K'mpec's body is still sitting in his chair.
Picard and K'Ehleyr stand beside it. She is holding a painstick.) 
K'EHLEYR: That's Gowron. 
PICARD: I hope this will be brief. 
K'EHLEYR: It will be just long enough to prove that K'mpec is dead. 
(Duras enters with two guards. K'Ehleyr hands the painstick to Picard.
He stands in front of K'mpec's body) 
PICARD: Qab jIH nagil (and presses the painstick to the corpse) 
GOWRON: Qab jIH nagil! 
(he does the same with a painstick he has brought) 
DURAS: Qab jiH nagil! 
(slightly more sadistically than Gowron) 
K'EHLEYR: Sonchi. 
DURAS: Now, complete the Rite of Succession. It's obvious who the two
challengers are. 
PICARD: We will proceed according to the traditions and the precedents
set down in Klingon law. 
GOWRON: What do you know of Klingon law, human? 
PICARD: We will reconvene on the Enterprise, wherein 
DURAS: No! Finish it here, now! 
(There's an explosion, people go flying)
