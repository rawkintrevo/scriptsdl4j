[Penthara Science lab]

LAFORGE: The Enterprise will monitor the CO2
concentrations at six different altitudes. If all goes well, it
shouldn't take more than twenty bore sites. 
MOSELEY: Let's hope all goes well. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Commander Riker. How are you doing? 
RIKER: We've gotten word from the monitoring stations. They're all
online. We're ready when you are, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: That's excellent. All we need now is an open channel to Data. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Open a channel, Mister Worf, and prepare to
fire at target one. 
WORF: The computer has locked in phaser depth calculations. 
RIKER: Mister Data? 
DATA [OC]: Ready, sir. 
RIKER: Fire. 
(two shots hit the snow-covered ground)

[Engineering]

DATA: Target one is emitting two thousand cubic
metres per second. 
[Penthara Science lab]

DATA [OC]: Target two, one thousand six hundred. 
MOSELEY: Surface wind patterns over the target are stable. 
LAFORGE: You picking up anything at altitude, Data? 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: CO2 concentrations remain unchanged at
upper elevations. 
(three more phaser shots, then Rasmussen enters) 
RASMUSSEN: Have I missed much? 
WORF: Target fourteen complete, sir. 
RIKER: Data?
