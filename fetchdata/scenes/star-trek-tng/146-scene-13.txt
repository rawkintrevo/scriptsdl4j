TROI COMPUTER WORF KEHLEYR

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Myself, I think I got the worst of each. 
TROI: Oh, I doubt that. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense of humour is bad enough.
It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. 
TROI: And your Klingon side? 
K'EHLEYR: That, I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible
temper. It's not something I want people to see. 
TROI: Everyone has tempers. 
K'EHLEYR: Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of
me, fighting to get out. 
TROI: And it frightens you. 
K'EHLEYR: Of course it does. My Klingon side can be terrifying, even to
me. 
TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. 
K'EHLEYR: That doesn't mean I have to like it.

[Tactical room]

((K'Ehleyr has changed into a red leather catsuit) 
WORF: You are late. 
K'EHLEYR: Sorry. Had to make myself beautiful. 
WORF: I fail to understand why. 
K'EHLEYR: Worf, we're alone now. You don't have to act like a Klingon
glacier. I don't bite. Well, that's wrong, I do bite. 
WORF: Shall we proceed with our assigned duties? 
K'EHLEYR: You weren't this aloof six years ago. Or don't you remember? 
WORF: There is nothing wrong with my memory. 
K'EHLEYR: Well there's something wrong with the rest of you. You're not
even looking at me. 
WORF: I am familiar with your appearance. 
K'EHLEYR: And it gives you no pleasure to see me again. It isn't as if
we tried it and it didn't work, you know. You never gave it a chance. 
WORF: I never? 
K'EHLEYR: I mean, as I see it, we have some unfinished business, you
and I. 
WORF: Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the
ship's mission. 
K'EHLEYR: Probably some secret military objective. 
WORF: Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that. 
K'EHLEYR: Why else would there be no record of the mission? 
WORF: The records may simply have been lost. 
K'EHLEYR: What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible
threat. 
WORF: And to contend with that threat, we need information. 
K'EHLEYR: We have all the information we need. 
WORF: That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand
them. 
K'EHLEYR: There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll
attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that! 
WORF: And I do not appreciate being interrupted. 
K'EHLEYR: And I do not appreciate wasting my time. 
WORF: We were instructed to come up with options. 
K'EHLEYR: There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. 
WORF: There are always options. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh, are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours? 
WORF: My experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems
have more than one solution. 
K'EHLEYR: Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever. 
WORF: Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? 
K'EHLEYR: All right, I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and
careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation
stands. Meeting adjourned.

(She takes out her pent up rage on the poor
defenceless glass table. Then the doorbell rings) 
K'EHLEYR: Come. 
(Troi enters, carefully) 
TROI: You're upset. 
K'EHLEYR: Your finely-honed Betazoid sense tells you that? 
TROI: Well, that and the table. 
K'EHLEYR: I warned you about my Klingon half. 
TROI: May I make a suggestion? 
K'EHLEYR: I thank you, Counsellor. But I don't want any counseling. 
TROI: Actually, I was going to suggest something else. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh? 
TROI: I find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough to
put my mind off most frustrations. 
K'EHLEYR: And it'll keep me from wrecking the ship. 
TROI: That, too

[Corridor]

(So, in a purple striped catsuit, she prowls down
to the holodeck) 
COMPUTER: Enter programme. 
K'EHLEYR: Show me the exercise menu. Hold. Calisthenics programme of
Lieutenant Worf. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. You may enter when ready.

(She enters, picks up the armoured glove and gets
on with it)
