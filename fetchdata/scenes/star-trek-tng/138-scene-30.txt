PICARD RIKER DATA WORF WESLEY

[Lobby]

RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trapped
here. We're in no immediate danger

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: But I am concerned. 
PICARD: Something about your location is interfering with
communication. We are working on the problem. 
RIKER [OC]: Standing by, sir. 
WESLEY: Captain, these frequencies are unstable. 
PICARD: Then find others. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: What is going on down there?

[Lobby]

DATA: Commander, I am picking up something most
unusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be human
DNA. 
RIKER: Where? 
DATA: Thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us. 
WORF: Perhaps those turbolifts could take us there. 
(Of course, the doors don't open automatically for them) 
WORF: Seems to be malfunctioning. 
(Data presses the button)

[Hotel corridor]

DATA: The reading I received is from behind this
door, sir. 
(Riker knocks, then Worf opens the door and they enter) 

[Hotel room]

DATA: My reading is intensifying, sir. 
RIKER: Are you getting any life signs? 
DATA: None, sir. 
(Riker pulls back the bedsheet to reveal the desiccated remains of a
person, mostly skeleton with some remaining skin) 
DATA: Definitely human. Male. 
RIKER: Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. 
WORF: What a terrible way to die. 
DATA: He has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years, sir. The
lack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. 
(Worf opens the wardrobe) 
RIKER: Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just window
dressing for a dead man. 
WORF: Commander. 
DATA: Is this significant, sir? 
(It's a spacesuit on a hangar) 
RIKER: American. 
DATA: Fifty two stars sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD. It
correlates with the debris we found. Colonel S. Richey. Rest in peace,
Colonel. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER: Finally. Riker. Go ahead.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: You're coming through clearly now. 
PICARD: What's your situation? 
[Hotel room]

RIKER: This structure was apparently made to
resemble twentieth century Earth. All efforts to exit have failed. 
PICARD [OC]: We haven't found a way to transport you back yet. 
RIKER: I assumed as much, sir. We've also located the remains of a
human. Request identity scan. Colonel Richey. American. First initial
S. Roughly the same time period.
