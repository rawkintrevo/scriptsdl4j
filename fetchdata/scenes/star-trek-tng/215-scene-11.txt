PICARD: The same conditions won't permit a shuttle
to land safely, Mister LaForge. Any suggestions? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Give us a minute, Captain. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Sir, let me beam down with a pattern
enhancer. 
LAFORGE: Chief, there's no guarantee you won't rematerialise in a
million pieces if your signal gets caught up in that electromagnetic
whirlwind. 
O'BRIEN: I can boost the confinement beam. One person might be able to
make it. 
LAFORGE: Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to beam down to the surface with
a pattern enhancer. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: His chances of getting down there
safely are no better than fifty-fifty, in my opinion. 
WORF: Captain, a major storm front is moving in on the away team's
coordinates. 
PICARD: You're aware of the risks, Mister O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Yes sir.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I think I can make it. 
PICARD [OC]: All right then. Good luck. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

[Moon surface]

RIKER: Mister O'Brien! Nice of you to join us. 
O'BRIEN: Nice spot for a picnic, sir. We need to distribute these
enhancer rods at seven metre lengths. That should do it. 
RIKER: Is this storm front going to interfere with the transport,
Chief? 
O'BRIEN: I'd really like to get us out of here before it hits,
Commander. I'm supposed to be feeding the baby lunch. Molly gets in a
terribly foul mood if I'm late. 
RIKER: I'm with you. 
(the sky is very angry) 
RIKER: Lunch time, Miles! Let's do it! 
(O'Brien goes to turn on the pattern enhancers, and gets hit by
lightning. They all fall down. Balls of light descend on them, but one
flies away from Riker, who wakes up. He activates the enhancers and
they are all beamed away)
