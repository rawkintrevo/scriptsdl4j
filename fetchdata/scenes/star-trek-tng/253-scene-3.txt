CRUSHER: Ensign, we need to modify the sensor array
to filter out these EM pulses. Can you do that? 
TAITT: (a young woman) Yes, sir. I think so. 
CRUSHER: What's your name? 
TAITT: Taitt, sir. 
CRUSHER: I don't think I've seen you before. 
TAITT: I was just posted here six weeks ago. 
CRUSHER: Well, Taitt, I'll bet you never thought you'd be serving as
Tactical Officer after only six weeks. 
TAITT: No, sir, I sure didn't. I think I've filtered out some of the
sensor noise. I'll bring the modifications online. 
CRUSHER: Good work. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: Go ahead, Will.

RIKER: I can't contact the Captain. It could just
be interference, but I'd like to be sure. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Understood.

CRUSHER: Enterprise to Captain Picard. Crusher to
Picard. 
TAITT: I'm not getting a comm. signal from anyone on the Captain's
team. 
CRUSHER: The last time they checked in they were investigating a
structure in section gamma two five. 
TAITT: Sir, I'm picking up a vessel closing in on our location. 
CRUSHER: Is it a Borg ship? 
TAITT: It seems to match the configuration of a ship the Enterprise
encountered at Ohniaka Three. 
CRUSHER: Red alert. How long before they're in weapons range? 
TAITT: Er, about ninety seconds. No, make that seventy seconds. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Transporter room three. 
SALAZAR [OC]: Salazar here, sir. 
CRUSHER: Start transporting the away teams off of the surface.
