[Observation Lounge]

RIKER: Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor from
the planet Brekka, and T'Jon and Romas from Ornara. 
PICARD: I am sorry we couldn't save your ship. 
T'JON: Tell me, you could have repaired it. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. 
T'JON: We have only two left. Neither works properly. They are critical
to our survival. Will you fix them? 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magnetic
coils the freighters depend on. Assuming the malfunction is similar,
suitable replacements can be fabricated. 
PICARD: Instruct Engineering to proceed. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
T'JON: Now, as for our cargo. 
SOBI: Our cargo, Captain. 
ROMAS: Wrong, Sobi. 
PICARD: My First Officer has said that ownership of this cargo is in
dispute, but this question must be settled by whatever legal mechanism
exists between your societies. 
T'JON: Captain, you don't understand. This is a matter of life and
death. 
PICARD: Why is that? What is this cargo? 
T'JON: Medicine. 
PICARD: Indeed? 
ROMAS: Our planet is in desperate need, Captain. We have people
suffering from a lethal plague. 
T'JON: The cargo you have impounded is the only hope of life for our
people. 
PICARD: Is that so? 
SOBI: Yes. 
LANGOR: You must think us heartless brutes, Captain, but look at our
side of it. The plant which yields the medicine felicium grows only in
remote areas of Brekka. 
SOBI: It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, purified. A
complex and expensive process. 
LANGOR: That single shipment of felicium represents an enormous
investment. We can't just give it away. 
T'JON: We paid for it. We are asking only for what is ours. 
LANGOR: That is your viewpoint. Ours, of course, differs. 
ROMAS: You are going to hold to that position? 
SOBI: I am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement. 
ROMAS: Then you condemn us to death! 
T'JON: Romas. 
ROMAS: You disgust me! If you could see the suffering the plague has
caused. Well, you are going to, when you see what it does to us. 
PICARD: Romas, are you and T'Jon carrying this plague? 
ROMAS: Yes. Every Ornaran does. 
PICARD: Then you may have brought it aboard this ship. Was there a
medical scan when they transported? 
RIKER: Unverified. The solar flares could have caused a malfunction in
the biofilter. 
PICARD: Med Alert. Medical emergency. Doctor Crusher to the observation
lounge at once.

(Romas is suffering on a bed) 
SOBI: You find us well, I trust? 
CRUSHER: As far as I can tell. Your physiology is somewhat different
than I've ever encountered, but I detect no dangerous virus or
bacteria. 
LANGOR: I assure you we're in perfect health. 
T'JON: But we are not. We need our medicine. 
SOBI: Our medicine. 
T'JON: We paid for it. It's ours now. 
CRUSHER: Enough! 
SOBI: Of course. You are right, Doctor. Could we leave now? 
CRUSHER: I see no reason why not. Escort them to their quarters. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Doctor. 
LANGOR: Captain, could I speak with you please? In private. 
CRUSHER: Not right now. Captain. 
[Doctor's office]

PICARD: What have you learned? 
CRUSHER: The Brekkians show no sign of infection. The Ornarans show all
the symptoms of a disease but I can't find a cause. 
PICARD: Perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter when they were
beamed aboard? 
CRUSHER: There's no record of it. Then again, the solar flare activity
might have caused a malfunction in the biofilters or their monitors. 
PICARD: Are they going to die? 
CRUSHER: I need to check further, but my instinct says no. 
PICARD: Do you think we are in danger from this plague? 
CRUSHER: Again, I need more time. 
PICARD: There are some missing pieces to this puzzle. 
CRUSHER: What's missing is a little compassion. 
PICARD: Are we losing our professional detachment, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Perhaps. But Captain, I must tell you, I'm developing a very
active dislike for these Brekkians. 
PICARD: Understandable.

[Sickbay]

T'JON: Captain, you must give us back our cargo. 
PICARD: I can't do that. 
T'JON: Why? It belongs to us. 
PICARD: The Brekkians claim it belongs to them. 
ROMAS: They lie. 
PICARD: That may be so, but it's not my decision. 
ROMAS: We need some now. Now! I don't care if it's your decision. Get
us some. 
T'JON: Captain, what is happening to us, is happening to thousands more
on Ornara. Please understand the magnitude of the problem. 
ROMAS: Your people don't need it. The Brekkians don't need it. Our
people do. 
T'JON: If you don't give it to us, you will be a party to murder, not
only of us, but of an entire civilisation. I'm sorry, I do not mean to
insult you. I'm feeling very shaky. 
ROMAS: We cannot hold out much longer. 
CRUSHER: They believe it will help them. That in itself might control
their symptoms. 
PICARD: I'll talk with the Brekkians. 
T'JON: Thank you, Captain. We appreciate anything you can do.

[Guest quarters]

(Langor and Sobi are relaxing and enjoying a drink
when the doorbell chimes. Picard enters) 
SOBI: May I say, Captain, how impressed we are with your ship and all
its facilities. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
LANGOR: And its crew. Everyone is so efficient and professional. 
PICARD: I am glad you are comfortable. I've come to seek your agreement
to an Ornaran request. 
SOBI: We cannot agree 
LANGOR: Wait. Let the Captain speak. We want to be reasonable. 
PICARD: The two Ornarans are really quite ill and insisting that they
need felicium. 
SOBI: That is not surprising. 
PICARD: Would you object to giving them enough for their own immediate
needs? 
SOBI: Captain, we Brekkians are in business. We are not in the habit of
giving away what has not been paid for. 
PICARD: You would see them die rather than share the medicine? 
LANGOR: We want to be fair, Captain. We agree to permitting them two
dosages for immediate use. 
SOBI: No charge. 
PICARD: I'll let my Medical Officer handle it. 
LANGOR: Captain, I trust you won't mind if we're present while you open
the cargo.
