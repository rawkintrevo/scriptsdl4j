[Jungle]

TASHA: He can't answer you, Captain. 
DATA: Commander Riker just has been encased in some kind of energy
field. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Is he alive? 
[Jungle]

DATA: Unknown.

Captain's log, supplemental. Some kind of weapon,
which for a time took the form of Captain Paul Rice, has enveloped
Commander Riker.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room three, have you been able
to lock on to the away team? 
CHIEF [OC]: I am unable to lock on to Commander Riker, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign T'Su, situation report. 
T'SU: Previous energy readings are gone. 
PICARD: Data, have you been able to assess Commander Riker's condition?

DATA [OC]: He appears to be in some kind of stasis. 
PICARD: Theorise, Mister Data. What would be the purpose of such an
encasement? 
[Jungle]

DATA: Typically, the purpose of such an enclosure
is for storage. 
PICARD [OC]: Which would suggest what? 
TASHA: That sooner or later someone or something will be along to
collect him. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by. I'm coming down. 
TROI: You, sir? 
PICARD: Yes. Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. Meet me in
Transporter room three. Mister La Forge, you have command of the
Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: And whatever happens down there, your prime responsibility is
to the ship. 
LAFORGE: Understood, sir. 
TROI: Captain, I take great exception to your decision to beam down. 
PICARD: Noted.

[Transporter room]

CRUSHER: Is it just Riker? 
PICARD: Yes. Apparently he's confined in some sort of force field.
Energise.
