STUBBS: No cracks in the armour. We'll do just
fine. 
WESLEY: How can you be so calm about this? If I was about to make this
kind of breakthrough 
STUBBS: I have never doubted for a moment that this day would come,
Wesley. And I suspect that some day it will come for you as well. I see
a lot of me in you. In my youth, they called me a vunderkind. Do you
understand vunderkind? 
WESLEY: It's German, isn't it? 
STUBBS: It means wonder child. It is reserved for those of us who
achieve early in life. Now the burden is yours. 
WESLEY: Burden? 
STUBBS: To fulfill your potential. You will never come up against a
greater adversary than your own potential, my young friend. 
WESLEY: Red Alert. Return to quarters immediately.

PICARD: Still no visual contact. That's impossible.
Mister Worf, same magnification fifty degrees starboard. 
RIKER: Worf, you're absolutely sure? 
WORF: Sensors clearly indicate the approach of a Borg vessel. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
WORF: Shields are not responding. 
LAFORGE: Manual override is jammed. It's not going to work this time.
We don't have the shields, Captain. 
WORF: Captain, they're firing energy weapons at us. 
PICARD: Evasive action. 
RIKER: Bring her round to two seven five mark three. 
PICARD: Predict current vector of Borg ship. 
WORF: Vector. Is gone. And so is the Borg vessel. 
PICARD: You're telling me this is another computer glitch? 
DATA: It is conceivable that he was viewing a synthetically generated
image, sir. 
RIKER: That our computer was daydreaming? 
(The ship shakes and the doors start opening and closing rapidly) 
PICARD: Computer, identify malfunction immediately. 
COMPUTER: Pawn to Bishop Four. Knight to King's Rook Three. Bishop to
Queen's Bishop Four. Knight to Knight Five. Queen's Knight to King Two.

DATA: Controls are not responding, sir. 
COMPUTER: Queen to Bishop Three. Bishop to Bishop Two. LAFORGE: Impulse
engines are down. 
RIKER: Try warp engines. 
LAFORGE: No. Sorry, Commander. I'd better get back to Engineering 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, I want Lieutenant Worf to accompany you. Get
me a full report on the prospects of getting our shields back. Number
One, Mister Data, will you join me in the conference room as soon as
possible. It's time to discuss the future of this mission, if there
still is one.
