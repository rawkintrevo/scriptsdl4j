[Transporter room]

KEIKO JR: I've got the phasers, Captain. 
(the pair leave just before the Ferengi comes back round the corner
carrying the toy and tries to make it work)

[Jefferies tube]

RO JR: This is the first time these Jefferies tubes
haven't seemed cramped. 
GUINAN JR:: How much farther do we have to go? 
RO JR: About fifty metres. Don't tell me you're tired. 
GUINAN JR: I'm not as young as I used to be.

[Crusher's office]

(Alexander knocks on the glass and runs away. The
Ferengi gives chase) 
[Sickbay]

(Alexander gets some hypos from a drawer)

[Jefferies tube]

(the girls climb down a short ladder) 
RO JR: This is it. Main Engineering. Now we wait.

[School room]

(Alexander returns) 
PICARD JR: Report? 
ALEXANDER: Mission accomplished, sir. The one in sickbay never saw me. 
PICARD JR: Very good. 
KEIKO JR: I'd say we're ready. Have you figured out how to get to the
Bridge? 
PICARD JR:: I'm afraid I can only think of one way. 
[Corridor]

BERIK: What do you want? 
PICARD JR: I need to see my father. 
BERIK: Go back inside. 
PICARD JR: I need to see him right now. 
BERIK: Do not argue with me. Go back inside. 
PICARD JR: I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!
Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! I want my father! 
BERIK: All right. Just stop that.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD JR: Let me go! 
BERIK: Here he is. Now be quiet! 
RIKER: What is going on? 
PICARD JR: Dad! 
(and throws his arms around Riker's waist) 
RIKER: So, son, how are you? 
PICARD JR: I'm okay. 
RIKER: And how are your friends, Keiko, Guinan and Ro? 
PICARD JR: They're okay too. But 
RIKER: What's wrong? 
PICARD JR: We don't have anything to do. None of the games are working.

RIKER: I know. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer. 
PICARD JR: Can't you just turn on the kid's computer in schoolroom
eight? We just want to play a few games. 
RIKER: I don't know if they'll let me do that, Jean-Luc, but I will
ask. 
PICARD JR: Thanks, Number One. He's my number one Dad.
