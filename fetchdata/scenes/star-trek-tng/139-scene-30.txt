TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI P

[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Just surrounded my patient. 
PICARD [OC]: Is he still alive? 
PULASKI: Yes 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Arm the photons, Mister Worf. Lock on the
centre of the vortex. 
WORF: Photon torpedoes locked on target. 
PICARD: Hold for my order. 
(Picard gets zapped again and thrown against a bulkhead) 
RIKER: Like a rag in a dog's mouth. 
LAFORGE: I am now at maximum warp. 
TROI: It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has focused
its attention entirely on you. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I can't hold it any longer. If we don't shut down
right now, we are going 
PICARD: Hold this position. Counsellor, if I were to leave the
Enterprise, would its attention still be focused on me? 
TROI: Yes. I think it would. 
RIKER: You'd never survive. 
PICARD: But in those few seconds, the Enterprise might break free.
That's what he, that's what the other Picard must have thought. 
RIKER: Captain, where are you going? 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: You're leaving the ship? 
PICARD: We may be on a road that has no turns.

[Sickbay]

(Troi has got to Sickbay before Picard) 
PULASKI: He's very agitated. 
P2: I must get to the shuttle. 
PICARD: I know. Do you know where you are? 
P2: The Enterprise. 
PICARD: Yes, but you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you know
who I am? No, you don't, do you. 
P2: I must go. 
PICARD: Release him. 
PULASKI: Do you know what you are doing? 
PICARD: No. Release him. 
PULASKI: Security to Sickbay. 
PICARD: No. Security, disregard that order, and clear all personnel,
repeat, all personnel, from Shuttlebay two. 
(Picard 2 gets up) 
PICARD: I don't want any distractions. You, stay here.

[Corridor]

PICARD: You made a decision to leave the ship? 
P2: I must. 
PICARD: Why? 
P2: The energy in the vortex wants me. 
PICARD: You're certain. 
P2: Yes. It's an entity, a life form, which recognises the Enterprise
as an entity with me as its brain. And it wants me.
