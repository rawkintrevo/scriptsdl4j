[Klingon quarters]

DATA: These quarters were obviously intended for
one crewmember, sir. There is but a single sleeping space.
PICARD: I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in here
together.
DATA: Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.
PICARD: Very well, Mister Data. Thank you.
(Picard lies down on the metal shelf with a bulkhead only just above
his head) 
DATA: Are you comfortable, sir?
PICARD: I suppose so.
DATA: Good night, Captain. Sleep well, sir.
PICARD: Thank you.
PICARD: What are you doing?
DATA: Sir? Was I making noise, sir?
PICARD: No, not exactly 
DATA: I was processing all of the information we have accumulated on
Romulan society. I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.
PICARD: I see.
DATA: Would you like me to discontinue, sir?
PICARD: No. Please go on.
PICARD: What are you looking at?
DATA: I am not looking at anything, sir. I am continuing to organise my
files.
PICARD: But you're looking at me.
DATA: I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir. I will not look in your
direction.
(Data turns around, Picard gives up and gets up) 
DATA: Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
PICARD: I don't think so, Mister Data. Let's go on with the files. 
DATA: I would be happy to. I have been studying the Krocton segment, as
you asked, and have selected an appropriate site for our transport. 
K'VADA [OC]: Captain K'Vada to Picard. Please come to the bridge.

[Klingon Bridge]

K'VADA: Captain. We've monitored a subspace message
that might interest you.
(Picard reads the PADD) 
PICARD: Sarek is dead.
