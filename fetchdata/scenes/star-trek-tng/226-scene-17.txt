DATA: It is built into my positronic decompiler. It
will be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. 
PICARD: (hesitation) Proceed, Mister Data.

RIKER: Mister Data. 
DATA: Sir. 
LAFORGE: Let me give you a hand with that, Data. 
(Geordi works with a device Data has brought) 
DATA: Once I have adjusted the forcefield, I will no longer be visible,
Commander. I have taken steps, however, to ensure that you will still
be able to hear me. If you would assist me in a test of the comm.
system. My voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phase
adjustment. That should allow me to maintain verbal contact. 
RIKER: Will we be able to talk to you? 
DATA: No, sir. That will not be possible. 
LAFORGE: The subspace field has been established. You're set to go,
Data. 
DATA: Adjusting the synchronic distortion. Point zero zero one. Point
zero zero two. (fades out) Point zero zero three. Point zero zero four.

DATA [OC]: I have made visual contact. There are lifeforms here.

DATA [OC]: They're either unaware of me or choosing
to ignore me. I am moving approximately ten metres north of my starting
position to observe more closely.

DATA [OC]: They range from two to three metres in
height. Silver grey in colour. They have four limbs. No eyes or ears
are noticeable. There is a single orifice where a humanoid forehead
would ordinarily be. They are reclined against the
rock face surrounding an apparatus of some sort approximately one point
five metres in height.
