PICARD SHIPLEY DATA LAFORGE

[Alien lab]

(An alien returns to Riker and scans him then
shuffles off again. The emitter starts beeping)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Captain, I've located the homing signal.
Locking onto it now. It's coming from a subspace energy level of
sixteen point two keV. 
PICARD: Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. 
SHIPLEY: Graviton emitters at full power, sir. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, how much time? 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: At the present rate, containment failure will
occur in approximately nine minutes.

[Alien lab]

(The alien removes Riker's head restraint)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: Captain, the containment field is beginning
to fluctuate. Failure anticipated in 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: Three minutes, eleven seconds. 
PICARD: We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. 
LAFORGE: Initiating pulse now.

[Alien lab]

(a bright hole appears in the wall. The alien
rushes to confer with a colleague)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse is
having an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent.

(the light gets brighter) 
DATA: Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They are
reinforcing the tetryon emissions. They appear to be counter-acting the
graviton pulse.
