ANTICAN RIKER LAFORGE TASHA PICARD GEORDI CRUSHER

[Sensor Maintenance]

(Worf goes over to a wall panel, and puts his pen
device on it. Blue energy goes up his arm and he cries out. Then he is
flung back to the floor) 
LAFORGE: Worf! La Forge to Sickbay. We havd a medical emergency in
sensor maintenance. I repeat, this is a medical emergency. 
(after the titles, Crusher and a medic dash in) 
CRUSHER: What happened? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. He got hit by some sensor feedback, maybe. 
(Worf suddenly wakes up and starts fighting the medic. Geordi lies
across him so Crusher can inject him) 
LAFORGE: You got it, Doc? 
CRUSHER: I got it. Lieutenant Worf, can you hear what I'm saying? Let's
get him up. 
GEORDI: Okay. Come on, big guy. On your feet. Here we go. That's it. 
CRUSHER: (to medic) Are you okay?

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: He was just monitoring the sensor console
when he jerked as though something hit him. What my sensors showed was
a glow, just for a second. I can't explain it. 
PICARD: Could your Visor device have malfunctioned? 
LAFORGE: I doubt it, sir. It seemed what I was seeing was something
real.

[Antican quarters]

(The Anticans have long white eyebrows, and white
facial hair, and have sharp teeth like a mongoose) 
TASHA: Sorry to call you, sir. Not strictly security. It's about the
dietary requirements of the Antican delegates. 
RIKER: I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha. 
TASHA: So did we, sir. Their live animals were beamed aboard. We were
going to preserve the meat for them, but they say we must bring it to
them alive. 
RIKER: Then do so. Lieutenant Yar was confused. We no longer enslave
animals for food purposes. 
ANTICAN: But we have seen humans eat meat. 
RIKER: You've seen something as fresh and tasty as meat, but
inorganically materialised out of patterns used by our transporters. 
ANTICAN: This is sickening. It's barbaric.
