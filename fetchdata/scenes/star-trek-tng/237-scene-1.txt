Captain's log, stardate 46360.8. The negotiations
with the Cardassians have made little progress. I believe a military
confrontation may be unavoidable.

JELLICO: Gul Lemec, I assure you that what the
Federation wants above all, is the preservation of peace. 
LEMEC: Then how do you explain the fact that a Federation team launched
an unprovoked assault on Cardassian territory less than fourteen hours
ago? 
JELLICO: I don't know what you're talking about. 
LEMEC: Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Worf,
and Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on Celtris Three, attacked one of our
outposts in a brutal assault, and killed over fifty five men, women and
children. 
JELLICO: What evidence do you have of that? 
LEMEC: We have all the evidence we need. We have Captain Picard. 
RIKER: Is he alive? 
LEMEC: The Cardassian Union has yet to decided how it will respond to
this latest provocation. But rest assured, we will respond. 
(the Cardassians leave) 
RIKER: Is there any truth in what he's saying? 
JELLICO: Captain Picard and the others were sent to investigate reports
of a metagenic weapon on Celtris Three. It's possible that they may
have been captured. But if they did escape, they'll head for the Lyshan
system. The Enterprise is supposed to meet them there in eight hours.
Will, I want you to take a shuttlecraft and head for the rendezvous
point. The Enterprise will have to remain here until the endgame with
Gul Lemec is played out. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.
