[Ten forward]

(Riker is socialising with a young woman) 
RIKER: Seeing the look on his face. I'll get you another drink. (goes
to the bar) Two more. 
(Wesley enters and gestures that he wants a word) 
RIKER: Thank you. 
(Riker takes the drinks to his table and makes his excuses) 
RIKER: Family emergency. (goes to Wesley's table) You don't look like a
person who came here to relax. 
WESLEY: I didn't. I need your advice. Yesterday, when Ensign Davies
turned in his geological survey, I asked him to run an ico-spectrogram.
He didn't agree. 
RIKER: Do you think you were right? 
WESLEY: Yes. I guess. I could have just been picking nits. 
RIKER: Or you could have been intimidated. It's tough to tell other
people what to do. 
WESLEY: I suppose I could have made it an order, but how do you give
orders to somebody older and more experienced then you? 
RIKER: The difference in ages between you and Davies is not the issue
here. 
WESLEY: I guess not. 
RIKER: Do you think it might have something to do with ego? 
WESLEY: No, it's just the opposite of ego. Every time I try to give an
order, something inside me says, what makes my judgment so superior to
these people's? 
RIKER: Wes, responsibility and authority go hand in hand. I know you're
responsible, now we've got to teach you a little bit of authority. One
of the reasons you've been given command is so you can make a few right
decisions, that will establish a pattern of success and help build
self-confidence. If you don't trust your own judgment, you don't belong
in the command chair. 
WESLEY: But what if I'm wrong? 
RIKER: Then you're wrong. It's arrogant to think you'll never make a
mistake. 
WESLEY: But what if it's something really important. I mean, not just a
mineral survey. What if someone dies because I made a mistake? 
RIKER: In your position, it's important to ask yourself one question.
What would Picard do? 
WESLEY: He'd listen to everyone's opinion, then make his own decision.
But he's Captain Picard. 
RIKER: Well it doesn't matter. Once Picard makes his decision, does
anyone question it? 
WESLEY: No way. 
RIKER: And why not? 
WESLEY: I'm not sure. 
DATA [OC]: Commander Riker, report to the Captain's quarters. 
RIKER: When you figure it out, you'll understand command. I'm on my
way. I hope I've been able to help. You let me know what you decide? 
WESLEY: I've made my decision. I'm going to have Davies run that
ico-gram. Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: You're welcome. (in his date's ear) I'll see you later) 
WOMAN: Okay.
