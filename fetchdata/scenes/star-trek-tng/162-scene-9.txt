RIKER OBRIEN LAFORGE WORF PICARD DATA

[Bridge]

(And the orbiting research station goes Big Bang!) 
PICARD: Transporter Room! Is Commander Riker aboard? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Not yet, Captain. I'm having trouble clearing the signal 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Transporter Room to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: He's aboard. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: Why do you sound so surprised, Mister
O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN: For a moment, we weren't sure you left the space station in
time. 
RIKER: In time for what? 
O'BRIEN: It just exploded, sir.

Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker has
informed me that Doctor Apgar was the only one aboard the space station
when it exploded. We remain in orbit investigating the accident. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I've gone through the whole system,
Captain. I can't find any malfunction in the transporter.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN [OC]: Nothing that would cause an explosion
like that 
PICARD: Why was there a power drain before
transport? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: I don't know, sir. 
PICARD: I shall want an answer to that. I'm sure the Tanugans will too.

O'BRIEN [OC]: Yes, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the radiation and debris are consistent with an overload
of the station's reactor core. 
PICARD: Were there any indications of reactor core problems while you
were on the station? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. 
PICARD: Number One? Mister La Forge indicated that this was not an
entirely routine mission. 
RIKER: It's a long story, sir, but I'm sure it doesn't have anything to
do with this accident. 
WORF: Captain, Chief Investigator Krag of the Tanugan security force
requests permission to beam aboard. 
PICARD: Granted. Will you escort him to the Bridge, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Perhaps you had tell me as much as possible prior to his
arrival, Number One.

[Transporter room]

(A humanoid male, hair swept up at the sides to
give a severe look) 
WORF: I'm Lieutenant Worf, head of ship's Security. I will take you to
the Captain.
