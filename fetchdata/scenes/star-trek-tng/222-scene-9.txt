PICARD [OC]: Report. 
LAFORGE: Could be something wrong with the shields, Captain. We're
checking it out now. 
SUTTER: Systems are normal, sir. 
LAFORGE: So did we hit something or not? Shields say yes, sensors say
no. This is very strange. Ensign, give me a breakdown on shield energy
conversion and then run a spectral. (nearly steps on Clara) Whoa. Where
did you come from? 
CLARA: I'm Clara Sutter. That's my daddy. 
SUTTER: Clara, you can't be here right now. 
CLARA: But Isabella wanted to see Engineering. 
SUTTER: I don't care what Isabella wanted to see, you go back to our
quarters right now. 
CLARA: But Daddy 
PICARD [OC]: Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. 
LAFORGE: I hear you, Captain. I'm increasing the power to the impulse
engines, but forward velocity just isn't consistent with engine output.

PICARD [OC]: Explanation. 
LAFORGE: It seems like there's something increasing the drag
coefficient on the ship. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: But we can't find the source. 
PICARD: If we can't correct it we may have to reverse course and leave
the nebula. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Give me a couple of minutes here, Captain.

SUTTER: Clara, now. 
(Clara leaves) 
SUTTER: I'm sorry, Commander.
