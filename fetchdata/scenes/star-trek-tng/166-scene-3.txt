[Ready room]

PICARD 2: Number One, you know I like to keep you
well informed as to the nature of our missions. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
PICARD 2: And if I don't inform you there is a reason. I don't like
keeping you in the dark, but for the next few days I may not be able to
be as communicative as usual. It may make things difficult for you. 
RIKER: Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it. 
PICARD 2: And the crew? 
RIKER: You can count on all of us, sir. 
PICARD 2: I appreciate that, Number One.

[Holding cell]

(Picard is tapping on the panel, 2 taps, then 3,
then 5, and so on) 
GUEST2: Picard, what are you doing? 
PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possess
intelligence. 
GUEST2: You don't think they already know that? They can hear us
talking. 
PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating through
language. 
GUEST3: Captain Picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by
tapping out the first six prime numbers. 
GUEST2: I know what he's doing. I'm trying to understand why. 
PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, find
out what they want. 
GUEST2: Obviously, they want us. 
PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makes
us special? 
GUEST3: I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I am just one
cadet. 
PICARD: What's your best area of study? 
GUEST3: Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. 
PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? 
GUEST3: I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why
didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? 
PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy
truce with the Moropa, are they not? 
GUEST3: That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology and,
even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with either of
you? 
GUEST2: I've never even heard of the Moropa. My race has no enemies. 
PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, your
planet has been conquered six times! 
GUEST2: And we've survived by not resisting. Mizarians value peace above
confrontation. 
PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. 
GUEST2: No. I don't know of anyone who bears malice toward my race. 
PICARD: Or against you personally? 
GUEST2: You can't mean to suggest that someone with a personal grudge
against me has gone to all this trouble. 
PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up with
some explanation for your abduction. 
GUEST2: I'm sorry, Picard. I can't give you one. I am neither important
enough to hold for ransom nor radical enough to be dangerous. I'm a
simple public servant. 
PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl 
(There's a sound and a sparkling, and a figure in leather appears on
the fourth bed. He has lots of red hair and sharp teeth, and pulls a
dagger) 
PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. We
are not the enemy. 
GUEST1: Who has done this? 
PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Our
captors refuse to show themselves. 
GUEST1: I don't trust you. 
PICARD: You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Were
you abducted from Chalna? 
GUEST1: You know my planet? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. I visited there twelve years ago, while commanding the
Stargazer.
