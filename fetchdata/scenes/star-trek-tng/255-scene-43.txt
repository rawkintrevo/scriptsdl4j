SILVA DATA LAFORGE WORF RIKER

[Raman Auxiliary control]

SILVA: We're running out of time. 
LAFORGE: Shields back online. We're starting our descent. Thank God. 
SILVA: Thank God? 
LAFORGE: That you're alive. That I was right about all of this. I can't
wait to call Dad. He and Ariana had given up. 
SILVA: We're going home. 
LAFORGE: Well, eventually, yeah. Data, everything's fading in and out.

[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: I'm losing the interface. 
DATA: The probe is descending out of range. 
LAFORGE: You'll have to turn up the input gain to maintain my
connection. 
DATA: We are already at seventy five percent of tolerance. 
LAFORGE: Data, you can turn it all the way up to a hundred if you
increase it slowly enough. Give my nervous system chance to adjust. 
DATA: That is theoretically true, but even at this level of input you
are already experiencing dangerous neural feedback. 
LAFORGE: There are over three hundred people on board the Hera, Data.
You and I are the only chance they've got. 
DATA: I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: It's working.

[Laboratory]

DATA: When we are ready to disconnect the
interface, we must allow enough time to lower the input levels,
otherwise your nervous system will go into shock from the sudden drop
in input.

LAFORGE: Once I initiate the warp cascade we can
start dropping the gain. 
DATA [OC]: Understood. 
LAFORGE: We'll be in sensor range of the Hera within a few minutes.
Mom, I'm really sorry I didn't by to see you a few weeks ago. 
SILVA: You were too busy with work. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, the Raman is descending toward the
planet. 
RIKER: Geordi.
