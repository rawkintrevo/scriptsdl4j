PICARD: Number One, kindly take charge of our
guests until we have time to decide what we're going to do with them. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, keep them out of my way. 
[Guest lounge]

(The three resurrected people are dressed and
trying to pay attention) 
RIKER: I know this is all very confusing to you so I'll attempt to
explain. You are on the starship USS Enterprise. 
GUEST1: American? 
RIKER: No, it's a vessel of the United Federation of Planets, and Earth
is a member. 
GUEST1: What year is this? 
DATA: By your calendar two thousand three hundred sixty four. 
GUEST1: What? My heart, is it? 
CRUSHER: It's perfectly fine. In fact, you are all now in excellent
health. 
GUEST1: It worked. I made it. 
GUEST3: (a down-home country boy, y'all) What is that? 
RIKER: An android. 
GUEST3: You mean a robot? 
DATA: Actually there is a distinct difference between an android and a
robot. 
GUEST0: And him? The one I saw before, with the head? 
CRUSHER: She means Worf. 
RIKER: He's a Klingon. That takes a little more explanation. 
GUEST3: Now, listen, guys. I paid some idiot a lot of money to freeze me
when I died, and I just got to hear the words. Am I alive? 
RIKER: Oh, yes. Absolutely. 
GUEST3: And the liver that was about to explode in my face? 
CRUSHER: Perfectly sound. 
GUEST0: Excuse me, could someone please tell me what's going on here? 
CRUSHER: About three hundred and seventy years ago, you died of a
massive embolism. 
GUEST0: I don't remember anything about that. 
CRUSHER: You and the others were frozen. 
GUEST3: Cryonics. You know, freeze you now and heal you later. 
GUEST0: Yeah, I've heard of it. I just never gave it much thought. How
did we get here? 
DATA: You were in a space module. 
GUEST3: The whacko who sold me this scam said that by putting us in
orbit there weren't gonna be no chance of a brown out. 
GUEST1: Yes, several cryonics companies fell into disrepute because of
power failures which adversely affected their refrigeration system.
Their stocks were severely depressed. 
GUEST3: The whole deal was a long shot but I figured what the hell,
might as well give them the dough instead of leaving it to my ex-wives.
But you know, son, I figured it was all just a bunch of hooey. 
DATA: Hooey? Ah, as in hogwash, malarky, jive. An intentional
fabrication. 
GUEST3: There you go, now you got it. 
RIKER: Now, if you didn't contract for this, who did? 
GUEST0: It must have been my husband, Donald. If it was new and foolish,
he would have popped for it. Well, I'll say this for it. It's the first
thing he's ever bought into that worked. 
GUEST1: I, for one, never had a doubt. My stock in this company must
have split at least a dozen times by now. 
DATA: Actually, the process of cryonics was never more than a fad, and
did not continue much beyond the mid-twenty first century. 
GUEST1: I need to make a phone call as soon as possible. 
RIKER: A phone call? 
GUEST1: Yes. I have provided for myself. I have a substantial portfolio.
It's critical that I check on it. Let the bank know that I am alive and
well. 
RIKER: Ah, that's going to be a little difficult right at the moment. 
GUEST1: Well, do you at least have a copy of The Wall Street Journal? 
RIKER: I think we should take the Doctor's advice. Take this very
slowly until we've all adjusted, and then we'll talk to the Captain.
