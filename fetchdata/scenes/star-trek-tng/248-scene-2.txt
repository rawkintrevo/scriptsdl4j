account sure don scientific doctor ferengi attitude opportunity tried

[Corridor]

REYGA: This is an opportunity I would never have
had without you, and I promise you, I'll never forget it. 
CRUSHER: Some of the scientists still seem a little doubtful, but after
the demonstration I'm sure they'll come around. 
REYGA: Well, if there's anything I'm used to, it's scepticism. After
all, a Ferengi scientist is almost a contradiction in terms. No, don't
deny it. I know how the Ferengi are regarded. 
CRUSHER: I still expect the scientific community to be a little more
open than they seem to be. 
REYGA: The metaphasic shield is a breakthrough in technology. Many
scientists have tried to develop it. It's only natural that there would
be some resistance. 
CRUSHER: You mean jealousy. I know. I wondered if that might account
for Doctor T'Pan's attitude. She's been working on subspace shielding
technology for years and you've beaten her to the punch. 
REYGA: I'm really not interested in competition. All I want is to be
acknowledged. Respected as a scientist. This invention will finally do
that. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I figured the hard part was over. I'd stepped out on a
limb and it hadn't broken.
