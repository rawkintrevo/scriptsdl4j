PICARD TROI CRUSHER MANHEIM DATA

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I wish I could talk to you, Professor
Manheim. I bet you were really something. 
(Troi enters) 
CRUSHER: Deanna. 
TROI: I wanted to see how he was doing. 
CRUSHER: The same. Nothing I do seems to make any difference. That's
not why you're here. 
TROI: I thought I was the empath.

[Doctor's Office]

TROI: Are you all right? 
CRUSHER: Why wouldn't I be? I've got one of the medical wonders of the
galaxy dying in my sickbay. 
TROI: That's not what I meant. 
CRUSHER: I don't think I want to talk about what I think you mean. 
TROI: Captain Picard 
CRUSHER: I can't compete with a ghost from his past. No one could. 
TROI: She's not a ghost. She's here right now. 
CRUSHER: She may be in the here and now, but it's the ghost he sees.
Excuse me, I have to get back to my patient.

PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? 
DATA: If Doctor Manheim's information is correct, by my calculations,
the next time distortion should occur between twenty eight to forty
seven minutes. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Bridge, this is Sickbay. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Doctor Manheim is awake and asking to
speak with you, Captain. Alone. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: On my way, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD: You asked for me. 
MANHEIM: I am not sure I remembered all of the codes for the security
system. You should warn anyone going down there 
PICARD: Thank you. I'll tell them to be cautious. 
MANHEIM: What I really wanted to talk to you about is Jenice. 
PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I did not come here to discuss your wife. 
MANHEIM: It is only this. If anything should go wrong, please, take
care of her for me. 
PICARD: Of course. 
MANHEIM: She never would admit this, but she has had a terrible time
these last years. Had we not been so isolated, she might have left me,
and I never would have known. At least, not right away. Perhaps I'm not
a man who should have a woman like her. She deserves better. 
PICARD: You underestimate her. I know, because I once did.
