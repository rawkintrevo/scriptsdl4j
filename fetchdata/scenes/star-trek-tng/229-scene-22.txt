[Ten Forward]

RIKER: Ambassador? We've received word from the
Seronian and the Rekag delegates. They've agreed to meet with you in
Darthen tomorrow.
ALKAR: Thank you, Commander. 
(Riker walks away, and Troi sashays into the room. Long tight low-cut
dress and streaked hair up.) 
DATA: Counsellor Troi has altered her appearance.
(She goes over to Alkar's table) 
TROI: Am I interrupting?
LIVA: Hello, Counsellor.
TROI: You want him. I can tell. But you have nothing to give him.
ALKAR: Deanna, could I talk to you in private.
TROI: And you. You're envious of him. You pretend to support him, but
secretly you want him to fail.
JARTH: That's not so.
ALKAR: Please, you must return to your quarters.
TROI: I won't. I want to be here, with you.
RIKER: Ambassador, the Counsellor and I are needed on the Bridge.
ALKAR: Of course, Commander.

[Corridor]

RIKER: I don't know what you thought you were doing
in there, but you were way out of line. 
[Turbolift]

RIKER: Deck nine. 
[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: All right, Deanna, just what the hell is all
this?
TROI: Imzadi, do you still care about me?
RIKER: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's all
this?
TROI: Don't you think I'm attractive?
RIKER: This just isn't you.
TROI: Oh, it is. You want me, don't you?
(she pulls him in for a kiss) 
RIKER: Deanna.
TROI: I need you.
(Her long nails scratch his neck, drawing blood) 
RIKER: What is this?
TROI: Please! 
(Next morning, Troi is in uniform when the doorbell rings) 
TROI: Come in.
ALKAR: Deanna, I'm leaving for the surface.
(She turns to us, showing her grey hair and lined face) 
TROI: You said you'd take me with you.
ALKAR: I know, but that's not possible now.
TROI: You told me I'd be helpful. You needed me.
ALKAR: And I still do. You've done so much for me.
TROI: Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you?
ALKAR: She's been on Seronia for weeks. She knows the people, the
situation.
TROI: She wants to take you away from me.
ALKAR: Deanna, you are my anchor. I need you more than you can possibly
realise. Do you understand that? I need you here, making it possible
for me to do my work.
TROI: I won't let her have you! I'll stop her! (she follows him into
the corridor) I will go with you. Take me with you. Please, Alkar.
Don't leave me. Don't do this! No!
