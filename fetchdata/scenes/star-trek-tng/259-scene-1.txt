[Ten Forward]

LWAXANA: (in brown, almost drab for her) I don't
know what they'd have done without me. First, I had to learn how they
communicate. It was an absolutely exhausting process. 
PICARD: It must have been. 
LWAXANA: Quite different from Betazed telepathy. We transmit words.
With the Cairn, it's images. A flood of them all at the same time. It's
overwhelming. 
PICARD: I can imagine. 
LWAXANA: Actually it's a very efficient way of communicating. If two
Cairn were having this conversation it would have been over minutes
ago. 
PICARD: Really? 
LWAXANA: Of course, they realise that they'll want to communicate
verbally if they join the Federation. Do me a favour. Introduce
yourself to one of them. Engage him in conversation. They need the
practice. 
PICARD: I'd be happy to. 
LAFORGE: It's called a visor. It enables me to see. 
GUEST1: (a little girl) Like my vocal enhancer. It helps me make
sounds. 
LWAXANA: I see you've already met my star pupil. Hedril's picked up
spoken language much faster than the others. 
DATA: It is often the case that children learn languages more easily
than adults. 
LWAXANA: Deanna was quite good at languages when she was little. Where
is Deanna? 
LAFORGE: Well, she must be here somewhere. 
LWAXANA: Hedril, darling. 
(Lwaxana has what looks like a dizzy turn) 
GUEST1: What? 
LWAXANA: Go find your father, dear. I want to talk to him. 
DATA: Mrs Troi? 
LWAXANA: Yes yes just a little tired. This constant telepathy with the
Cairn. I'm fine, really. Aren't you going to mingle, Mister Woof? 
WORF: I do not care for telepaths. They make me uneasy. 
LWAXANA: Don't worry. The Cairn couldn't read your thoughts even if
they wanted to. Your brain isn't sophisticated enough. (to Riker)
Neither is yours, dear. They can only communicate with other telepaths.
Have either of you seen Deanna? 
RIKER: She was working, but she said she would be (doors open) Speak of
the devil. 
TROI: Sorry I'm late. I lost track of the time. 
LWAXANA: Deanna, dear, come with me. I want you to meet the senior
diplomat of the Cairn delegation. Maques, this is the beautiful
daughter I've been telling you about. Deanna. 
GUEST0: Pleased to. Hello. 
TROI: Hello. Pleased to meet you. 
GUEST0: Oh, yes, that is it. Pleased to meet you, Deanna. 
LWAXANA: Good. Well, I'll just let you young people chat. 
(Lwaxana takes Hedril and moves off) 
TROI: Well, Maques, what do you think of the Enterprise? 
GUEST0: It is beautiful. Comfortable, also. 
TROI: I'm glad you think so. 
GUEST0: There is another word that describes it. But I cannot remember.

TROI: You've learned a great deal in a very short time. I'm sure it
won't be long before your words do justice to your thoughts. 
GUEST0: Your mother told me of your need. 
TROI: Need? 
GUEST0: A moment. Husband. You need a husband. I need a wife.
