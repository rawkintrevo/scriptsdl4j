(the same location as the sensor logs. There is a
shuttlepod from 45167 on the surface, named Cousteau. The away team
beam in) 
RIKER: Commander Leijten, Geordi, check out the shuttle. Data, Worf,
you've got the perimeter. 
SUSANNA: It's the shuttlepod Mendez stole from the Aries. 
(Geordi checks the pod's systems while Suzanna wanders around. She
finds some three-toed tracks and follows them) 
DATA: No life signs, Commander. 
WORF: Sir, I am certain we are being watched. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker. Found it in the shuttle. (a uniform) Where's
Commander Leijten? 
RIKER: Riker to Susanna, report. Fan out. Let's find her. 
LAFORGE: Susanna! La Forge to Leijten. 
SUSANNA [OC]: Over here. 
(in among the bushes) 
LAFORGE: Where have you been? 
SUSANNA: Mendez and Brevelle are alive. You saw the footprints? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but they're not human. 
SUSANNA: They're here. Just stand still and listen. You can feel it.
They're here. 
LAFORGE: I'm not picking up anything. Wait a minute. Where are you
going? Susanna? 
SUSANNA: Stay away. 
LAFORGE: Suz? 
(He grabs her, she struggles) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise, medical emergency. Two to Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

SUSANNA: Do I look as bad as I feel? 
LAFORGE: You look fine, now. 
SUSANNA: What happened? 
CRUSHER: Your blood chemistry is way off. You had a histamine response,
to what I don't know. I'm going to run a complete blood and tissue
analysis. 
SUSANNA: I need to get back to the surface. 
CRUSHER: Until we have some answers, I don't want you to leave the
Enterprise. 
SUSANNA: I have work to do. 
CRUSHER: Look, Commander, you may have just had an anxiety reaction
down there, but I've got to know for sure. 
LAFORGE: Might not be such a bad idea to take it easy for a while. 
SUSANNA: I'm not going to stay locked up on this ship while the
investigation's going on. 
PICARD: Your devotion to duty is admirable, Commander, but Doctor
Crusher is right. You will remain on the Enterprise until we know
whether or not this is connected to the disappearance of the others. 
SUSANNA: Captain. 
PICARD: We have completed our survey on the surface. Analysing that
data will keep us busy for a while. 
SUSANNA: Yes, sir. I understand. 
LAFORGE: Data's got a preliminary report, if you're up to it. 
SUSANNA: Sure. Let's get going. 
(Geordi and Susanna leave) 
PICARD: What about La Forge? 
CRUSHER: I gave him a complete bioscan. The results say he's in perfect
shape. 
PICARD: That's what the reports said about Mendez and Hickman before
they disappeared.
