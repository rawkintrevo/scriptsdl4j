(The boy is sitting up, staring straight ahead, not
responding) 
CRUSHER: It's Jono, right? Is that what I heard them call you? I'm
Doctor Crusher. I'm just examining you for radiation injuries. It won't
hurt. I have a son not much older than you. Perhaps you'd like to meet
him. Well, Jono, you seem to have escaped radiation damage. Pretty
lucky. 
NURSE: Doctor Crusher. 
(Hands over a PADD with his examination results) 
CRUSHER: Now how did this happen? 
(All the boys suddenly start making a keening noise and rocking back
and forth) 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
TROI: They're terrified. 
(Picard and Riker enter) 
CRUSHER: They all just started up. 
PICARD: Please may I have your attention. Please may I have your
attention! Stop that immediately! (silence) Well, that's better. Now,
what's your name, young man? 
TROI: He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through to
him. 
JONO: Captain (stands up and bows) I am Jono. Take me home to
my Captain. Take me home to Endar!

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: He managed to escape radiation trauma but
the scan shows something else. 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: Two previously fractured ribs, a broken arm, and a low grade
concussion. There might be neurological impairment. I'd like to examine
him further. Jean-Luc, the Talarians have been known to be ruthless to
their enemies. I think there's a real possibility they may have
brutalised the child. 
PICARD: Isn't it possible the injuries were caused prior to his
captivity? 
CRUSHER: Not likely. He's been with them a long time. Long enough to
assimilate their cultural traits, and calcium trace patterns indicate
the injuries took place during the past seven years. 
PICARD: But if they have abused the boy, why would he so devoutly wish
to return to them? 
CRUSHER: It's not uncommon. It was identified centuries ago as the
Stockholm syndrome. 
(There's a commotion)
