[Maranga Outpost]

(solid stone masonry and a joyous festival with
open air interactive opera including flailing bat'leths. Worf buys some
sweets from a woman) 
LAFORGE: Who's that? 
WORF: It is the tyrant Molor. He was so strong no one could stand
against him. 
SINGER: Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not? 
CRUSHER: What's he saying? 
WORF: He is asking if anyone else will have the courage to stand up to
Molor. 
SINGER: Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not? 
(Worf looks round, then goes forward to take the bat'leth) WORF:
(sings) Ki'rok, Molor, ki'rok! 
MOLOR: Ni'tokor bak'to! Ba'jak tu'mo! 
(the mock fight begins, the blades always a good foot apart) 
WORF: O'tak tu'ro! 
(Worf pretends to be beaten) 
WORF: Nok'tar be'got? Hosh'ar te'not? 
(he stares at Alexander, who finally gets the message) 
ALEXANDER: Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok! 
MOLOR: What is this? 
(of course, Alexander can't just pretend fight, and the blades clash) 
MOLOR: Jik'ta. You have wounded me. 
WORF: You fought well. 
ALEXANDER: What happens now? 
WORF: There is only one man can stand against Molor. 
SINGER: Nok'tar Kahless. 
ALEXANDER: It's Kahless! 
WORF: Kahless would rather die than live under Molor's tyranny. 
ALEXANDER: Ni'lot Kahless!
