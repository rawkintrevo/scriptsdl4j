PICARD: Computer, locate and display the text of
the novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. 
COMPUTER: Accessing. 
PICARD: If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may find
the solution within its pages. Ah. (reading)
'It was a dark and
stormy night'. It's not a promising beginning. 
TROI: It may get better. 
[Casino]

DATA: I suggest we separate and blend in with these
beings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. 
(Data heads to the table with Texas and Vanessa) 
VANESSA: I need a four. Give me a four. 
TEXAS: Oh, shoot. 
VANESSA: How much do I have left here? 
TEXAS: Honey, now you know it's bad luck to count your chips at the
table. 
VANESSA: Yeah? 
DATA: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire, where are you from? 
TEXAS: Lubbock, Texas. 
DATA: And how did you get here? 
TEXAS: To Vegas? Drove my car. I got a ninety one Caddy with only
eighty thousand miles on it. 
DATA: Where is your automobile now? 
TEXAS: Out front, I suppose. What the hell difference does it make? 
DATA: Could you take me there? 
VANESSA: Hit me. I'm losing my shirt. 
TEXAS: Son, why would I want to do that? Can't you see I'm trying to to
help this little lady? 
DATA: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. 
TEXAS: Sure does seem that way when you're losing, don't it? We're just
trying to turn this lady's wagon around, and win back some lost change.
Otherwise she's in a desperate situation and she's got nowhere to turn.
Well, almost nowhere. 
VANESSA: I stay, right? (holding thirteen) 
TEXAS: I wouldn't. 
DATA: The odds favour standing pat. 
VANESSA: What do I do? 
TEXAS: Do you want a card or what? 
VANESSA: Hit me. (a Jack) Too many. I've almost lost it all. What am I
going to do? 
TEXAS: There, there, there, there, there. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: What did you find? 
WORD: Nothing. 
CLERK: Rita just called. 
BELLBOY: She did? What did she say? 
CLERK: It was kind of hard to tell. She was crying. 
BELLBOY: Crying? Damn. Mickey D thinks he can treat people any way he
wants. Well, that's all over now. 
(Enter Mickey D through the main door, white suit with overcoat draped
across his shoulders) 
MICKEY D: You were told. 
BELLBOY: It's not for you to make the call. It's for Rita. 
MICKEY D: She sent me to tell you. 
CLERK: Okay, boys. Look, we can't afford to have any trouble in here.
Why don't you just take this outside. 
MICKEY D: Yeah, I like that. Come on, baggage man. 
[Ready room]

(Troi and Picard are listening on the open comm.
channel) 
MICKEY D [OC]: Let's you and me take it outside. 
BELLBOY [OC]: When I was a kid, I used to look up to you guys. The
suit, the fancy shoes. I really thought that made you somebody, but
you're nobody. She could make something out of her life 
(Picard mutes it) 
TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? 
PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on down
there is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. 
BELLBOY [OC]: Like Rita. She could do something with her life. She
could be somebody if she only had the chance. 
TROI: With your permission, sir. 
(Troi leaves) 
MICKEY D [OC]: She is somebody. She's my girl. 
BELLBOY [OC]: You got her on the stuff. That's the only reason she
stays with you. Because you feed her sickness. 
[Lobby]

BELLBOY: You got to let me help her. 
MICKEY D: Well why don't we just go outside and talk about it? 
CLERK: Just watch yourself. 
BELLBOY: Don't worry. 
RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. 
(Mickey D shoots the bellboy in the back as he walks to the door. The
customers scream) 
MICKEY D: You should have listened to me, kid. No woman's worth dying
for. Killing for, not dying for. 
(Mickey D leaves) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: Yes, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: A bizarre incident just took place. 
PICARD: The shoot-out between the bellboy and Mickey D. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: Yes, and Mickey D just walked out the door.
How did he do that? 
[Ready room]

PICARD: It's on page 244. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: In the novel. Right. How does it end?
