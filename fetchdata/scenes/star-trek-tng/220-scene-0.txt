(at Red Alert) 
WORF: Forward tubes armed and ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Fire. 
WORF: A direct hit, sir. 
DATA: The asteroid has shattered. However, the core is still intact and
still on a collision course with Tessen Three. 
RIKER: Is it big enough to cause a threat? 
DATA: Yes, sir. It is of sufficient size and density to cause
planetwide damage. 
PICARD: Time to impact. 
DATA: It will reach the upper atmosphere in forty four seconds and
impact on the planet eleven seconds later. 
RIKER: Ready torpedoes. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Sir, the core is composed of nitrium and chrondite. It is
unlikely another photon torpedo will be of any effect. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a tractor beam. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Thirty seconds to impact. 
WORF: Captain, I am unable to get a positive lock with the tractor
beam. There is magnetic field interference emanating from the core
materials. 
PICARD: Activate a deflector dish. If we project a particle beam, we
may be able to produce a disruptive nuclear effect within the core. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Impact in seventeen seconds. 
WORF: Particle beam activated. The target has been destroyed, Captain. 
DATA: The remaining debris is of no threat to the planet, sir. 
PICARD: Well done, everyone . Ensign, put us back on course for the
Moselina system. Warp four as soon as we're clear of the debris field. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
(and shiny bits of debris settle on the ship's hull as it sails through
the field)
