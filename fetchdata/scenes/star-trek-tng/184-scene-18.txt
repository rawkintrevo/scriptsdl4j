LAFORGE: Everything down here seems normal enough,
sir, but I suggest we take it a bit slower this time.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees to
starboard. 
ALLENBY: New course laid in at ninety degrees to starboard. 
PICARD: One quarter impulse, engage. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. Nothing, Captain. Speed and course are unaffected. 
PICARD: One half impulse. 
ALLENBY: No change. 
PICARD: Full impulse. Rotate heading in five degree increments. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. 
(the ship shakes) 
RIKER: La Forge? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: There's nothing wrong down here. The
engines are fine.

[Bridge]

DATA: Integrity field stress exceeding eighty two
million kilodynes. Recommend immediate shutdown, sir. 
PICARD: Make it so, Ensign. 
ALLENBY: All engines down. We're still being pulled. Same heading, same
speed.

[Troi's office]

CRUSHER: I got here as quickly as I could. I've got
a Sickbay filled with headaches. How are you? 
TROI: Well, when I first called you I was feeling intense pain. Now
it's gone, but I'm feeling a bit foggy. 
CRUSHER: I'd like to take you to Sickbay and run an inner nuncial
series. Can you walk? 
RIKER [OC]: All senior staff report to the Observation Lounge. 
CRUSHER: Are you up to that? 
TROI: I think so. 
(then she gets a look of horror on her face) 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
TROI: Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: Could it be some sort of tractor beam? 
DATA: No other ship is indicated. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, what is your analysis? 
WORF: Tactical sensor readings are indeterminant. 
LAFORGE: They don't even give us enough for an educated guess. 
RIKER: And yet all sensors are operating properly. 
PICARD: Can there be an intelligence at work here? Counsellor, do you
sense a lifeform out there? 
TROI: No, I don't think so. No. There's nothing. Nothing. I sense
nothing. 
PICARD: It's alright, Counsellor. Perhaps there's nothing out there to
sense. 
DATA: Indeed, there are many races that are not empathically
detectable. The Breen, the Ferengi, the 
TROI: No, you don't understand. I don't sense anything. Not out there,
not in here. All of you, you're all blank to me. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: No indication of a concussion or a blow to
the head. Just a pattern of unresponsive neural cells throughout the
cerebellum and cerebral cortex. 
TROI: Unresponsive? 
CRUSHER: There's brain damage. How serious, I can't tell yet. 
TROI: But I feel perfectly fine otherwise. 
RIKER: Can you treat it? 
CRUSHER: I'm not sure. I have to review the database on Betazoid
neurophysiology. 
TROI: The Betazoid brain has a remarkable ability to heal itself. This
condition could just reverse itself time. 
CRUSHER: It might. But you are half human. That changes the map a
little. I don't want to offer you any false hopes. 
TROI: It's just hope, Beverly. Not false hope. 
RIKER: What would cause something like this? Because it started at the
same time we encountered the anomaly. 
CRUSHER: There may be a connection. I don't know. If you were anyone
else, you know the first thing I'd do? I'd send you to Counsellor Troi.

TROI: Well, then I have an advantage, don't I? I see her quite often. 
CRUSHER: Deanna, it's no different than one of us suddenly going blind.

TROI: You don't have to tell me, Beverly. I understand the psychology. 
CRUSHER: You may understand it but you've never had to live with it. 
TROI: I may be perfectly fine by tomorrow. 
CRUSHER: And you may not. Now, I'll do my homework. I'll see what I can
do to regenerate those cells. In the meantime, I want you to talk to
someone. There are several people on board who have degrees in
psychology, who are qualified therapists. 
TROI: Okay, fine, if I need to. Right now, I just want to go back to
work. 
RIKER: Deanna. 
TROI: If there are no medical objections? 
CRUSHER: No medical objections. 
TROI: Thank you, Beverly. Will.
