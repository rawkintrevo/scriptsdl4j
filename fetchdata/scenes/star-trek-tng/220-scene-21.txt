JUGGLER TROI CAMPIO WORF ALEXANDER LWAXANA ERKO DATA LAFORGE

[Lwaxana's quarters]

CAMPIO: I don't wish to be authoritative, my dear,
but Master Erko says that now is our proper time for discussion of
certain details. 
LWAXANA: Well, I certainly don't wish to be considered anti-Erko, dear,
but I did promise Alexander one more holodeck trip. Come along, my
little love. 
CAMPIO: Surely there'll be other occasions for you to spend time with
the boy. 
LWAXANA: My goodness, Campio. You and I are going to have the rest of
our lives. I'll tell you what. I'll be back here with you in one hour
exactly, all right? 
ERKO: Minister, the woman should not be addressing you in the familiar.

(Troi and Worf enter) 
TROI: Mother, we have to talk. 
LWAXANA: Yes, we certainly do, dear, but not just now. Well, how, er
how do I address him? 
TROI: Mother, we've come for Alexander. Please, forgive the intrusion. 
ERKO: Preferably he should be called by his ministerial title. 
LWAXANA: Ah. I'll remember. Oh, Mister Homn. You make everybody
comfortable until we get back. Especially the Minister, here. Now, I'll
be back. One hour, darling. I'll see you then. 
WORF: Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's dinner hour. 
LWAXANA: How thoughtless of me. I guess we'll just have to have a
little picnic before our mud bath. 
CAMPIO: We have business to deal with here. Leaving is simply not
acceptable. 
LWAXANA: Oh, well can't we just pretend it's acceptable? We'll be back.

CAMPIO: You are missing the point. 
WORF: Alexander, you will return to our quarters and have dinner. 
ALEXANDER: But we're going to go to the holodeck. 
TROI: Mother, you're undermining every effort we're trying to make
here. 
LWAXANA: Don't be absurd. You poor dear, don't they ever let you change
those colourless outfits? 
ERKO: It is essential that we begin a discussion of the wedding
procedures now. 
LWAXANA: Oh, Minister, darling, perhaps you and the Jerko here can come
with us. 
CAMPIO: Lwaxana, this exceeds all boundaries. 
LWAXANA: Oh. Well, half hour, then. No longer, I promise. Mister Homn,
your duties. 
CAMPIO: Counsellor Troi, have you no influence? 
TROI: Ha! 
ALEXANDER: Ha! 
CAMPIO: Lwaxana, if you will remain, I may allow the boy to stay 
ERKO: Definitely not! 
WORF: Definitely not. My son is to return to quarters. 
ERKO: Nor may a servant be present during a prenuptial consultation. 
(Lwaxana has sneaked out with Alexander) 
TROI: Well, sir, I'm afraid even the bride won't be present for this
one.

[Engineering]

DATA: The dilithium chamber shows no anomalous
readings. 
LAFORGE: So far, these transfer conduits are clean, too. Hold on, I'm
getting something here. There's a severe energy fluctuation in this
access panel. 
(La Forge removes the cover and the silver stuff floats up the wall to
the ceiling, then gloop starts to dribble down)

[Holodeck - Shiralea]

(the Juggler is unhappy) 
ALEXANDER: What happened? 
JUGGLER: I was just juggling and I happened to catch one in my mouth.
It tasted good, so I ate it. Before I knew it, I'd eaten up every one
of my worlds. It never occurred to me that once they were gone, I'd
have nothing left to juggle. If you ever have a world, plan ahead.
Don't eat it. 
LWAXANA: Well, now. Almost time to get back. 
ALEXANDER: Are you sad? 
LWAXANA: Of course not. I'm about to be a bride. 
ALEXANDER: You know that man you're going to marry? He would never come
and take a mud bath, would he. 
LWAXANA: Oh, he might. Probably not. 
ALEXANDER: You know, maybe this would be a good time to get one of
those little people that live inside of you to come out and tell you
what to do, or help you, or something. 
LWAXANA: Alexander, what are you talking about? 
ALEXANDER: I'm sorry. 
LWAXANA: No. No, don't you dare be sorry. 
(she notices the grid appearing through the illusion) 
ALEXANDER: What's wrong? 
LWAXANA: Come along, Alexander. Let's not leave everyone waiting for
us.
