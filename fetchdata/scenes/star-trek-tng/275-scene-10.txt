DATA: This is a synaptic map of the human
neo-cortex. This is a cross section of my positronic net. And this is a
schematic of the connection nodes linking the ship's systems. I believe
some sort of neural matrix is forming on the ship. It is still
relatively primitive, but it is an intelligence nonetheless. 
TROI: How could that happen? 
DATA: I believe it is an emergent property. 
PICARD: Explain. 
DATA: Complex systems can sometimes behave in ways that are entirely
unpredictable. The human brain, for example, might be described in
terms of cellular functions and neurochemical interactions. But that
description does not explain human consciousness, a capacity that far
exceeds simple neural functions. Consciousness is an emergent property.

LAFORGE: In other words, something that's more than just the sum of its
parts. 
DATA: Exactly. 
CRUSHER: How does that explain what's happening to the Enterprise? 
DATA: The Enterprise contains a vast database of information which is
managed by a sophisticated computer. This complex system gives the ship
many of the characteristics of a biological organism. 
RIKER: That's true. It sees with its sensors, it talks with its
communications systems. 
CRUSHER: In a sense, it almost reproduces with the replicators. 
PICARD: And you think that the ship has somehow gone beyond those
functions and is developing a new capacity? 
DATA: Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining intelligence is emerging. 
WORF: If that is so, what does the ship want? Where is it taking us? 
DATA: I believe the key to understanding the ship's behaviour lies in
the holodeck. All of the connection nodes intersect at that location.
It is clearly some kind of processing centre. 
PICARD: Processing centre? 
DATA: Yes, sir. A focal point where all the ideas and instincts of this
emerging intelligence are first expressed in some form. 
TROI: Almost like an imagination. Captain, I'd like to go to the
holodeck. I could interact with the characters and maybe find some
clues to help us understand what's happening. 
PICARD: Very well. Mister Data, Mister Worf, I want you to go along.
See if you can to re-establish control of the ship without damaging the
nodes. If the ship is truly an emerging intelligence, then we have a
responsibility to treat it with the same respect as any other being.
