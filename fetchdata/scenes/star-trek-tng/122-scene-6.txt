LYNCH: Working on it, Captain. Three minutes. 
[Bridge]

LYNCH [OC]: But there are no guarantees. 
PRIETO [OC]: Captain, we're out of control. We're caught in the
planet's gravity. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We've lost all contact
with shuttlecraft thirteen, and can only assume they've crash-landed on
Vagra Two.
Meanwhile, main Engineering is trying to return us to warp power.

LYNCH: Forget the final check. Initiate start-up
sequence. 
COMPUTER: Beginning check list. 
LYNCH: Override. We are going directly to start-up. 
COMPUTER: That procedure is not recommended. 
LYNCH: Understood. Now. Prime matter-antimatter injectors. Set ratio at
twenty-five to one 
COMPUTER: Ratio set. 
LYNCH: Power engine core. Inject reactants.

LYNCH [OC]: Leland T. Lynch here, Captain. We now
have minimum warp drive. 
LAFORGE: Course plotted and set for Vagra Two. 
PICARD: Warp eight. 
LYNCH [OC]: I said minimum warp drive, Captain. 
PICARD: You heard the order, Mister Lynch. Make it so. 
LYNCH [OC]: Yes, sir. 
(later) 
LAFORGE: Approaching Vagra Two, Captain. 
DATA: Strange, sir. There's no emergency signal from the shuttle as
yet. 
PICARD: What is this place, Mister Data? 
DATA: There is little information in the library computer other than
the fact of its existence. Our sensor show no signs of life forms,
virtually no vegetation. 
RIKER: Atmosphere? 
DATA: Minimum for our needs, sir. 
PICARD: Standard orbit. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Standard orbit. 
WORF: I've located the shuttle. 
PICARD: Life signs? 
WORF: Not yet, sir. Still probing. It appears to be buried under a lot
of debris. I may have something, sir. Faint life signs. Very faint. 
RIKER: How many? 
WORF: There's no way of telling from here. 
PICARD: Data, can we beam up the injured? 
DATA: No, sir. Our sensors are not fully penetrating whatever the
debris is. 
PICARD: That's very unusual. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain. 
PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. 
RIKER: Right away. Data, Yar. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher, have you been monitoring all this? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Yes. I'll meet the away team in transporter room four.
