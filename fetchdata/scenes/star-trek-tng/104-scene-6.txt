[Bridge]

PICARD: Wesley? 
WESLEY: I haven't stepped one foot on your Bridge, Captain. 
RIKER: It's all right, sir, I'll see that he leaves immediately. 
PICARD: No. 
RIKER: No? 
PICARD: Why don't you sit at Ops next to Lieutenant La Forge. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
LAFORGE: Sir? 
PICARD: Is the whole ship deaf?! Sit down over there, young man.
Temporarily. 
TROI: Captain, we have more information from the briefing studies on
Ligon. 
PICARD: Excuse me. Doctor Crusher, some of this may interest you. Lets
hear the analysis. 
DATA: It is a highly structured society in which people live by strict
codes of honour. For example, what Lutan did is similar to what certain
American Indians once did called counting coup. That's from an obscure
language called French. Counting coup 
PICARD: Mister Data, the French language for centuries on Earth
represented civilisation. 
DATA: Indeed? But surely, sir 
RIKER: I suggest you drop it, Mister Data. 
DATA: Yes, sir. Counting coup could be as simple as touching an enemy
with a stick in battle, or taking something from him and escaping. It
was considered extremely heroic. 
RIKER: And under these circumstances Lutan considers himself heroic,
risking literally everything in the face of our superior power. 
TROI: And it fits Lutan's personality profile as well. He has an
abnormally high need for achievement. Self image to him is a function
of what he thinks he's achieved. Those who set their standards too high
can kill to meet them. 
CRUSHER: Why Tasha? 
TROI: As a Starfleet Security Officer, she may have represented his
riskiest prize. 
DATA: Transmission from the planet surface, sir, Main viewer on. 
PICARD: Well, Lutan, what do you want? 
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: You will display your image, please. 
PICARD: What is required is an image of Lieutenant Yar, well and 
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: Are you making demands, Captain? 
TROI: Sir. According to the Ligon Code of Honour, Lutan has done what
he set out to do, achieve recognition for being daring and bold. 
RIKER: We've studied this in some depth now, sir. The proper thing for
you to do now is to ask to get Tasha back. 
PICARD: Ask for her? 
DATA: Politely, Captain. 
PICARD: And now, Lutan, you have boldly taken Lieutenant Yar from us,
and we ask that you now please return her. 
LUTAN [on viewscreen]: Then come visit us, Captain, and we will return
her to you. 
(a little later) 
TROI: Commander. 
RIKER: Commander? That's quite formal. 
TROI: So is this request, sir. We believe it would be preferable if the
Captain led this away party. 
DATA: Agreed, sir. Their customs concerning guests make it much
preferable. 
RIKER: And I'm very much against that idea. Lutan is clearly a liar,
and devious. Counsellor Troi has admitted she believes he's capable of
killing. It is my duty to keep the Captain from danger, sir. 
DATA: Except that Ligonian custom makes it clear that a visiting leader
becomes an honoured guest. Not us, not second in command, him. 
TROI: And the custom requires that Lutan should die rather than violate
that. 
RIKER: Yes, it seems reasonable put that way. But I warn you, if you
get hurt, I'll put you on report, Captain.
