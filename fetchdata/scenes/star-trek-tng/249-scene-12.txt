PICARD TORIN GOWRON KOROTH KAHLESS

[Corridor]

GOWRON: What kind of medical analysis have you
made? Do you have any theories about his true origin? 
PICARD: We haven't done any analysis. 
GOWRON: What kind of fools do you have working for you, Picard? The
imposter's been aboard for nearly a day. 
PICARD: If you wanted to run tests on Kahless, you should have sent a
Klingon ship for him. 
GOWRON: And have him begin spreading his poisonous lies through a ship
of loyal Klingons? Never. 
PICARD: If he really is an imposter then you have nothing to worry
about. 
GOWRON: Kahless has been dead for a thousand years, but the idea of
Kahless is still alive. Have you ever fought an idea, Picard? It has no
weapon to destroy, no body to kill. The idea of Kahless' return must be
stopped here, now, or it will travel through the Empire like a wave and
leave nothing but destruction behind.

[Kahless' quarters]

PICARD: So Gowron has come on board in order to
test your claim. 
KOROTH: Gowron knows that his days are nearly over. Now he comes
crawling aboard with some kind of test. 
TORIN: We do not have to prove anything to Gowron. 
KAHLESS: What is this test? 
PICARD: He has brought a knife with him, a knife is was supposed to be
stained with the blood of Kahless. 
TORIN: Gowron has brought the Knife of Kirom? No one is permitted to
remove it from the sacred vault. 
KOROTH: Gowron does not care about what is sacred. 
PICARD: He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood and
on you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if you
agree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available to
ensure that it is conducted impartially. 
KAHLESS: (looking at Worf) Perhaps it is time to settle the doubts of
those who still do not believe. I will allow this test.
