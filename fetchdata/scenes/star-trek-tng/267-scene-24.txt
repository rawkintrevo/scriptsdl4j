TROI BEN LAFORGE WORF SITO RIKER TAURIK LAVELLE OGAWA TROI + CRUSHER
fours job late matter shouldn disappoint post come bet

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

BEN: The bet is fifty. 
TAURIK: It would be illogical for the Captain to deny you a promotion
for something you did as a cadet. 
SITO: He said it shows I don't have character. 
OGAWA: What did you say? 
SITO: What could I say? Maybe he's right. 
LAVELLE: Hey, you're a damn fine officer and you deserve that post as
much as anyone. One thing's for sure, I won't be getting it. Not if
it's up to Riker.

[Riker's quarters]

WORF: It is your decision, sir, but I am certain if
you give Ensign Sito a chance to prove herself, she will not disappoint
you. 
RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm not
convinced about Lavelle. 
TROI: Really? Why? 
RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiate
himself to me. 
TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job? 
LAFORGE: Fifty. 
RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more. 
TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lot
alike. 
RIKER: What? We're not at all alike. 
LAFORGE: You're bluffing.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

LAVELLE: You think so? 
BEN: Yes, and I'm not going to let you get away with it. 
OGAWA: You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't try so hard with Riker. It
doesn't matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you. 
SITO: He must, otherwise he would not be considering you for the Ops
position. 
LAVELLE: You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates
me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse. 
BEN: You in or not? 
TAURIK: At this juncture, the odds of my winning this hand are less
than thirty nine to one. I fold.

[Riker's quarters]

LAFORGE: The Commander's flush is still working. No
help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. And Jacks and fours for the
Counsellor. Ah, three sixes. 
WORF: Fold. 
RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking. Give me a second, here. 
TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the
officer's game at the Potemkin? 
RIKER: I happen to like poker. 
TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to
ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were
young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. 
RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. 
WORF: I do not believe he is bluffing. 
LAFORGE: I do. There you go. What've you got? 
WORF: Flush. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe this. 
RIKER: I am your worst nightmare.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(Lavelle has sevens and sixes, and a queen) 
BEN: I knew it. 
LAVELLE: How could you tell I was bluffing? 
BEN: You don't really expect me to answer that, do you? 
SITO: Look, it's getting late. Maybe we should all get some sleep. 
BEN: One more hand. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit just
because I'm unbeatable? 
LAFORGE: Nah, there's something I need to do down in Engineering. I'll
get you next time. 
RIKER: I'll be there. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight, everybody. 
TROI + CRUSHER: Goodnight.
