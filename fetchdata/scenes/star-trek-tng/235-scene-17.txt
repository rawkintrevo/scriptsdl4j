[Transporter room]

(three exocomps sit on the pads) 
FARALLON: Commander Riker, we're ready.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Mister Worf, target two hundred metres below
the apex of the particle stream. Feed the coordinates to transporter
room two. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Coordinates received. 
RIKER: Mister Kelso.

[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: Energize. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Mister Kelso? 
[Transporter room]

GUEST1: I'm sorry, sir. The transporter system just
went dead. There's some kind of malfunction. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Run a diagnostic immediately. Try bypassing
the 
DATA: Commander, that will not be necessary. The transporter is not
malfunctioning. I have locked out the controls.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: I gave you a direct order, Mister Data. You
release that transporter lockout now. 
DATA: I cannot do that, sir. 
RIKER: If you don't do it, I will relieve you of duty. 
DATA: That is your prerogative, sir. Under Starfleet regulations,
direct insubordination is a court martial offence. But I will not
release the transporter. 
RIKER: Data, those are two of your friends out there. They have saved
your life more times than I can remember. I can't believe you'd be
willing to sacrifice them like this. 
DATA: Commander, please do not think this is an arbitrary decision. I
have considered the ramifications of my actions carefully, and I do not
believe it is justifiable to sacrifice one life form for another. 
RIKER: You don't know that the exocomps are life forms. 
DATA: It is true I am acting on my personal beliefs, but I do not see
how I can do otherwise. 
RIKER: You're risking a lot on the basis of a belief. 
DATA: I have observed that humans often base their judgments on what is
referred to as instinct or intuition. Because I am a machine, I lack
that particular ability. However it may be possible that I have insight
into other machines that humans lack. 
RIKER: If there were a way to save the Captain and Geordi without
destroying the exocomps, I would jump on it, but we have run out of
time and this is the only solution I've got. 
DATA: Then let me offer an alternative. Transport me to the station, I
will attempt a complete manual shut down of the particle stream. 
RIKER: The radiation levels are too high, even for you. Your positronic
net would ionise in no time. I can't let you sacrifice yourself. 
DATA: Commander, if I give my life to save my fellow officers, that is
my choice. The exocomps no longer have a choice. 
RIKER: Then what if we re-connect their command pathways and we give
them a choice? You've assumed the exocomps would shut down before
accepting this mission. What if we ask them if they are willing to
proceed. 
DATA: That sounds reasonable, sir. If they choose to go, I would be
willing to release the transporter lock out. 
RIKER: Fair enough.
