(Jono is writhing on a bed as people try to hold
him down. He escapes from them and runs around) 
TROI: Jono, what is it? Jono! I just suggested he take off his gloves.
Suddenly he lost control. 
CRUSHER: Security, we need some assistance down here in Sickbay. 
PICARD: Jono! 
JONO: She won't leave me alone! She keeps trying to dissect me! 
PICARD: She was trying to help you.! 
JONO: I don't want her help! I should be back with my brothers! Send us
back to Captain Endar! 
PICARD: Jono, I want you to stop this immediately! 
JONO: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Good. That's better. Now, if we're to accomplish anything

[Guest quarters]

JONO: Why are you here, Klingon, with them? Did
they capture you too? 
WORF: They are not my captors. They are my comrades. 
JONO: Why do you take orders from a female? 
WORF: Doctor Crusher. She is my superior officer. 
JONO: Among my people, a female can never outrank a man. 
WORF: You are human, and among humans, females can achieve anything the
males can. 
JONO: I am no more human than you are. I am Talarian. 
WORF: You are confused. 
(Jono starts keening again) 
WORF: Stop that! 
JONO: I will make the B'Nar, the mourning, until I am back with my
brothers!
