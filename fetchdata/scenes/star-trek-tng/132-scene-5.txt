GUEST1: Much of what we do is similar. 
TROI: Yes, I suppose in a way it is. 
GUEST1: We have both learned how to allow people to examine feelings
hidden deep within their psyche. In fact, with you here now is
provoking an emotional revelation. 
TROI: You mean some emotion buried in your psyche? 
GUEST1: Well, not that deep. 
TROI: Exactly what are you feeling? 
GUEST1: Can't you tell? 
TROI: Some of it. 
GUEST1: Well I feel that soon, perhaps after the briefing by your
Captain, that you will be hungry, and that perhaps we could dine
together and compare experiences. 
TROI: I'd like that. 
GUEST1: As will I. 
TROI: Will he be with us? 
GUEST1: Well, until we find our own method of communication. 
TROI: I look forward to that time. 
GUEST1: As do I.

(Picard enters) 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Data. Begin the briefing. 
DATA: The factions on Solais Five are historical enemies. So many have
died that both societies are on the verge of extinction. 
GUEST0: Enough. Thank you, Captain, there is no need to continue. The
specific issues of the conflict have no relevance. 
RIKER: So none of the background which we have provided would be
helpful in understanding why they continue to fight? 
GUEST0: The portfolio will indicate that the conflict is over a piece
of land, or wealth, or some other tangible asset. But we both know that
is not the case. 
RIKER: They've been at war for so long, it has become personal. 
GUEST0: Exactly. The basis for peace must also be personal. This is an
historic confrontation, correct? 
DATA: The factions have been at war for fifteen centuries. 
GUEST0: What's changed? 
DATA: I do not know what you mean. 
GUEST0: They have been killing each other for a long time, now they
want to talk peace. So something about this situation has recently
changed. What's the new piece to the puzzle? 
PICARD: Data? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. 
RIKER: Perhaps they have run out of people to kill. In any case,
whatever the reason, peace is now preferred,
which should make your job easier. 
GUEST0: Well, if not easier, at least possible, for now they are
motivated. But it doesn't matter. I'll find something. I always have. 
PICARD: Always? 
GUEST0: To date, I have never failed. Now, unless there is something
else? 
PICARD: No. This is for your benefit. 
WOMAN: Then, thank you for your time and effort. 
GUEST1: I believe I have to get ready for a dinner appointment. 
WOMAN: (as the men are already heading out the door) If you will excuse
me. 
PICARD: Yes, of course. The meeting is adjourned. 
RIKER: Our mediator is very self assured. We'll know soon enough if he
can deliver.
