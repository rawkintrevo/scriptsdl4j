WESLEY RIKER TROI WORF PICARD

[Bridge]

RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Standard orbit. 
PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Transporter room five. I'm still a little
uncomfortable with your leading this away team. 
PICARD: This is not an away team, Commander. I consider this a
ceremonial function. For me not to go could be construed as lack of
interest. 
RIKER: You will be careful, sir 
PICARD: Oh, cluck, cluck, Number One. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. Actually
I'm looking forward to meeting this mediator. 
RIKER: We came a long way to get him. 
PICARD: They wanted the best. That, according to all reports, is Riva.

[Corridor]

PICARD: If he can put an end to all the years of
blood-letting on those planets, I think we should do everything in our
power to assist him. 
RIKER: Our job is not to police the galaxy. 
PICARD: Isn't that my speech, Number One? No, of course you're right.
We must not get involved. 
[Transporter room]

(O'Brien is transporter chief today) 
WORF: Coordinates have been input, sir. 
TROI: Have your sensors indicated any problem down there,
Lieutenant?
WORF: None. 
TROI: But you're feeling a certain confusion about this mission. 
WORF: No. 
TROI: Yes. I've never known you to have such strong emotions, except
when you're expecting to do battle. 
WORF: I am not expecting battle. 
RIKER: Then what is bothering you? 
WORF: Riva. 
PICARD: Ah. Riva negotiated several treaties between the Klingons and
the Federation.
WORF: Before him, there was no Klingon word for peacemaker. 
RIKER: Then I can understand why you're feeling uneasy. 
PICARD: Now look, this is a simple ceremonial greeting, nothing more.
All right? 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Picard, Troi and Worf get on the transporter pads) 
PICARD: Energise.
