ends talking aye screen knocking calling thought equipment commander

[Bridge]

(at the Science station) 
RIKER: Any luck? 
DATA: Starfleet records contain no mention of the Duras sisters after
their departure from Deep Space Nine. 
K'MTAR: Did I not tell you as much? 
RIKER: Have you been able to contact Deep Space Nine? 
WORF: I am being patched through right now, sir. 
RIKER: On screen. Quark. I see you remember me. 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: How could I forget the only man ever to win
triple down dabo at one of my tables? 
RIKER: And how could I forget that you didn't have enough latinum to
cover my winnings? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: I thought I explained that my brother had
misplaced the key to the safe. Besides, those vouchers I gave you are
every bit as good as latinum. 
RIKER: Not exactly. You can spend latinum just about anywhere. Those
vouchers are only good at your bar. 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: Is that what this is about? You're on your way
and you're calling to reserve a holosuite programme? 
RIKER: Actually, I was hoping you could help me with something else. 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: What would that be? 
RIKER: I'm looking for some Klingon friends of mine. The Duras sisters,
Lursa and B'Etor? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: Yes, Lursa and B'Etor. Big talk, small tips. 
RIKER: Do you know where I can find them? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: Well, I did hear a rumour, actually. 
RIKER: What kind of rumour? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: Oh, I don't know. I'm sure it was told to me in
confidence. 
RIKER: And how much would your confidence cost? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: How many vouchers do you have, again? 
RIKER: I have enough for twelve bars of latinum. I'd be glad to return
them. 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: I believe the rumour was that the sisters were
trying to buy some second hand mining equipment. 
RIKER: What for? 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: They learned of a magnesite deposit on the Kalla
system. It belongs to the Pakleds, but those fools don't even know it's
there. Your, er, friends tried to get at it. 
RIKER: All right. I'll send those vouchers to you. 
QUARK [on viewscreen]: Don't bother. I voided them while we've been
talking. 
RIKER: So long, Quark. 
(transmission ends) 
RIKER: How long would it take us to get to the Kalla system? 
WORF: Approximately sixteen hours, sir. 
K'MTAR: Could not he have been lying? 
RIKER: Why would he? I'd just be knocking on his door again in a few
days, and I wouldn't be in as good a mood. 
K'MTAR: Congratulations, Commander. I did not think it would be
possible to find the sisters. 
RIKER: Take us out of orbit. 
HELM: Aye, sir.
