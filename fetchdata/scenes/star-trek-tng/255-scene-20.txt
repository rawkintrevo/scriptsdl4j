PICARD RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE DRLAFORGE

[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: Data, disconnect! What happened? Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. My hands. 
CRUSHER: They're burned. 
[Sickbay]

(Geordi's hands are in the healing box) 
PICARD: How did this happen? 
CRUSHER: There was some kind of energy discharge in the interface suit.

PICARD: But shouldn't the safety overrides have prevented that? 
CRUSHER: Yes, but I have a theory why they didn't. The tolerance levels
of the interface were set extremely high. I think Geordi's neural
response to the input was so strong that it created a feedback loop. 
LAFORGE: The sensors that were transmitting the sensation of heat to my
hands must've overloaded. 
PICARD: The crew of the Raman are dead. I would like to retrieve them
and their vessel, but not if it means putting Geordi's safety at risk. 
LAFORGE: If we turn down the sensory input on the probe, I should be
fine. Seven people lost their lives down there, Captain. We should at
least retrieve the information they were collecting. 
PICARD: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: If we operate the interface at lower input levels, I'd say the
risk is acceptable. 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PICARD: We will proceed with the probe. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: We'll have to take it into the Raman's
auxiliary control room. Their Bridge is too badly damaged. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD: How long before you have it in position? 
RIKER [OC]: A couple of hours. We have to cut through the bulkhead. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. 
CRUSHER: Well, it looks like you'll have time to recuperate. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. There's something I've got to do anyway.

[La Forge's quarters]

(his Dad's on the monitor - played by Ben Vareen) 
LAFORGE: How are you, Dad? 
DR LA FORGE: As well as expected, under the circumstances. Are you
okay? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
DR LA FORGE: I spoke with your sister this morning. She said she'll be
in touch with you in a few days. Right now, she's pretty upset. The
service for the Hera will probably be on Vulcan. Most of the crew was
from there. But your sister and I want to have a private ceremony. 
LAFORGE: Dad. Don't you think everybody's jumping the gun here? Last I
heard there were still two starships out there looking for them.
They've found no debris, no residual warp distortion. 
DR LA FORGE: And no ship. 
LAFORGE: Not yet, but that doesn't mean they won't. 
DR LA FORGE: Starfleet is considering the Hera lost. The search isn't
much more than a formality at this point. Geordi, your mother's gone. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well you can think that if you want. But until I see
some hard evidence, I'm not going to give up hope. 
DR LA FORGE: All right, Geordi. Call me if you need anything.
