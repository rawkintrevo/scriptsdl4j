PICARD: Well, there's nothing unusual about that. 
[Bridge]

DATA: No, sir. However, the star's single planet
falls within the M-class range. It is capable of supporting life. 
[Hill's office]

PICARD: That is unusual. 
DATA [OC]: Highly, sir. 
PICARD: Well, thank you, Mister Data. Procedures require that we
investigate. Recall the bridge crew and set in a course. 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Gloria, but there is a twenty-fourth century mystery
I have to investigate. You are very welcome to carry on, if you like. 
GUINAN: No, I've had enough fun for today.

MCKNIGHT: (the blonde lady at helm) Entering the
T-tauri system, now, Captain. 
DATA: Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path.
Source unknown. 
WORF: Still picking up energy distortions, but fading. It seems to be
gone. 
PICARD: A wormhole? 
DATA: Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have been
mapped near thirty nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred years
alone, sir. 
RIKER: Captain, I suggest we move to a safer location. It could
reappear at any moment. 
PICARD: Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course 
DATA: Captain! 
(Big swirly thing on viewscreen. When Data turns around everyone else
is out cold. They wake up after the opening titles) 
DATA: Captain? 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: Careful, Captain. The stun effect from the wormhole was
relatively severe. 
PICARD: Apparently so. How long were we unconscious? 
DATA: Approximately thirty seconds. I have scanned the entire ship and
detected no life-threatening injuries among the crew. 
PICARD: You were not affected? 
DATA: No, sir. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This is
the third unstable wormhole I have passed through during my time with
Starfleet. The first was aboard the USS Trieste 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Well, where the hell are we? 
RIKER: Point five four parsecs from our original position. Almost a
day's travel in just thirty seconds? 
DATA: Sir, I should re-align the ship's clock with Starbase four ten's
subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
DATA: Yes, Captain. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, this is Crusher in Sickbay. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I'm getting scattered reports

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Of minor injuries. What's happened? 
PICARD [OC]: The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole.
