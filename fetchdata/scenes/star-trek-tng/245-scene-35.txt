[Planet surface]

(the people look a mess, dirty and sweaty) 
NELLA: Daren to perimeter teams. The storm's interference is going to
make our job harder than we thought. We may lose
communication, so it's up to each of you to keep your units
operational. A lot of people are depending on us. Daren out. 
(she peeks up over the ridge) 
NELLA: Oh, my god.

[Bridge]

WORF: The storm has reached the perimeter.

[Sickbay]

RIKER: I got out with the last of the colonists. If
it hadn't been for the perimeter teams, none of us would have made it.
We were able to clear out four of the teams, and the interference
prevented us from getting two more. I don't know how they could have
survived. 
PICARD: Which teams are missing? 
RIKER: Three and six. 
RIKER: The last I knew, Commander Daren was on team six.

[Picard's quarters]

(the flute lies in it's box, forlorn) 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Captain. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. 
WORF [OC]: We have found survivors, sir. They are beaming up now. 
PICARD: I'm on my way.

[Transporter room]

(Picard enters as one group arrives, then Nella is
beamed up supporting Deng) 
NELLA: (to Deng) That's it. 
CREWMAN: Here, let me help up. 
NELLA: Thank you. 
(and she leaves without a word to Picard)

Captain's log, stardate 46697.2. Although we
succeeded in rescuing all six hundred forty three Bersallin colonists
we lost eight crewmembers. Let the record show that they gave their
lives in the performance of their duty.
