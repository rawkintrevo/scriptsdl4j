Q PICARD DATA AMANDA

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? 
DATA: I have further information regarding the tornado that killed
Amanda Rogers' parents. 
PICARD: What is it? 
DATA: It was unusually compact, yet extremely powerful. Its recorded
wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size. 
PICARD: Download the files to my Ready room. I'll study them there. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 

[Amanda's quarters]

Q: Have you been practicing your teleportation? 
AMANDA: Yes. But it's kind of hard. I keep ending up somewhere I don't
want to be. 
Q: Well, it won't do to be sloppy. You should hone your abilities. I
have a wonderful idea. Why don't we play a little game?
I'll hide somewhere on the ship and you find me. 
AMANDA: But how do I know how? 
(Q vanishes) 
Q [OC]: Don't worry, Amanda. You can do it. 
[Shuttlebay two]

(Amanda reveals that Q has disguised himself as a
container) 
Q: Not bad. Not bad at all.

[Engineering]

DATA: If we can use phase buffers we may be able to
devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system while
it is in operation. 
(Amanda appears. Data and Geordi stare at her. She's about to leave
when Q sticks his head out of the warp core) 
Q: You're still thinking like a human.
