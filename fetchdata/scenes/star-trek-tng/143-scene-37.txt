GREBNEDLOG: You are smart. 
LAFORGE: Not smart enough. I'm still here. 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: I thought you wanted me to help you go. Why don't we work on
that guidance system, okay? 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong, or die.

SURGEON: It's not working. Something's wrong. The
metabolation occlusions aren't holding. Damn it! I can't stop the
heterocyclic declination. Fuse. 
(laser beams fire down) 
SURGEON: Again! We need a biomolecular physiologist in here. This man
is dying. 
MEDIC: Right away, sir.

LAFORGE: You've got to be kidding. 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: Come on. There's not enough juice in these to blow up a
passing asteroid. 
GREBNEDLOG: Do it. Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: I suppose we could increase the anti-matter charges. 
REGINOD: Yes. We like power. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
GREBNEDLOG: Do not try to trick us. We can tell.

(The specialist has been dragged in from the golf
course) 
PHYSIOLOGIST: Metabolation? 
SURGEON: Negative. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: Heterocyclics? 
SURGEON: Failing. And capillary integrity too unpredictable to attempt
a resect. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: You're unwilling to make the attempt?? 
SURGEON: I'm not qualified. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: I know someone who is.
