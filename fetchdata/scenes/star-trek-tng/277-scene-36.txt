[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This is amazing. The DNA in his optic
nerves is regenerating. Geordi, it's as if you're growing new eyes. 
PICARD: How is this possible? 
CRUSHER: It shouldn't be possible at all. There's no medical
explanation for spontaneous regeneration of an organ. 
OGAWA: Doctor we've just gotten reports from two crewmembers who say
they have old scars which are healing themselves. 
DATA: Captain, I believe I have a partial explanation. I have completed
my analysis of the anomaly. It appears to be a multi-phasic temporal
convergence in the space-time continuum. 
CRUSHER: In English, Data. 
DATA: It is, in essence, an eruption of anti-time. 
PICARD: Anti-time? 
DATA: A relatively new concept in temporal mechanics. The relationship
between anti-time and normal time is analogous to the relationship
between antimatter and normal matter. 
PICARD: So if time and anti-time were to collide 
DATA: They would annihilate one other, causing a rupture in space. I
believe this is what happened in the Devron system. The rupture may be
sending out waves of temporal energy which are disrupting the normal
flow of time. 
PICARD: Data, what could have caused this collision of time and
anti-time? 
[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Anti-time, sir?
PICARD: I believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an
inverse tachyon pulse, then you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture
between time and anti-time. 
DATA: That is a fascinating hypothesis. How did you formulate 
PICARD: I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do the
modifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory as
to what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly?

O'BRIEN: Approximately four hundred million kilometres in diameter,
sir. 
PICARD: I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

PICARD: What's going on? 
CRUSHER: We're under attack. 
CHILTON: Shield strength down to fifty two percent. Minor damage to the
port nacelle. 
WORF: Two Klingon attack cruisers decloaking to port and starboard. 
CRUSHER: Warp speed. Get us out of here. 
CHILTON: Warp power's offline, sir. 
CRUSHER: Heading one four eight, mark two one five. Full impulse. 
CHILTON: Impulse power's fluctuating. Shields down to thirty percent. 
PICARD: Weapons status? 
WORF: These weapons are no match for their shields. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, we need more warp power, now. 
LAFORGE: I'm trying, Captain. They're too much for us. I can't keep the
phase inducers online. 
CHILTON: Shields down to nine percent. One more hit and they'll
collapse. 
CRUSHER: Open a channel. 
CHILTON: Open. 
CRUSHER: This is Captain Beverly Picard. We are a medical ship on a
mission of mercy. Please break off all (Bang) Worf, signal our
surrender. 
WORF: Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh! 
(but they fire again, and Chilton is killed) 
WORF: Our shields have collapsed. We are defenceless. 
DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three
one oh. It's the Enterprise. 
(a three-nacelled Enterprise) 
DATA: They're hailing us. 
CRUSHER: On screen. 
RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by.
I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. 
(Enterprise phasers slice through the Klingon shields and ships.
KaBOOM!) 
WORF: The Enterprise is drawing their fire. 
CRUSHER: Damage report. 
LAFORGE: The warp core has been badly damaged. There's a breach in
progress. 
PICARD: We have to stop it! 
DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. 
RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in
progress. Prepare for emergency beam out.
