[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Data! Data, isn't this exciting? We are
going to witness a moment in history. 
DATA: Every nanosecond in this continuum is a moment in history, once
it has elapsed. 
LAFORGE: No, no, no, no. I mean, we're going to see something that
people will talk about for years. I mean, think about it. No more bulky
warp engines or nacelles. A ship just generates a Soliton wave and then
rides it through space like a surfboard. This is going to be like being
there to watch Chuck Yeager break the sound barrier, or Zephram
Cochrane engage the first warp drive. 
DATA: It should be interesting. 
WORF: Very exciting. 
LAFORGE: I'm talking to the wrong crowd. Donaldson! Donaldson, you're
an engineer. 
(moves out of shot) 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, you have a subspace communication from
the transport ship Milan. 
WORF: Transfer the signal to this station. 
HELENA [on monitor]: Hello, Worf. 
WORF: Mother. 
HELENA [on monitor]: I hope you don't mind us dropping in on you like
this, but when I heard the Enterprise was to be in this sector, we took
the first transport and here we are. 
WORF: Is father with you? 
HELENA [on monitor]: No, but I brought Alexander with me. I thought the
two of you would like a chance to visit. 
WORF: Very well. I will make arrangements for you to come aboard. 
HELENA [on monitor]: Good.
