[Engineering]

DATA: Structural reinforcement is at two hundred
forty percent. 
(a sample container is sitting on a table in the middle of the floor) 
LAFORGE: Activating containment field. Well, that should do it. Okay,
Reg. We've locked onto the coordinates of the plasma streamer. Go ahead
and beam aboard a sample, will you? 
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. 
(the container fills with pink) 
LAFORGE: Okay. What would they have done first? 
DATA: A standard analysis begins with a resonance frequency scan. 
LAFORGE: That sounds like a good place to start. Let's get it done. 
DATA: Initiating resonance sweep. Frequency range at three 
(the container blows apart) 
LAFORGE: Barclay, check the containment field. 
BARCLAY: The field is at its maximum limit, but it is holding. 
LAFORGE: My visor's picking up bio-magnetic energy. Highly complex
patterns. You know, I think these things are alive. Reg. 
(Barclay has passed out) 
LAFORGE: Reg? (Barclay has a lot of purple skin now) Reg.

BARCLAY: Life forms? 
DATA: That is correct. They appear to be quasi-energy microbes that
exist within the distortion field of the plasma streamer. 
LAFORGE: We didn't detect them until we tried to run the resonance
frequency scan. Apparently, they didn't like it very much. They
shattered the sample container. 
BARCLAY: Which caused a plasma explosion similar to the one on the
science ship. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. When we linked up with their transporter system, one
or more of the microbes must have got into our system. We think they're
still caught in the buffer. It might explain what you saw. 
BARCLAY: But what I saw was much bigger than a microbe. 
DATA: Normal spatial relationships are often distorted within the
matter stream. Your perceptions may have been exaggerated. 
CRUSHER: Some of these microbes are also in your body, Reg. 
BARCLAY: Inside me? 
CRUSHER: They were in Lieutenant Kelly's body as well. That's what
caused the contractions during the autopsy. 
LAFORGE: The biofilter should have screened them out but it didn't. 
DATA: The microbes exist simultaneously as both matter and energy. The
biofilter cannot distinguish them from the matter stream. 
LAFORGE: Right, but if we held Barclay suspended in mid-transport at
the point where matter starts to lose molecular cohesion. 
DATA: The molecules would begin to emit nucleonic particles. We may be
able to derive a pattern the computer would recognise. 
LAFORGE: And then reprogram the biofilters to screen the microbes out.
I think this'll work, Reg. 
BARCLAY: Suspend me? I don't like the sound of this. 
LAFORGE: We'd have to hold you in there for a while. 
BARCLAY: How long? 
LAFORGE: Thirty, forty seconds. It's tough to tell. But I think it'd be
safe. 
BARCLAY: But if I'm in the matter stream too long. 
DATA: Your pattern would degrade to the point where your signal would
be permanently lost.
