PICARD: Director Mandl, I put it to you again. What
do you know about these life forms? 
GUEST4: Not a thing. 
PICARD: Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive and
it must stop. You have kept information from me since our first
communication. An alien life form has taken possession of my Medical
Lab. You knew of its existence. 
GUEST4: Yes. 
GUEST3: Is this true? You knew there was life on Velara Three? 
GUEST4: I knew that there were random energy patterns, yes, I knew that.
But not life. Not by any definition I have ever heard. 
TROI: But you tried to keep that knowledge from us. 
GUEST4: No! They are meaningless silicon crystals, which rebroadcast
sunlight. 
PICARD: It is a life form and it has intelligence. 
GUEST4: Why do you say that? 
PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. 
GUEST4: Communicate with you? 
PICARD: When did you first become aware of them? 
GUEST2: Tell them about the pattern in the sand. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. Do tell us. 
GUEST2: When we first arrived, we noticed that in certain areas the
sand had a sparkling effect, like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow.
PICARD: What did you think it was? 
GUEST2: Honestly, we did not give it any thought. 
GUEST4: Picard, I must point out again that we were assured, not once
but many times, by the best scientific minds in the Federation, that
this planet has no life. No life! And we were not looking, and
therefore we did not see. 
PICARD: All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began to
understand that there was something that was different about them. 
GUEST4: You can't know that. 
PICARD: Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell me
about these patterns. 
GUEST2: At first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon unique to
Velara Three. 
GUEST4: Refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting, but certainly
not life. 
GUEST3: Why was I never told about this? 
GUEST4: Because it's not particularly important. 
GUEST2: As the building of the terraforming station went forward, the
patterns in the sand ceased being random and became very specific.
Geometric shapes suddenly appearing, disappearing, changing location,
changing size. 
PICARD: Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting to
communicate? 
GUEST4: No, never. 
PICARD: Bensen? 
GUEST2: I don't know. At the time, I didn't think so. But now, after
hearing what you just said. Now, I don't know. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we've regained magnification of the life form.
It's divided again. 
PICARD: Patch visual to Observation lounge.
(Eight round things with a bar pattern are on the screen) 
GUEST4: There was no indication of any of this on Velara Three. 
GUEST2: Absolutely none.
