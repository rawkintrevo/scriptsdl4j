[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Worf, would you escort our guest to
the transporter room? 
(Worf and Gowron enter the turbolift) 
PICARD: Begin monitoring Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone,
Mister Data. Have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. 
RIKER: Backed by Romulans? 
PICARD: I don't know. But there is too much history between the Duras
and the Romulans to discount the possibility.

[Transporter room]

WORF: Dismissed. 
(the transporter technician leaves) 
WORF: I would speak with you. 
GOWRON: I do not hear the words of traitors. 
WORF: I am not a traitor. 
GOWRON: You admitted your guilt before the Council. 
WORF: I accepted discommendation to protect the Empire. 
GOWRON: Protect it? How? 
WORF: It was Duras' father who betrayed our people to the Romulans at
Khitomer, not mine. 
GOWRON: Duras? There is proof of this? 
WORF: There is. 
GOWRON: Why would you accept dishonour to protect Duras? 
WORF: His family was too powerful. To expose him would have split the
Empire. Instead, the Council chose to blame my father. 
GOWRON: The Council knew? 
WORF: I believe you to be a man of honour, Gowron. I ask you, restore
my family name. 
GOWRON: Worf, you killed Duras. I consider that no small favour. But
what you ask is impossible. 
WORF: But after your installation 
GOWRON: The grasp of Duras reaches out from the grave. Much of the
Council is still loyal to his family. I must have the Council's support
to survive. I cannot expose their treachery. You chose to accept this
disgrace for the good of the Empire. Now you must live with your
decision, like a Klingon.

[Phaser range]

(Worf is practicing shooting moving coloured
targets when someone enters) 
WORF: Guinan? 
GUINAN: It's a little quiet down in Ten Forward, so I thought I'd get
off a little target practice. Do you mind if I join you? 
WORF: You? Practise? 
GUINAN: I like to keep my eye sharp. 
WORF: I practice at level fourteen. 
GUINAN: Guess I could come down to that level for a while. Begin
programme. 
(and Guinan gets the first target before Worf realises it has started) 
GUINAN: You know, I had a bet with the Captain that I could make you
laugh before you became Lieutenant Commander. 
WORF: Not a good bet today. 
GUINAN: I've seen you laugh. I like it. 
WORF: Klingons do not laugh. 
(he misses) 
GUINAN: Oh yes they do. Absolutely they do. You don't. But I've heard
some Klingon belly laughs that would curl your hair. 
(Guinan gets three hits, Worf gets two hits and a miss) 
GUINAN: Your son laughs. He's a Klingon. 
WORF: He is a child and part human. 
GUINAN: That's right. And you're not, you're full Klingon except you
don't laugh. 
WORF: I do not laugh because I do not feel like laughing. 
GUINAN: Other Klingons feel like laughing. What does that say about
you? 
WORF: Perhaps it says that I do not feel like other Klingons. 
(another miss) 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. 
GUINAN: Good game. Don't feel bad. I was doing this long before you
were born. So how is he? Your son. 
WORF: He is having difficulty adjusting to life on Earth. 
GUINAN: I can see where it might be hard for the little guy. Living
with humans, being Klingon. Could be very confusing. 
WORF: It will not be easy for him. 
GUINAN: No, it won't. But at some point he's going to want to know what
it's like to really be a Klingon. Just as you're learning.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
WORF: Captain, I request a leave of absence. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, request granted. 
WORF: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Lieutenant. Qapla! 
(Worf leaves) 
PICARD: And good luck.

Lieutenant Worf, personal log, stardate 44996.1. I
have located the Klingon ship on which my brother Kurn serves as
captain, and have arranged to join him.
