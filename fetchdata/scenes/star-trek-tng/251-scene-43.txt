PICARD: Be ready to stop the power transfer, Mister
Data. 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Engineering]

ALIEN 2: You must stop! 
(she touches him and they fall to the floor. time moves forward and
Data recovers) 
COMPUTER: Specified energy systems have been initialised. The power
transfer can now be engaged. 
DATA: Do not initiate that power transfer. 
ENSIGN: I'm sorry, sir. I already have. 
DATA: We must shut it down. 
ENSIGN: The transfer beam is at saturation, sir. It can't be
disengaged. 
DATA: Computer, place a level three containment field around the warp
core. 
COMPUTER: Containment field activated.

(the Romulan ship fires at Enterprise. Conn
explodes and a Romulan takes the injured crewman's place) 
RIKER: Damage report. 
CREWMAN: Shields down to twenty seven percent. 
(Riker is knocked down by more hits to the ship, and a Romulan helps
him back up) 
RIKER: Captain? 
PICARD: No time to explain, Number One. Continue the evacuation of the
Romulan ship. You'll find LaForge in the Romulan engine room. Beam him
directly to Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

(Deanna knocks Beverly out of the line of the
disrupter, and aims her own weapon) 
TROI: Step back, now. 
CRUSHER: It's all right, Deanna. He wasn't firing at me. 
ROMULAN: There was an alien here who'd taken Romulan form. I was firing
at her. The Doctor got in the way. 
CRUSHER: Where did she go?

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Status, Mister Data? 
DATA: I was attacked by another alien, sir. I was unable to prevent the
power transfer. It cannot be disengaged, sir. A core breach is again
imminent.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Can we move the ship? 
RIKER: The feedback from the transfer beam would tear us apart. 
PICARD: Patch me into the navigational control of the runabout. 
RIKER: Got it. 
PICARD: I'm bringing the runabout in. 
(he flies the runabout into the power transfer beam. KaBOOM. The
warbird vanishes) 
[Engineering]

(the alien woman vanishes) 
PICARD [OC]: Mister Data? 
DATA: The core breach has been prevented, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, it appears that severing the power
transfer has not only prevented the core breach, but has also restored 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Space-time to normal. 
DATA: The alien who attacked me has vanished, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: The warbird has vanished as well. 
DATA: Judging from the residual temporal fluctuations, I believe they
have returned to their own time continuum.
