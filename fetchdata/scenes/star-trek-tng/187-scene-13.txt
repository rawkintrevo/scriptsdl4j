bridge woman arranged vanishes expecting prim strong come succumb

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard has fallen asleep with a book. He is woken
by a strong breeze and sees Ardra standing there in a negligee. He's
not wearing much more himself.) 
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Intruder alert. Picard to Bridge. 
ARDRA: Oh, I've arranged for a bit of privacy. 
(Picard gets up and walks to the door, but it doesn't open) 
ARDRA: Just the two of us. 
PICARD: This is becoming very tiresome. 
ARDRA: Oh, come now, Picard. You know you find me tantalising. Give in
to your desires. 
PICARD: You know, there's nothing about you I find tantalising. On the
contrary, I find you obvious and vulgar. 
ARDRA: Easily fixed. (Victorian clothing) I can be your ideal woman,
Picard. Prim and proper. And chaste, until I succumb to your charms. Or
would your fantasies turn more toward a professional woman, one perhaps
who wears a Starfleet uniform? Perhaps I could even be 
TROI: Someone close at hand and yet unattainable. I can do anything for
you, Captain. Anything you could ever imagine. 
ARDRA: I could give you a night that would light fire in your dreams
until you die and you would reject me? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. 
ARDRA: You shall regret that. 
PICARD: I think not. 
ARDRA: Oh, but you will. 
(and Picard vanishes)

[Science station]

LAFORGE: Captain Picard? Captain, I wasn't
expecting you here. 
PICARD: Neither was I. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise. 
WORF [OC]: Go ahead. 
LAFORGE: Worf, Captain Picard is here.
