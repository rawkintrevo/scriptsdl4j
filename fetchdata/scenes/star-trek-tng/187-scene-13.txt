[Science station]

DATA: I cannot locate the Enterprise anywhere
within one light year of the planet, sir. 
PICARD: I don't believe Ardra is capable of transporting the Enterprise
a light year away. Keep hailing them, Mister Data. Repeat on all
frequencies. 
LAFORGE: Hey, I think we've found something here. There's a sudden jump
in Z-particle readings just about the time the Enterprise disappeared. 
PICARD: Where did it originate? 
GUEST4: It was too brief to pinpoint. 
LAFORGE: But it could suggest a hidden power source. 
PICARD: Gentlemen, we need to find that source if we are to defeat this
woman. 
LAFORGE: Well, if you can get her to perform a few more magic tricks
like that one, we just might be able to track it down. 
(Ardra appears) 
GUEST2: So, I trust you have a bit more respect for me now. 
PICARD: What have you done with my ship? 
GUEST2: I've done nothing with your ship. My ship is safely in my
possession. 
PICARD: I do not recognise your claim on the Enterprise. Nor on this
world, for that matter. In accordance with Ventaxian legal precedent, I
call for an arbitration. 
GUEST2: An arbitration? There's nothing here to arbitrate. 
PICARD: Oh, but there is. You're a fraud, madame, and I intend to prove
that you could not have affected the changes that took place on this
planet. 
GUEST2: Do you not believe what you see with your own eyes? Your ship is
gone, Captain. 
PICARD: An illusion. Magicians have been making things of all sorts
disappear for ages. 
GUEST2: You underestimate me. But then, most people do, until it's too
late. 
PICARD: If you are who you say you are, then you have nothing to lose. 
GUEST2: I also have nothing to gain. I already have possession of this
planet and your ship. 
PICARD: I am prepared to offer an added incentive. If you win, I'll
take you to the ruins of Ligillium. 
GUEST2: The Zaterl Emerald? You know where it is? 
PICARD: Yes, I do. 
GUEST2: Oh, you are too clever. But I have enough jewels. If you wish
this foolish arbitration, I will choose my own prize. 
PICARD: And what would that be? 
GUEST2: You. By all rights, your body is already mine, but I want more.
I want your heart, your mind, your soul, and I want you to give them to
me without resistance, of your own free will. So, do you still wish to
pursue this most dangerous game? 
PICARD: I agree to your terms. 
GUEST2: Oh, Picard, I will enjoy you morning, noon and night. 
PICARD: But we must agree to an arbiter. 
GUEST2: Very well. I choose Mister Data. Any objections? 
PICARD: But Mister Data is a member of my crew. 
GUEST2: Of my crew. And he's an android. He is incapable of deceit or
bias. He has no feelings to get in the way of his judgment. 
DATA: Ardra, before he responds, may I have a word in private with
Captain Picard? 
(she nods, and they cross the room) 
DATA: Sir, I request you reject me as arbitrator. 
PICARD: Why? 
DATA: Ardra is right. If I am chosen, I will perform my duties without
bias or sentiment. I cannot guarantee I will deliver a verdict in your
favour. 
PICARD: Data, where else on this planet can I find someone she cannot
intimidate? 
DATA: Sir, I will have to follow the rules of conduct for a Ventaxian
jurist. 
PICARD: I understand. You'll make a fine judge.
