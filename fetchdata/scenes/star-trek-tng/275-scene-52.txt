[Holodeck- train]

WORF: Are you all right? 
TROI: Yes. What happened? 
WORF: The Conductor accidently derailed the train. 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. 
[Cargo bay]

PICARD: Picard here. 
DATA [OC]: There has been an accident on the holodeck, sir. Has
anything happened to the Enterprise? 
PICARD: Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitude
control and most systems are offline. 
LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this. When the particle
beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy
matrix. Now, if these readings are accurate, I'd say that the emission
patterns were almost organic. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create a
lifeform? 
LAFORGE: I think so. 
PICARD: Will it survive? 
LAFORGE: Well, its energy levels are dropping rapidly. Unless it gets
an infusion of vertion particles, and I mean soon, I don't think so. 
(rumble, and Geordi checks a console) 
LAFORGE: Captain, all of our systems are back online and we're moving
again, at warp nine. 
PICARD: Let's get back to the Bridge.

[Holodeck- train]

(everything's back to normal) 
RUSTIC: Whoo wee, that was a close one, wasn't it? 
TROI: Where are we going now? 
RUSTIC: Well, New Vertiform City, of course. 
DATA: Data to Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard here. 
DATA: The train has returned to normal, sir. Our destination is New
Vertiform City.

[Bridge]

PICARD: What's our course? 
RIKER: We're heading for the Cordannas system. 
PICARD: Another white dwarf star. 
RIKER: It's the nearest one to our last position. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we have a problem. Even at warp nine, the Cordannas
system is over twelve hours from here. 
PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, but that's not the problem. The ship has diverted
all of our systems to maximum propulsion, including life support. We
have less than two hours of reserve oxygen. 
PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you
have to get control of the train. 
DATA [OC]: Understood, sir. 
PICARD: The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes that
the Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility of
anything closer? 
LAFORGE: White dwarf stars are the only natural sources of vertions,
sir. 
PICARD: Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles?

[Holodeck - train]

DATA: How did the Conductor stop the train? 
WORF: There is a braking lever in the engine room. 
TROI: Let's go. 
RUSTIC: Sorry, folks, but you ain't going nowhere.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I've narrowed the search to the MacPherson
Nebula, which is a supernova remnant, and Dikon Alpha, which is a class
nine pulsar. They're both fairly close to our current flight path and
either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified
photon torpedo inside it. 
RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think either
of these phenomena could produce enough of them? 
LAFORGE: It's really hard to say. I can't even guarantee that we can
create them at all. 
PICARD: Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar?
It's your choice, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: I say go with the nebula. 
PICARD: Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. 
RIKER: Now let's see if we can get this ship to go where we want.

[Holodeck- train]

TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what's
happening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want to
help you get there. 
RUSTIC: Well, I don't know. 
TROI: Please, we're your friends. 
RUSTIC: You're really going to help get us to New Vertiform City? 
TROI: I promise. 
RUSTIC: Okay. But just one of you. The rest stay here.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: That's far enough. 
GANGSTER: Sorry to spoil your party, pal. It's nothing personal. 
DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. 
GANGSTER: Don't listen to him. He's up to somethin'. 
CONDUCTOR: A shorter route? 
DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls. 
GANGSTER: Don't do it. 
CONDUCTOR: Well we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there
on time. All right, go on, but no funny stuff. 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room.
