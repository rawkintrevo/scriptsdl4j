[Crusher's office]

MARTIN: Anything more I can do for you? 
CRUSHER: No, thanks. I was just doing some reading on the Iresine
syndrome. If a new strain has developed, that might explain the normal
histamine count. 
MARTIN: Any luck? 
CRUSHER: Not so far. 
MARTIN: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. 
(after Martin leaves, Beverly gets a vision of a younger Picard with
some hair) 
PICARD [OC]: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
(They are visiting a morgue) 
PICARD: You don't have to do this. 
CRUSHER: It's important to me. I have to see him. To see him. To see
him. To see him. 
(on their way to the morgue) 
CRUSHER: It's good of you to come. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do. 
(they enter the morgue) 
PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
CRUSHER: I have to face the fact that he's gone. 
PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this 
CRUSHER: It's good of you to come with me. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do. 
JEV: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do 
(Picard lifts the sheet to reveal dead Jack Crusher, who then opens his
eyes and becomes Jev. Picard is now Jev. Beverly screams)

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: I've spent two hours having a cozy chat
with the computer. I've checked everything I can think of. Any possible
agent that might cause that electropathic pattern. 
DATA: I assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful. 
LAFORGE: Didn't find a thing. 
[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: Doctor Crusher's not going to be too happy
with 
(they see her slumped over her desk and run in)

[Crusher's office]

DATA: Emergency medical team to Doctor Crusher's
office immediately.

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: Doctor Crusher had me working on a
shipwide diagnostic. I'd gone to give her the results when I found her.

PICARD: Did your scans provide any insights into these comas? 
LAFORGE: None. I've checked and cross-checked. They're just dead ends. 
DATA: We seem to have eliminated the all known factors that may have
caused the comas, except for the Ullians. 
PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to investigate those eleven planets
that the Ullians visited. See if there were any reports of unexplained
comas. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: In the meantime, we must consider restricting them to their
quarters, as a precautionary measure. 
LAFORGE: If one of them is behind this, will keeping telepaths in their
quarters prevent it from happening again? 
PICARD: What else can we do? Station a guard? Set up a force field? I
don't see that those would be any more effective. 
MARTIN [OC]: Sickbay to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
MARTIN [OC]: Counsellor Troi has regained consciousness. She's asked
for you, sir. 
PICARD: I'm on my way.
