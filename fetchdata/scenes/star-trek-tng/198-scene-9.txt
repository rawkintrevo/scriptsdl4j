PICARD: Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Permission to come aboard, sir. 
PICARD: Granted. Welcome back. 
LAFORGE: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Commander La Forge is my Chief Engineer. 
KELL: Commander. 
PICARD: He's has been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence on
Risa. 
RIKER: I'm glad we got you back, Geordi. We're going to need your help
on this. 
LAFORGE: Data tells me that the Federation has been accused of aiding
Kriosian rebels. 
PICARD: We're to be presented with evidence today. We'll need your help
in analysing it. 
LAFORGE: Anything I can do. 
(walking to the turbolift) 
TROI: You had a good time. 
LAFORGE: Does it show? 
TROI: You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you. 
(Geordi and Troi enter the turbolift) 
WORF: Captain, Governor Vagh has signalled he is ready to meet with
you. 
PICARD: Very well. Advise him that we will transport sown to the
surface immediately. Ambassador. 
(Picard and Kell leave) 
DATA: Commander Riker. 
RIKER: What is it, Data? 
DATA: Our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the
E-band. 
RIKER: E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. E-band emissions are difficult to localise. 
RIKER: Collapsing protostars sometimes emit E-band bursts. 
DATA: Yes, sir. However, there are no protostars in this sector. 
RIKER: You'd better run a complete scan. Keep me posted. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
[Corridor]

LAFORGE: The Carnelians have actually done the most
work on artificial intelligence, so I spent a lot of time in their
research seminars. 
TROI: Geordi, I get the feeling that something special happened on this
vacation, and I'm not talking about computers. 
LAFORGE: Well, I did take second place in a chess tournament. 
TROI: Yes. 
LAFORGE: And I swam a lot. I worked on my back stroke. The water is
very calm on Risa. 
TROI: And? 
LAFORGE: And I walked a lot. That's all. Well, I ate enough for twelve
people. The food there is terrific. They've got a chocolate there,
Counsellor, you would love. 
TROI: And that's all?
LAFORGE: Yeah. Well, there was this 
TROI: Yes? 
LAFORGE: Her name is Jonek. But you wouldn't want to hear about that.
Better get ready for duty. Nice talking to you, Counsellor. 
 [Governor's office]

VAGH: We talk, we socialise, we waste time and the
insurrection continues to grow. These rebels need to be crushed not
coddled. 
KELL: Governor, it does not matter what you or I think. The High
Council's made its wishes clear. 
VAGH: The Council should be more interested in Federation interference.

PICARD: Governor, exactly what do you think the Federation has done? 
VAGH: Your medical supplies have been found in rebel strongholds. 
RIKER: We make no effort to restrict access to our medical supplies. 
VAGH: Are your weapons also freely available? 
PICARD: No, they are not. 
VAGH: Then explain this. 
(Picard catches the phaser rifle that is thrown at him) 
PICARD: You took this weapon from the rebels? 
VAGH: That and many more like it. 
RIKER: It does appear to be Federation issue. 
PICARD: Governor, with your permission, I would like to take this
weapon back to the Enterprise to verify its origin. 
VAGH: As you wish. I have hundreds more. 
PICARD: Even if these weapons are genuine, I can assure you that a
third party must have been involved. The Federation is not in the
business of supplying arms to rebels. 
VAGH: This is the only Klingon colony on the border of Federation
space. You cannot deny that Starfleet would be happy to see Krios gain
its independence. It would reduce your vulnerability to an attack. 
PICARD: Governor, you speak as if we are enemies, not allies. 
VAGH: And you speak the lies of a taar'chek. 
PICARD: Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka. 
KELL: Gentlemen. 
VAGH: You swear well, Picard. You must have Klingon blood in your
veins. 
KELL: Governor, I will report to you as soon as the analysis of that
weapon is complete. Captain, Commander. 
PICARD: Enterprise, three to transport.
