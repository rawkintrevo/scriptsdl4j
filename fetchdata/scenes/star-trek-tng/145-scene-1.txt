RIKER: So what did you think of the Antedeans,
Wesley? 
WESLEY: They are rather strange-looking, Commander. 
DATA: Judging a being by its physical appearance is the last major
human prejudice, Wesley. 
PICARD: Your point is well taken, Mister Data. I'm sure that to the
Antedeans, we are equally unattractive. 
WORF: Captain, we are being hailed by a small transport vessel, just
coming into range. 
TROI: Oh, my God. 
PICARD: What's the problem? 
TROI: What's she doing here? 
WESLEY: On screen, Captain. 
PILOT [on viewscreen]: Starship Enterprise, come in. 
RIKER: We have you on our viewer, pilot. 
PILOT [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, I have a passenger. A VIP passenger
who I'm ordered to 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: Oh, let me talk to them. I'm sure I'm more
articulate than that. 
TROI: Mother. 
DATA: Captain, we are receiving Starfleet orders granting a Lwaxana 
LWAXANA: Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the Fifth House, Holder of the
Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed. 
DATA: Full ambassadorial status, sir. 
RIKER: It looks like it's back into that dress uniform, sir. 
DATA: And yours as well, Commander. She is listed as representing the
Betazed government at the conference. 
TROI: Mother, please, don't do this to me. 
LWAXANA [on viewscreen]: Do what to you, Little One? Oh, Jean-Luc. What
naughty thoughts. But how wonderful you still think of me like that.
