PICARD RIKER DATA WORF

[Bridge]

(at the science station) 
RIKER: Anything? 
WORF: There are no Ferengi vessels within range of our scanners. 
DATA: Captain, I am unable to find any information on Jason Vigo's
current whereabouts. 
PICARD: What about his mother? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Miranda was trained as a botanist. She always used to talk
about running a farm one day. Maybe we should concentrate on the
agricultural areas. 
DATA: That would significantly narrow our search. The only cultivated
land is on the southern continent, and there are relatively few people
engaged in agricultural activities. 
PICARD: There cannot be many non-Camorites among them. Scan for human
life signs. 
DATA: I am detecting eight humans. Three are female. However, they are
all too young to be Miranda Vigo. 
PICARD: What about males? 
DATA: One is an infant. Another is elderly. Two are middle aged. 
PICARD: That's seven. You said there were eight. 
DATA: I am having difficulty getting a clear reading on the eighth. The
individual appears to be approximately two kilometres beneath the
planet's surface. 
PICARD: Male or female? 
DATA: Male, between twenty and thirty years old. 
RIKER: No one in their right mind would go that far underground alone. 
PICARD: Unless he were forced to. 
WORF: Captain, I am reading seismic instability in the area. He is in
danger. 
PICARD: Relay his coordinates to the transporter room. Have them beam
him aboard. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
