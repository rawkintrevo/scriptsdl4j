PEEPLES TROI VOICE LAFORGE

[Nightmare]

(Deanna is walking through a green fog, then she
starts flying. Ahead are two lights, one large, one smaller) 
VOICE: Eyes in the dark. One moon. 
TROI: Where are you? I'm coming. Where are you? 
VOICE: Eyes in the dark. One moon. Eyes in the dark. One moon circles.
See the eyes in the dark. One moon. 
TROI: Where are you? 
(then she wakes up, gasping for air)

Captain's log, stardate 44635.8. Four days have
passed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the
Brittain. I have decided we should return to Starbase two twenty, and
to that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brittain for towing.

 [Brittain Bridge]

LAFORGE: I'm going to try re-calibrating the field
generators. I still don't see why we can't get the engines started. It
just doesn't make any sense. 
PEEPLES: Someone's still here. 
LAFORGE: What did you say, Ensign? 
PEEPLES: Can't you hear it? There's someone still alive on the ship! I
heard, I mean, I thought I heard something. 
LAFORGE: The ship was searched thoroughly. There's nobody left on
board. 
PEEPLES: Sorry, sir. My mistake. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry about it. There were thirty four people were found
dead on this ship. That's enough to make anybody uneasy. 
PEEPLES: Thank you, sir.
