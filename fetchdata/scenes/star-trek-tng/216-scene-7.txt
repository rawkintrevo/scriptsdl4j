[Troi's quarters]

ALEXANDER: Why won't you let me see him? 
TROI: Alexander, I told you it's not my decision. Your father doesn't
want to 
ALEXANDER: I don't believe you. My father wants to see me. You're the
one keeping me away from him! 
TROI: I think you know that's not true. 
ALEXANDER: Then why can't I see him? 
TROI: Come here. He's been injured, and he's embarrassed. And to have
anyone see him now would make him feel worse, even if it were you. 
ALEXANDER: This is part of that Klingon stuff, isn't it. My mother
always said that Klingons had a lot of dumb ideas about honour. 
TROI: Alexander, that Klingon stuff is very important to your father. 
ALEXANDER: Well, it isn't very important to me. I don't care about
being Klingon, I just want to see my father. 
TROI: It's been a long day. Why don't you get ready for bed and we'll
talk about this again in the morning.

[Worf's private room]

TROI: Alexander is scared, confused, hurt, all
because his father is refusing to see him. 
WORF: You know why I left those instructions. 
TROI: Yes I do. It's not the Klingon way, right? 
WORF: It is a question of honour, and I would ask you that you respect
my wishes in this matter, Counsellor. 
TROI: All I care about at this moment is a little boy who's terrified
he's going to lose his father. 
(Crusher and Russell enter) 
TROI: Maybe it's time you stopped lying here worrying about your
honour, and started thinking about someone else, like your son. 
(Troi leaves) 
CRUSHER: Would you like us to come back later? 
WORF: No. Please come in, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: This is Doctor Toby Russell. She's from the Adelman
Neurological Institute. She specialises in spinal injuries like yours.
We've discussed a variety of surgical procedures. I'm afraid none of
them will repair the spinal cord, but we have found a way for you to
regain much of your mobility. We can implant a series of neural
transducers in your lower torso and legs. They're designed to pick up
the electrical impulses from your brain and stimulate the corresponding
muscles. With a little work, you can eventually regain sixty to seventy
percent of your motor control. 
RUSSELL: The first step would be to fit your legs with motor assist
units like this one. They're a training device. Once you've mastered
using them, we can move on to the implants. 
(she puts a band around his leg) 
RUSSELL: Now try to move your leg. 
(it jerks) 
CRUSHER: No, no, that's good for a first try. It will take some time
before you get used to manipulating the 
WORF: No! (rips the band off) I will not live like that. 
CRUSHER: These are very sophisticated devices. With enough time, they
will give you 
WORF: Sixty percent of my mobility. No, I will not be seen lurching
through corridors like some half-Klingon machine, the object of
ridicule and disgust. 
CRUSHER: Perhaps this all seems a bit frightening to you know. I want
you to take some time before making a decision. Think about it. 
RUSSELL: There is one other option I'd like you to consider. It's
called genetronic replication. It's still in the experimental stage,
but if it works, it will restore virtually all of your mobility and
without the need for artificial implants.
