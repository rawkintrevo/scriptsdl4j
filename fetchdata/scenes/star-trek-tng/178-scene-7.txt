[Chez Picard]

(a proper family evening meal is being served
around a table in the paneled part of the main room) 
GUEST5: Your friend Louis wants you to contact him as soon as you're
settled. 
PICARD: Is he still trying to raise the ocean floor? 
GUEST5: Oh yes, he's very excited about it. He's been made a supervisor
now, as his wife is constantly reminding anyone who'll listen. 
GUEST0: I see no good reason why the Earth should have another
subcontinent. 
PICARD: It's really quite exciting, actually, if you understand the
potential of exploring a new world on our own planet. 
GUEST0: Well, I'm afraid that I do not understand this potential. 
GUEST5: The Mayor wants to give you a parade. 
PICARD: A parade? 
GUEST5: Give you the keys to the city. 
PICARD: No. No, no, no, no. 
GUEST0: He just needs a little arm twisting, dear, coaxing. 
PICARD: No. he does not. I'm here to rest and spend some time with my
family. 
GUEST5: Well, I've already warned the Mayor not to make any plans
without talking to us. 
ALL: Salut. 
(They all taste their red wine) 
PICARD: Is this the forty six? 
GUEST0: Forty seven. You've been drinking too much of that artificial
stuff. What do you call it? Synthehol? It's spoiled you. Ruined your
palate. 
PICARD: On the contrary. I think that synthehol heightens one's
appreciation for the genuine article. 
GUEST0: Delicious, Marie. 
GUEST5: Thank you. 
PICARD: Leave it to Robert to find the best cook in France, then marry
her. 
GUEST0: Yes, but sadly cooking is becoming a lost art. That's your
wretched technology again. 
GUEST5: Robert and I have had more than a few discussions about getting
a replicator in the house. 
PICARD: I remember the same discussions between mother and father. 
GUEST0: Father understood better than anybody else the danger of losing
those values which we hold most precious. 
PICARD: I don't see that you have to lose anything just by adding a
convenience. 
GUEST0: You wouldn't, but in my view, life is already too convenient. 
GUEST5: This is a very old argument. 
GUEST6: I wrote a report on starships for school. 
GUEST5: And he won a ribbon for it. 
GUEST6: The teacher said it was one of the best he'd ever heard. 
PICARD: Good for you, Uncle. You know what? I once wrote a report about
starships when I was about your age. 
GUEST6: Did you win a ribbon too? 
PICARD: I don't recall. 
GUEST0: And I don't find your modesty very unconvincing, brother. Of
course you won the ribbon. You always did. 
GUEST6: Do you still have it? Your report. 
PICARD: No, I don't think so. 
GUEST6: Well, I still have mine. 
GUEST5: Why don't you go and get it, and then you can read it to your
uncle. 
(Rene leaves the table) 
GUEST0: It's hard enough to protect him, protect him from all that's
out there without you encouraging him. 
PICARD: I am not encouraging him. If you weren't so narrow minded, if
you allowed him to see the world as it really is 
GUEST0: You raise your own sons as you would wish, and allow me to do
the same with mine.
