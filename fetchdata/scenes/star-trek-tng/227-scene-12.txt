TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER GUINAN CLEMENS CRUSHER

[Transporter room]

CLEMENS: Where are we now? 
RIKER: The Federation Starship Enterprise. Ensign, call security. I
want an escort for this man. 
CLEMENS: Security? What for? Are you afraid I'm going to go around
stealing things? 
(Worf enters) 
CLEMENS: A werewolf! 
RIKER: It's a long story, Mister Worf. I'll brief you later. 
LAFORGE: Let's have Data's body taken to the science lab. I'll try and
re-attach the head we have. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, that head is over five hundred years old. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but it's the best chance we've got. 
RIKER: I want Mister Clemens kept under escort at all times. 
TROI: Commander, perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to take
Mister Clemens to his quarters. 
RIKER: Good idea. If you would accompany the Counsellor. 
CLEMENS: Madam, I'd be delighted. So, this is a space ship? You ever
run into Halley's comet?

(Guinan is just coming round) 
PICARD: Gently. Don't sit up too quickly. 
GUINAN: Where'd everybody go? 
PICARD: I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now. 
GUINAN: But you're still here. 
PICARD: You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right. 
GUINAN: And so you stayed for that? 
PICARD: I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far too
important to me. 
GUINAN: You know an awful lot about me. 
PICARD: Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned. 
GUINAN: So we become friends? 
PICARD: It goes far beyond friendship. 
GUINAN: Oh, but I'll have to wait almost five hundred years, and when
we meet I won't be able to tell you about this, will I? 
PICARD: No. Because for me, none of this will have happened yet. 
GUINAN: What's that? 
(Data's head) 
PICARD: That's history fulfilling itself.
