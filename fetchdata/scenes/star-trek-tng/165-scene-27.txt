DURAS PICARD KAHLEST KMPEC

[Kahlest's home]

(Picard wears a long robe and hood to disguise his
race and uniform) 
PICARD: Kahlest? 
KAHLEST: What do you want? 
PICARD: Your help. 
KAHLEST: No. 
PICARD: You don't even know what I want. 
KAHLEST: You are cha'Dich. I know. 
PICARD: Then you also know that Worf's life is at stake. 
KAHLEST: I cannot help. I am dead. A long time dead. 
PICARD: Were you with Worf's father just before the attack on Khitomer?

KAHLEST: No. My life ended on Khitomer. I served a proud family, a
strong house. All that is gone. 
PICARD: Worf is not gone. The family you served needs you again. 
KAHLEST: I cannot help. 
PICARD: Was his father a traitor? 
KAHLEST: No. Mogh was loyal to the Emperor. Mogh suspected someone of
plotting with the Romulans and followed them to Khitomer. 
PICARD: Who? Who was the traitor? 
KAHLEST: I do not know. 
PICARD: Then we have no way to prove Mogh's innocence, and Worf will
die as the son of a traitor. 
KAHLEST: You must leave now, cha'DIch. I am dead.

[Street]

(Picard is jumped by two Klingons. He manages to
draw the dagger and stabs one of them. Kahlest gets the other one in
the back) 
PICARD: My appreciation, madam. 
KAHLEST: You are brave, cha'DIch. Worf chose well. 
PICARD: Kahlest, would they recognise you? Would they know who your
are? 
KAHLEST: K'mpec would remember Kahlest. I caught his eye back then, but
he was too fat. 
PICARD: Come back with me. They won't know how much you know. You may
shake loose the truth. 
KAHLEST: I will come.

[Great Hall]

DURAS: The evidence is clear. I would ask that the
judgment stand. That Worf be condemned as the son of a traitor to the
Empire. 
K'MPEC: Worf, son of Mogh, the judgement of 
PICARD: K'mpec! 
(Picard enters with Kahlest) 
PICARD: The Mek'ba is not complete. I bring an eyewitness to the
Khitomer massacre, one who has new evidence, K'mpec. 
KAHLEST: Mogh was innocent. 
K'MPEC: Len'mat.
