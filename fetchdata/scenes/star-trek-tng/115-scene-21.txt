WORF: I think I may sneeze.
LAFORGE: A Klingon sneeze?
WORF: Only kind I know. 
(Picard and Crusher enter) 
PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge, you have command until further notice.
Please, make the proper ship's log entries. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(Geordi goes and sits in the Captain's chair) 
WORF: Scanners indicate a platinum trace. Should I notify the away
team? 
LAFORGE: Make it so. 
[Guest quarters]

TROI: Tasha. 
(Riker emerges in full local costume, left breast and chest hair to the
waist fully on show. The women find it highly amusing) 
RIKER: What do you think? 
TASHA: Well, I got to say, it's kind of sexy. 
RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. Actually it feels quite comfortable. 
[Beata's quarters]

(They also double as her private office) 
BEATA: How handsome you look. 
RIKER: Thank you, The Enterprise reports a possible location for Mister
Ramsey and the other survivors. 
BEATA: So soon? I'm impressed.
ARIEL: I suspicious. 
RIKER: You don't believe me? 
ARIEL: Not yet. I hear the words, but not the sincerity. 
BEATA: You had your opportunity to object, Ariel. You were in the
minority. 
ARIEL: After seven years, the great ship Enterprise come to repatriate
a small group of insignificant people. 
RIKER: Mistress Ariel, I hear the words but not the sincerity. 
ARIEL: You should listen more carefully. Excuse me, Mistress. I have
matters to attend to elsewhere. 
(Ariel leaves, and Trent follows) 
RIKER: With your permission, we'd like to begin our search immediately.
BEATA: By all means. But I'm sure that Counsellor Troi and the others
can do that without you. If I recall, you had a gesture of goodwill you
wished to give to me? 
RIKER: Certainly that can wait until we've recovered the survivors. 
BEATA: Are you suggesting that the women in your party are incapable of
accomplishing their task without the help of a man? 
RIKER: Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and Counsellor Troi are completely
qualified. 
BEATA: You're very generous with your praise. Inform them you will
remain here with me.
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Yar. 
[Guest quarters]

TASHA: This is Yar. 
[Beata's quarters]

RIKER: In the interests of diplomatic relations,
I'll remain here with Mistress Beata while you conduct our search.
