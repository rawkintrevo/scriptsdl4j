(Armus rises from his slick) 
ARMUS: She said you'd be back. 
RIKER: Then she is alive. 
ARMUS: For now. Why have you returned? 
RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What do
you want? 
ARMUS: Maybe I want nothing. 
RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. 
ARMUS: I still might. 
RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. 
ARMUS: If I tell you, will you give it to me? 
RIKER: I might. It depends. 
CRUSHER: I am a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends. 
ARMUS: Say please. 
CRUSHER: Please. 
ARMUS: You ask nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind.
Talk to her from here. 
CRUSHER: How? Troi, can you hear me? 
[Shuttlecraft]

BEVERLY [OC]: Deanna, are you all right? 
TROI: Beverly?

[Planet surface]

TROI [OC]: I can hear you. 
CRUSHER: Are you all right?

[Shuttlecraft]

TROI: Yes. 
[Planet surface]

CRUSHER: We've encountered some difficulty.

[Shuttlecraft]

TROI: I know. 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: She needs our help. 
ARMUS: So what. 
CRUSHER: Our friends are suffering only a few metres away, yet you
block our path. Why? 
ARMUS: You are all ungrateful. 
CRUSHER: What is he made of? 
DATA: It did not register on the tricorder. 
ARMUS: It? Does that mean I am not alive? 
DATA: No. Clearly you are some kind of intelligent form. 
ARMUS: But you said I did not register on your instrument. Perhaps your
instruments are useless. 
(Data's tricorder and phaser fly away, and Geordi's visor falls to the
ground. He gropes to find it) 
ARMUS: Don't help him. 
RIKER: Data. 
DATA: Half metre to the right, Geordi. (Armus moves it again) 
ARMUS: Aren't you going to lead him to his sight again, robot? 
DATA: No. You will just move it again, and I will not help you hurt
him. 
ARMUS: Then give it to him. I will find something else to amuse me. 
(The slick covers the shuttlecraft again)
