RIKER: Have you got a minute? 
PULASKI: Sure. 
RIKER: I wanted to apologize for my remark in Ten Forward. Your
personal is none of my business. 
PULASKI: Even if it involves your father? 
RIKER: Even if it involves my father. 
PULASKI: Did he ever tell you why he never remarried? 
RIKER: What woman would have him with an ego like that? 
PULASKI: I would have, in a cold minute. Twelve years ago, Kyle Riker
was a civilian strategist advising Starfleet in its conflict with the
Tholians. The starbase that he was operating from was attacked. None of
the base crew was expected to live, and they all died. All except your
father. Your father alone had the will to endure, to face the pain, to
live. 
RIKER: I never knew any of that about him. 
PULASKI: I've never saw a man fight so hard in all my life. 
RIKER: And you fell in love? 
PULASKI: Yes. And so did he. But marriage was out of the question. He
had other priorities. 
RIKER: His career. 
PULASKI: You know, if I were you, going out on the Ares, I'd jettison
the emotional baggage you're still carrying around.

WESLEY: Now the Klingon cultural database was very
specific on the setting. 
LAFORGE: Now let me guess. Twenty piece orchestra, magnificent
ballroom, everybody in formal wear. 
WESLEY: No, there is some unusual test of inner strength involved 
DATA: That would entail the use of Klingon painstiks. 
LAFORGE: Painstiks? Sounds lovely. 
DATA: Enduring physical suffering is considered a Klingon spiritual
test. 
LAFORGE: You mean in order for Worf to celebrate the anniversary of his
Ascension, he has to be hurt? And we have to witness this? 
DATA: We are his family.
