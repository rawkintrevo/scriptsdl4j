(Geordi is doing a presentation at the wall
monitor, using a schematic of the Yamato) 
LAFORGE: Sensor recordings reveal that what we witnessed was an
uncontrolled and catastrophic matter-antimatter mix. The magnetic seals
between the chambers collapsed and 
PICARD: Wait. Wait. That's not possible. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, it is, but a highly improbable series of events has
to take place for such a result to occur. 
PICARD: Explain. 
LAFORGE: Okay. In the event of a breach of seal integrity there's an
emergency release system which dumps the antimatter.
DATA: Apparently such a dump began, was then halted, and the
containment seals were dropped. There was still sufficient antimatter
present to lead to an explosion. 
PICARD: And so there is no evidence that a weapon was used? 
DATA: No, sir. None. 
LAFORGE: However it happened, the Yamato did it to herself. 
PICARD: Theorise. What could have caused such a catastrophic
malfunction? 
LAFORGE: I think Captain Varley may have been right. There may be a
design flaw. 
RIKER: In a Galaxy Class starship? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. It's the most sophisticated piece of machinery ever
built. Something could have been overlooked. 
PICARD: Knowing where the flaw is located, can you isolate the problem
and solve it? 
LAFORGE: We're already working on it, sir. 
PICARD: Pull any personnel you can use. 
(The men leave) 
TROI: If we have established that the Romulans were not responsible for
the destruction of the Yamato, would it not be prudent to withdraw? 
PICARD: If it is a design flaw, we're better to stay where we are and
give Geordi time to work on it. Or what happened to the Yamato could
happen to us.
