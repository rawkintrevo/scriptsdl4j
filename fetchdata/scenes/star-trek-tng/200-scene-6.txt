PICARD RIKER GOWRON WORF DATA

[Bridge]

RIKER: The Bortas is standing by, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. Gowron. This is an unexpected pleasure. 
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: I must speak with you, Picard. We will have to
move quickly if we are to be successful. 
PICARD: Successful? 
GOWRON [on viewscreen]: Yes. In preventing a Klingon civil war.

[Observation lounge]

GOWRON: The family of Duras is massing support.
They have many allies on the Council. 
PICARD: Duras died in disgrace. By Klingon tradition, his family should
share that disgrace. 
GOWRON: Their corruption has poisoned the Empire. Honour will soon have
no meaning. 
PICARD: And who speaks for his family now? 
GOWRON: Lursa and B'Etor, the sisters of Duras. 
PICARD: And they would claim the leadership of the Council? 
GOWRON: Women may not serve on the Council. 
PICARD: Then how 
GOWRON: I don't know. But they are plotting something. They have
secured the loyalty of at least three fleet commanders. Lursa and
B'Etor are feared, and fear is power. 
PICARD: I do not see what I can do to assist. 
GOWRON: You were first chosen as Arbiter of Succession because no
Klingon could be trusted. You accepted this duty and you must see it
through to the end. You must ensure my installation. 
PICARD: That is beyond my purview. 
GOWRON: You will not support me? 
PICARD: I will not step outside the traditional role of the Arbiter. 
GOWRON: And if they attempt to block my installation? 
PICARD: Then I can only assure you that I will deal with any challenge
according to Klingon law. 
GOWRON: I fear that will not be enough.

PICARD: Mister Worf, would you escort our guest to
the transporter room? 
(Worf and Gowron enter the turbolift) 
PICARD: Begin monitoring Romulan activity along the Neutral Zone,
Mister Data. Have the outpost stations send us their tactical reports. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: The Duras family are preparing to move against Gowron. 
RIKER: Backed by Romulans? 
PICARD: I don't know. But there is too much history between the Duras
and the Romulans to discount the possibility.

[Transporter room]

WORF: Dismissed. 
(the transporter technician leaves) 
WORF: I would speak with you. 
GOWRON: I do not hear the words of traitors. 
WORF: I am not a traitor. 
GOWRON: You admitted your guilt before the Council. 
WORF: I accepted discommendation to protect the Empire. 
GOWRON: Protect it? How? 
WORF: It was Duras' father who betrayed our people to the Romulans at
Khitomer, not mine. 
GOWRON: Duras? There is proof of this? 
WORF: There is. 
GOWRON: Why would you accept dishonour to protect Duras? 
WORF: His family was too powerful. To expose him would have split the
Empire. Instead, the Council chose to blame my father. 
GOWRON: The Council knew? 
WORF: I believe you to be a man of honour, Gowron. I ask you, restore
my family name. 
GOWRON: Worf, you killed Duras. I consider that no small favour. But
what you ask is impossible. 
WORF: But after your installation 
GOWRON: The grasp of Duras reaches out from the grave. Much of the
Council is still loyal to his family. I must have the Council's support
to survive. I cannot expose their treachery. You chose to accept this
disgrace for the good of the Empire. Now you must live with your
decision, like a Klingon.
