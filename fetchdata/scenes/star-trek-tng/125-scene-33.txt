CRUSHER: I've never seen anything like it before. 
DATA [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, if the situation is under control, please
report to the Bridge. 
WORF: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: It's okay. He won't be waking up for a long time. 
[Ante room]

PICARD: Continue, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: By the placement of the tendrils

CRUSHER: The parasite appears to stimulate the
victim's adrenal glands, generate great strength

PICARD: Never mind the details. Can you remove it? 
CRUSHER [OC]: I don't think so. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Not without killing the patient. Captain. 
[Ante room]

CRUSHER [OC]: You must set your phaser on kill.
Stun has little effect. 
PICARD: Doctor, one does not beam down to Starfleet Headquarters armed.

REMMICK: Your food is getting cold, Captain. 
PICARD: I'm going in to dinner now, Doctor. Tell Commander Riker to
join me as soon as he's ready. Picard out.

[Dining room]

(Three curved tables with two chairs each, to form
a circle. There is a covered bowl in front of each person) 
AARON: Please, sit down, Captain. We've been waiting. Go ahead and
start, Captain. We don't stand on ceremony here. 
(The bowl contains live mealworms. Picard recoils) 
AARON: Oh do eat up, Picard. Raise your hand if you want seconds. 
(Picard gets up and starts to back out of the room) 
PICARD: Riker! Thank God. We're leaving. 
RIKER: You're not going anywhere. You'll be one of us soon. 
AARON: You were meant for the Doctor. 
RIKER: It couldn't be helped. Riker walked in on us unexpectedly. 
(Aaron checks the back of his neck. The gill is there) 
SAVAR: No matter. The Doctor will soon be joining us. All in good time.

(Tryla Scott enters) 
SAVAR: Well, Captain Scott. Good. Now the setting is complete. 
AARON: You don't really think we were in the dark about your
intentions, do you? 
SAVAR: Patience is one of our virtues, Captain. We didn't go after you,
we allowed you to come after us. 
AARON: More dramatic that way, don't you think? 
TRYLA: Yes, the one thing both races share is a love of theatre. And
you've put on a fine show. 
PICARD: What race are you? Where are you from? 
SAVAR: It's not important. Let us just say we've come a long way to
join you. 
TRYLA: It's a perfect match. We're the brains, you're the brawn. 
RIKER: You'll understand soon, Picard. 
SAVAR: Indeed. We've been moving slowly, cautiously, for many months
now. Careful to cover our tracks. Careful not to arouse suspicion,
until it's too late. 
RIKER: And now it's too late. For you, that is. 
AARON: Well said, brother. Picard and Riker control the Enterprise,
which means we control the Enterprise. 
SAVAR: Eat hearty, brother! Relish your new body! 
(Riker takes a handful of mealworms, and is about to eat them when
instead he draws his phaser and shoots the other person sitting
opposite. Picard disarms Tryla Scott so Riker can shoot her, Aaron runs
out, the parasite leaves Tryla and Savar neck-pinches Riker. Picard
shoots Savar before Riker passes out) 
PICARD: Aaron!

[Hallway]

PICARD: Aaron! 
(They dodge his phaser blast and the two of them shoot the Admiral in
the back. His purple parasite comes out of his mouth and scuttles under
a nearby door. They follow it)
