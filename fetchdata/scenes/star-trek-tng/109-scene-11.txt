CRUSHER: What do you intend to do about my son? 
PICARD: He's being held safely until sundown. 
CRUSHER: When he faces execution! Although he's committed no crime,
certainly none that any sane and reasonable person would 
PICARD: You saw what that thing was about to do. 
CRUSHER: I apologise, sir, but this is very difficult for me. If he
were your son, you'd be as frightened 
PICARD: But I am. 
CRUSHER: Data is in Sickbay here. You'll find him able to talk to you.

[Sickbay]

MEDIC: He's checking out fine, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. Finish it later, please. 
DATA: I was an excellent choice for them, Captain. They were able to
communicate with me quite. I was about to say quite easily, but there
was nothing easy about it. Fortunately, they stopped short of
overloading my circuitry. 
PICARD: You're saying they. It is a vessel of some sort. 
DATA: Definitely not a single entity if that's what you mean, sir,
although they know the Edo worship them as a god thing. 
PICARD: They know? 
DATA: They recognise that this is quite expected and harmless at the
present Edo stage of evolution. 
PICARD: What sort of vessel? 
DATA: It is perhaps not what we would understand as a vessel, sir. The
dimensions this one occupies allows them to be, well, to be in several
places at once. But they consider this entire star cluster to be
theirs. It was probably
unwise of us to attempt to place a human colony in this area. Of
course, there are three thousand four other planets in
this star cluster in which we could have colonised. The largest and
closest 
PICARD: Data, don't babble. 
DATA: Babble, sir? I'm not aware that I ever babble, sir. It may be
that from time to time I have considerable information to communicate,
and you may question the way I organise it. 
PICARD: Please, organise it into brief answers to my questions. We have
very little time. Do they accept our presence at this planet? 
DATA: Undecided, sir. 
PICARD: Data, please, feel free to volunteer any important information.

DATA: I volunteer that they are now observing us, sir. 
PICARD: To judge what kind of life forms we are? 
DATA: No, it is more curiosity, sir. I doubt that they expect us to
abide by their value systems. 
PICARD: Do they know of our Prime Directive? 
DATA: They know everything I know, sir. 
PICARD: And, if we were to violate the Prime Directive, how 
CRUSHER: That's not a fair question. 
PICARD: How would they react? 
DATA: It would be a case of judging us by our own rules, sir. If we
violate our own Prime Directive, they might consider us to be deceitful
and untrustworthy. You do recall they cautioned us not to interfere
with their children below. What has happened? 
CRUSHER: The Edo want to execute my son. I will not allow that to
happen, Jean-Luc. 
DATA: Most interesting, sir. The emotion of motherhood, compared to all
others felt by 
CRUSHER: Shut up! 
(Beverly storms out) 
DATA: You were right, sir. I do tend to babble.

Captain's log, stardate 41255.9. Whatever the
object or vessel in orbit with us, it hangs there like a nemesis. It is
one thing to communicate with something mysterious, but it is quite
another to be silently observed by it. I am concerned whether it
understands the same concept of reason that we do?
