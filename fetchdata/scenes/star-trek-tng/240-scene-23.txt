DESEVE TROI WORF PICARD MEDIC RIKER NVEK

[Bridge]

(the warbird decloaks) 
WORF: Captain, we are being hailed. 
PICARD: On screen. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: I am Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar. 
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: How can we be of help? 
PICARD: A Corvallen freighter has been destroyed not far from here. We
have detected the residual effects of disruptor fire. Can you shed any
light on this? 
TROI [on viewscreen]: A regrettable incident, Captain. The freighter
was fired upon by the former Commander of this vessel. I have now taken
control, and I assure you there will be no more attacks. 
PICARD: Still, there was a considerable loss of life. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: Captain, we do not want to exaggerate this
incident. You and I can discuss it calmly. We can diffuse it before it
becomes inflated. 
PICARD: I agree. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: I will come onto your ship. Please, lower your
shields and prepare to beam me aboard. 
PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf, lock onto Major Rakal. Transport on my
command. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: Thank you. 
(transmission ends) 
RIKER: What's she doing on that ship? 
PICARD: I don't know, Number One, but she needs our help to get back.
Mister Worf, keep your lock on her no matter what happens. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Lower shields. 
[Warbird bridge]

N'VEK: Their shields are dropping. 
TROI: Activate forward disruptor array. Fire when ready. 
N'VEK: Yes, Major. Firing. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, they have fired on us. 
(three figures are beamed onto the bridge) 
PICARD: Shields up. Stand by phasers. Damage report. 
WORF: We sustained a direct hit, but the damage was negligible. The
disruptor had almost no power. 
DESEVE: This is Proconsul M'ret and his aides. They're part of the
underground movement. 
RIKER: They're in stasis. Medical team to the Bridge. 
MEDIC [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Where's Deanna?
