(using the optical cable as a rope, the group have
climbed up to the next deck) 
PICARD: I can't open this door. We're going to have to climb up to the
next deck. 
PATTERSON: What if that one doesn't open either? 
JAY GORDON: Then we'll never get out. 
MARISSA: Quiet, both of you. That's an order. 
PICARD: We're going up. Ready? 
MARISSA: Ready, sir. 
(everything shakes) 
PICARD: The lift's falling! Hang on! 
PICARD: We're all right. We're going to keep on climbing. Just don't
look down. 
JAY GORDON: What's wrong? 
MARISSA: He's scared. 
PICARD: We're right with you, Patterson. You're not going to fall.
Everything will be all right if you just keep climbing.
What we need is a climbing song. Marissa, is there a song you sing at
school? 
MARISSA: The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog? 
PICARD: I'm afraid I don't know that one. I know. Frere Jacques. That's
a song I used to sing when I was at school. Patterson, do you know that
one? Good. It goes like this. Frere Jacques, Frere Jacques, dormez
vous? Dormez vous? 
ALL: Sonnez les matines, sonnez les matines, ding ding dong, ding ding
dong. 
PICARD: Very good. Now, keep singing. 
ALL: Frere Jacques, frere Jacques, dormez vous? Dormez vous? Sonnez les
matines, sonnez les matines. Ding ding dong, ding ding dong. Frere
Jacques, frere Jacques, dormez vous? Dormez vous? Sonnez les matines,
sonnez les matines. Ding ding dong, ding ding dong.
Frere Jacques, frere Jacques

WORF: Your contractions are now only thirty seconds
apart. Dilation has gone to seven centimetres since the onset of
labour. That did not take long. 
KEIKO: That's easy for you to say. 
WORF: You are doing very well. I am sure the child will arrive soon. 
KEIKO: Worf, has the baby turned? 
WORF: Turned? 
KEIKO: So the head is down. Doctor Crusher told me a few days ago that
it hadn't. She wasn't worried because I still had a month to go. 
WORF: I am not certain. Can't you tell? 
KEIKO: Worf, have you ever done this before?, delivered a baby? 
WORF: Yes. No. I have taken the Starfleet Emergency Medical Course. In
a computerised simulation, I assisted in the delivery of a human baby. 
KEIKO: Sometimes it doesn't go by the book, Worf. 
WORF: I am sure everything will be fine.
