PICARD: Has there been any damage to the ship? 
[Bridge]

RIKER: There was an emergency reported in Ten
Forward. Mister Worf's on his way. 
LAFORGE: Captain, there's some kind of energy pulse coming through the
tractor beam. 
[Data's quarters]

LAFORGE [OC]: It's overriding our control systems. 
PICARD: I'll be right there. 
DATA-BOY: (gripping Picard's wrist) Don't leave me. 
PICARD: I won't leave you. Please, let go of me. 
DATA-BOY: Does it hurt? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA-BOY: She's going to hurt us all. 
(he lets go) 
DATA-IHAT: Now you've done it, Captain. Masaka is awake.

[Ten Forward]

(it now contains tropical foliage and stone, and a
large version of Troi's ornament with a sun image on it. Think lost
Mayan ruins.) 
TROI: Who's this? 
PICARD: I'd say that that is Masaka. Ihat referred to her as a queen,
and it's not unusual in ceremonial cultures to find royalty symbolised
by a sun. 
TROI: You said the personalities inside Data were in awe of her, even
terrified. 
PICARD: According to Data, the sun image is also a symbol for death. 
(on the reverse of the obelisk) 
PICARD: There it is again. The same U-shaped symbol, small and
insignificant. Almost as if it's an afterthought. 
LAFORGE: Captain, this is incredible. These artefacts weren't beamed
over here from the archive. The matter here in Ten Forward has been
transformed. 
PICARD: Into living plants? How is that possible? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure. But bit by bit, this ship is being transformed. 
WORF: We have been receiving reports from the rest of the ship. Part of
deck twelve is now an aqueduct. 
TROI: What are we being transformed into? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure I want to find out. 
PICARD: I don't think we have a choice. We must destroy that archive.
Mister Worf? 
WORF: Sir, our weapon control systems are inoperative. However, we
could reconfigure a photon torpedo for manual launch. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
(Worf and La Forge leave) 
PICARD: There's so much here we could have learned. I really regret
losing that opportunity.

[Engineering]

(a torpedo lies on the floor) 
LAFORGE: Okay, I've locked in the targeting parameters. What's the
phase alignment now? 
WORF: Less than point seven percent. 
LAFORGE: Good, that'll do it. I'm setting the yield at maximum. 
(and the torpedo lights go out) 
WORF: Sir, the onboard power systems are not functioning. 
LAFORGE: Let's see what's going on here? 
(the torpedo is full of snakes, Masaka is on the wall monitor and there
are vines) 
LAFORGE: Something tells me we'd better get out of here. 
(flames stop them) 
WORF: Engineering to Bridge. Emergency transport. Two to beam out.
