PICARD: How many devices do we think we're dealing
with, Mister Data? 
DATA: To create this radiation field would take several hundred
thousand, sir. 
RIKER: They've been out there a long time, Data. There must have been
some deterioration. 
DATA: There is no way to precisely calculate that, Commander, but it is
likely. 
PICARD: Is there any indication of a weakness in a specific part of the
field? 
WORF: Nothing substantial, Captain. 
PICARD: Of any kind. 
WORF: There is a point one percent dip in the strength of the radiation
field at two one mark eight by four two mark zero. 
PICARD: I want that point one percent. 
RIKER: I recommend we fire directional phasers at those coordinates. 
LAFORGE: We won't be able to maintain energy reserves. We might even
lose a few circuits in the new configuration. 
PICARD: How critical will the losses be? 
LAFORGE: Not enough to shut down our engines, but if we don't make it I
don't know that I can hold the shields. 
DATA: There is also the possibility that the phasers will supply the
assimilators with what they need most. Energy. 
PICARD: You know, I imagine a very similar discussion taking place on
our neighbour ship over a thousand years ago. Let's hope our decisions
are more successful than theirs were. Mister La Forge, I want you to
return to Engineering and continue with your efforts without delay.
Mister Worf, prepare the phasers. 
WORF: Phasers locked on coordinates. 
PICARD: Fire. 
RIKER: Nothing. 
WORF: Radiation levels increasing. Eight percent. Ten percent. 
DATA: Energy reserves are dropping rapidly, sir. 
PICARD: Damn you.

LAFORGE: Wouldn't that increase the output of the
subspace processors to gain a quicker response time? 
LEAH: The processors can handle the extra input. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but how do we reconfigure? 
COMPUTER: Energy reserves reaching critical stage. Standard procedure
requires termination of all simulations. 
LAFORGE: Computer, override standard procedure. 
COMPUTER: Override authority restricted. 
LAFORGE: What? Computer!

(Sitting in the light of the stars) 
LAFORGE [OC]: The crystal lattice is breaking down. We'll have to pick
up repairs when we can reach a starbase.
RIKER: The optimist of the group. 
PICARD: How long do we have shields based on current calculations? 
WORF: Under two hours, Captain. And the radiation field has increased
by seventeen percent. 
PICARD: So what impact will that have on fatal exposure? 
CRUSHER: Down to twenty six minutes. 
RIKER: If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energy
usage? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. In fact, I need to get some
back. I'm running a programme on holodeck three. 
[Observation lounge]

PICARD: For what purpose? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Well, I've gone back to the beginning 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: To the earliest construction entries of
the Enterprise. I've created a propulsion design model to assist me.
