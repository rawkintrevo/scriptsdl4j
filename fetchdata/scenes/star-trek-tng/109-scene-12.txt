[Lounge]

DATA: You sent for me, sir? 
PICARD: Let's have more talk, Data. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Sit down. 
DATA: What level of communication, sir? 
PICARD: Any. My apologies for saying that you babbled. 
DATA: But I do, sir. 
PICARD: You also see things in a way we do not, but as they truly are.
I need help, my friend. I cannot permit that boy or any member of this
vessel be sacrificed. The Prime Directive never intended that. 
DATA: The problem, sir, is there. (the Edo vessel) Although they've
learned of the Prime Directive from my mind, how will they evaluate it?
How do they reason? What are their values? Remember their warning to
us, sir. 
PICARD: Exactly. How do I explain my refusing to obey their laws down
there. Not permitting the Crusher boy to be executed. And by so doing
do I endanger this vessel and more than a thousand other lives? 
DATA: Would you choose one life over one thousand, sir? 
PICARD: I refuse to let arithmetic decide questions like that. Did you
learn anything about the relationship between that and the Edo? Why are
they so certain it's a god? 
DATA: Any sufficiently advanced life form would appear to others to be
that, sir. But when they were probing my thoughts, Captain, I could
feel that whatever they are now, they once existed in this dimension,
just as we do. Perhaps in the same kind of flesh and blood form. Since
then, however, they have evolved considerably. Their present existence
in multi-dimensions no doubt has advantages we do not understand. 
PICARD: Then in some earlier flesh and blood form they might have
shared our kind of values. 
DATA: We know the Edo share them, sir. 
PICARD: Why would such an advanced thing feel obliged to protect the
Edo? 
DATA: Perhaps the Edo are a child race by comparison. Possibly a race
which those life forms have planted here. Much as we plant human
colonies on Class-M planets. 
(Crusher enters) 
CRUSHER: Having fulfilled my professional obligations regarding
Commander Data 
PICARD: You now request permission to beam down to the planet.
Permission granted. You can accompany me while I try and resolve this.
And you should know that whatever the cost, I will not allow them to
execute your son. 
CRUSHER: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Data, take command. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
