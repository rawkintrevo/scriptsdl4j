[Ready room]

MACET: I deeply regret what my aide has done,
Captain. You have my word he will be disciplined upon my return. 
PICARD: You may take whatever action against him you feel is
appropriate. I consider the matter closed. 
MACET: I'm not sure I would be so generous in your place, Captain.
Thank you. 
PICARD: If there is to be a lasting peace, Gul Macet, neither you nor I
must allow any one man to undermine our efforts. 
MACET: There are those who crave war, who need it. I am not one of
them, Captain, and I'm beginning to see that neither are you. We have
had our full measure. The lasting peace begins here, with the two of
us. 
DATA [OC]: Bridge to Captain. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
DATA [OC]: We have located the Phoenix, sir. We will intercept it in
twenty two minutes.

Captain's log, stardate 44431.7. We have

come on board. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker,
First Officer. 
MAXWELL: I know all about you, Commander. Fine work you did with the
Borg. We all owe you on that one. 
RIKER: Thank you, sir. 
MAXWELL: O'Brien? Miles O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN: Hello, Captain. Good to see you again. 
MAXWELL: How are you? I had no idea you were on the Enterprise. This
was my Tactical Officer on the Rutledge. Best I ever had. 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. 
MAXWELL: O'Brien has the ability to size up a situation instantly, then
come up with options to fit all contingencies. Remarkable. 
O'BRIEN: Well, if that's true, I learned it from you, sir. 
MAXWELL: But you got that silver tongue by kissing the stone, right?
Well, Commander, best I see your Captain straight away. We've got a lot
to talk about. 
RIKER: Yes, sir.
