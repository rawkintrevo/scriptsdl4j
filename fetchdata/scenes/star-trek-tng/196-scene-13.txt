[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Five seconds. Four. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Three seconds. Now. Shock wave patterns
within predicted range. Seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma
radiation levels. Helium
fusion rate increasing. 
TIMICIN: What about heat and pressure levels? 
LAFORGE: Steady so far. Density at eleven hundred grams per cubic
centimetre. Temperature approaching sixty million degrees Kelvin. 
TIMICIN: We want it to stabilise at two hundred and twenty million.
