are dancing, others strolling with glasses of drink. One man is getting
a massage)

DATA: I've traced it through our sensor channel,
sir It is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction. 
LAFORGE: Confirmed by my readings, Captain. It's a shadow something. 
DATA: Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. 
PICARD: What is, Commander? 
DATA: Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm
relays, sir. 
PICARD: Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander.

identify yourself. 
(And something appears) 
LAFORGE: Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser banks ready.

LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
