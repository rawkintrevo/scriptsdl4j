[Transporter room]

(Riker leaves) 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Transporter room three. I'm ready to go. 
O'BRIEN: Stand by, Commander.

[USS Yosemite]

(Geordi is beamed away) 
BARCLAY: Barclay to Enterprise. One to beam back. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by, sir. 
(We join Reg in the transporter experience, including a maggot thing
that bites his arm)

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: You see, sir? That wasn't so bad, was it.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Mission logs, science logs, medical logs,
they're all scrambled. Looks like the blast wiped out the ship's core
memory. 
BARCLAY: We could try to reconstitute the data stream. 
LAFORGE: It's worth a try. 
BARCLAY: Commander, has anything strange ever happened to you during
transport? 
LAFORGE: Like what? 
BARCLAY: I don't know. Anything out of the ordinary. 
LAFORGE: No, not really. This looks hopeless. We're not going to get
anything out of these logs. You know, maybe this broken sample
container I found can tell us something. Let's try to get this thing
back into one piece. 
BARCLAY: I mean, have you ever seen anything? 
LAFORGE: Where? 
BARCLAY: In the, during transport. 
LAFORGE: Sometimes my visor picks up resonance patterns from the matter
energy conversion. It's actually kind of pretty. Why? 
BARCLAY: Just wondering. 
LAFORGE: Reg, what are you getting at? Did you saw something during
transport? 
BARCLAY: When I was returning to the Enterprise I could've sworn I saw
something in the matter stream. 
LAFORGE: Something? 
BARCLAY: There was phased matter all around. At first I thought it was
some kind of energy discharge, but then it flew toward me and it
touched my arm. How could something be in there? Molecules flying
apart, half phased? I mean, it's impossible, isn't it? 
LAFORGE: We'd better check it out. When we're done here, we'll run a
full diagnostic on the transporter, all right? 
BARCLAY: All right.
