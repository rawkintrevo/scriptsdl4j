(the girls climb down a short ladder) 
RO JR: This is it. Main Engineering. Now we wait.

[School room]

(Alexander returns) 
PICARD JR: Report? 
ALEXANDER: Mission accomplished, sir. The one in sickbay never saw me. 
PICARD JR: Very good. 
KEIKO JR: I'd say we're ready. Have you figured out how to get to the
Bridge? 
PICARD JR:: I'm afraid I can only think of one way. 
[Corridor]

BERIK: What do you want? 
PICARD JR: I need to see my father. 
BERIK: Go back inside. 
PICARD JR: I need to see him right now. 
BERIK: Do not argue with me. Go back inside. 
PICARD JR: I need to see him now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now! Now!
Stop it! You've hurt me! I want my father! I want my father! 
BERIK: All right. Just stop that.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD JR: Let me go! 
BERIK: Here he is. Now be quiet! 
RIKER: What is going on? 
PICARD JR: Dad! 
(and throws his arms around Riker's waist) 
RIKER: So, son, how are you? 
PICARD JR: I'm okay. 
RIKER: And how are your friends, Keiko, Guinan and Ro? 
PICARD JR: They're okay too. But 
RIKER: What's wrong? 
PICARD JR: We don't have anything to do. None of the games are working.

RIKER: I know. The Ferengi made Daddy turn off the main computer. 
PICARD JR: Can't you just turn on the kid's computer in schoolroom
eight? We just want to play a few games. 
RIKER: I don't know if they'll let me do that, Jean-Luc, but I will
ask. 
PICARD JR: Thanks, Number One. He's my number one Dad.

[School room]

CHILD: Here they come. 
KEIKO JR: How did it go? Did Commander Riker get the message? 
PICARD JR: He understood. We should have access very soon.

[Ready room]

LURIN: Come in. 
LURIN: I understand your son was here to see you. 
RIKER: That's right. 
LURIN: We Ferengi do not bring our offspring along with us aboard ship.

RIKER: Then I suppose that's your loss. We consider our families one of
our strengths. 
LURIN: I think you will find that they can also be a weakness. Unless
you release the computer to our control, I will execute every child on
this ship, beginning with yours. 
RIKER: Even you wouldn't be that cruel. 
LURIN: It is cruel to put children in danger by bringing them aboard a
starship in the first place. 
RIKER: All right. Just so you don't harm my son. 
LURIN: You will release the computer and show Morta exactly how to use
it.

(at a science station) 
RIKER: Computer, release command control this station. Authorisation,
Riker Omega three. 
COMPUTER: Command functions restored. 
RIKER: Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by
three primary main processing cores, cross-linked with a redundant
melacortz ramistat. fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The core
element is based on an FTL nanoprocessor with twenty five bilateral
kelilactirals, with twenty of those being slaved into the primary
heisenfram terminal. Now you do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is? 
MORTA: Well, of course I do, human. I am not stupid. 
RIKER: No, of course not. This is the isopalavial interface which
controls the main firomactal drive unit. Don't touch that. You'll blow
up the entire firomactal drive. 
MORTA: What? Wait. What is a firomactal drive? Just explain it to me. 
RIKER: That is the firomactal drive unit. It controls the ramistat core
and also keeps the ontarian manifold at forty thousand KRGs. 
(and with his other hand he puts sneaky commands into the computer) 
RIKER: The firomactal drive is powered by
