PICARD RIKER CRUSHER WORF COMPUTER

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: His vital functions are overworked. His
immune system is under attack. I can only guess that he's suffering
from classic rejection syndrome. 
PICARD: Is there any treatment you can give him? 
CRUSHER: I can administer an immunosuppressant. That could help relieve
the symptoms but it Can't correct the underlying cause. There is a
foreign organism in his body. Medical school didn't exactly prepare me
for situations like this. 
PICARD: You're doing all you can. 
CRUSHER: Don't worry about me, Captain. I'm fine. 
PICARD: Ambassador, when you feel up to it, would you join me in my
Ready room? 
RIKER: Of course. 
(Picard leaves) 
CRUSHER: I'm giving you something that should help with the pain. At
least for a little while. 
RIKER: The pain's gone. Thank you. 
(he takes her arm) 
CRUSHER: Please don't. 
RIKER: Please let me touch you, just for a moment. 
(he leans in for a kiss) 
CRUSHER: No. Please.

[Ready room]

PICARD: It was a fast decision, which we must take
as positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly.
to let you mediate the dispute. 
RIKER: I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're just
trapped in their own anger. 
PICARD: I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goes
wrong in the discussion. 
RIKER: Then it's my job to see nothing goes wrong. Did I said something
wrong, Captain Picard? 
PICARD: No, it's just that for a moment you sounded more like Will
Riker. We have received information that the new host will arrive in
eighteen hours. Will you be all right until then? 
RIKER: The medication Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find a
way to keep going. 
[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: Lemon tea.

[Odan's quarters]

RIKER: Computer, location of Doctor Beverly
Crusher. 
COMPUTER: Doctor Crusher is in her quarters. 
RIKER: Can you make balso tonic? 
COMPUTER: There is no formula on record. Please supply a molecular
structure. 
RIKER: Never mind. 
(Beverly stares at the red rose, then makes a decision) 
RIKER: Come in. 
CRUSHER: I thought I should see how you were doing. If you needed
another hypospray? 
RIKER: I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. 
CRUSHER: Oh. Well, that's good. 
RIKER: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Tomorrow's an important day. Do you feel ready for it? 
RIKER: I'll be fine. I've been preparing. 
CRUSHER: That's good. 
RIKER: Yes. 
CRUSHER: I'll check your vital signs in the morning before the
representatives get here. 
RIKER: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication. 
CRUSHER: Maybe you could schedule a series of breaks. 
RIKER: That's good. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
RIKER: Beverly, I want you. If you're going to leave, you'd better go
right now. 
CRUSHER: I'm not leaving.

Captain's log, stardate 44824.4. Governor Leka and
the representatives of the two moons are ready to transport on board.
We have learned that they each have troops massed and are ready for
combat if this final effort at peace is not successful.

[Ready room]

CRUSHER: White count is back up, temperature is
elevated. The effects of the medication are wearing off faster every
time. I'll administer one now and hope that it will hold for an hour or
two. 
RIKER: No, no more. 
PICARD: Ambassador, it's clear you're in pain. You can't get through
the next hours without help. 
RIKER: I must. 
CRUSHER: Are the injections damaging to the host's body, Riker's body? 
RIKER: Yes. We can't put him through any further risk. 
CRUSHER: But how can you function, conduct the meeting? 
RIKER: I'll manage. 
PICARD: We'll respect your wishes. 
RIKER: One more thing. I will conduct the mediations today, but at the
end of today, regardless of the outcome, I must be removed from Riker's
body. Even if the new host has not arrived. 
CRUSHER: But you wouldn't survive. 
RIKER: Riker will not survive if I am removed. He has done enough. Your
word. 
CRUSHER: Very well. 
WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? 
WORF [OC]: The Governor and the two representatives have returned. I
will escort them to the Observation Lounge. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
(Riker-Odan totters out) 
CRUSHER: I'll stand by with the medication, just in case. The pain may
become so intense that I'll have to 
PICARD: Beverly. Whatever else I may be to you, I am your friend. I can
only imagine what you're going through, and I want you to know I'm
here. 
(they hug) 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc.
