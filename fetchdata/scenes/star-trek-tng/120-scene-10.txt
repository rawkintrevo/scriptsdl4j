PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE

[Batris Corridor]

LAFORGE: That's Commander Riker. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Ah, to me it's just an undefined form,
standing in a visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneous
information? 
LAFORGE [OC]: No, I get it all simultaneously. 
PICARD: But it's just a jumble. 
[Batris Corridor]

PICARD [OC]: How can you make head or tail of it? 
LAFORGE: I select what I want and then disregard the rest. 
PICARD [OC]: But how is that possible? 
LAFORGE: Well, how, in a noisy room, can you select one specific voice
or sound? 
PICARD [OC]: Of course, something you learn. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: It's something I have learned. Does
that make it more clear?
PICARD: Look over at Data. There's an aura around Data. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Well, of course. He's an android. 
PICARD: You say that as if you think that's what we all see. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Don't you? 
[Batris Corridor]

RIKER: Sir, I hate to break this up, but 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, Number One. Proceed. 
[Batris Corridor]

RIKER: Let's go. 
(As they move on, a conduit falls. This ship is ready to fall apart) 
DATA: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from the
leakage in the drive system. 
RIKER: Toxic? 
DATA: Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far side
of Engineering. 
RIKER: What's the safest way around? 
DATA: All routes are equally dangerous, sir. 
LAFORGE: Well, what's the least dangerous route, Data? 
DATA: There is no significant difference. 
RIKER: Steady on. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker! Commander. 
RIKER: Yes, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: There's a fissure developing in the bulkhead. The skin of the
ship is losing its integrity. 
RIKER: Where is it? I can't see it. 
LAFORGE: Right there.
