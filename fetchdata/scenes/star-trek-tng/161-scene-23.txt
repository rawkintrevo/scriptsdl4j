(The fuzzy thing can be seen through the windows,
but Q is sulking and doesn't notice it) 
VOICES: What's that? I don't know. 
GUINAN: Calamarain. 
(A white globe comes through the window and envelopes Q. He leaps up,
trying to brush it off) 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, we're being hit by a field of
energetic tachyons penetrating the hull. Location, deck ten, forward. 
PICARD: Red alert. 
RIKER: Geordi, increase power to shields. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Increasing power by twenty percent 
WORF: No effect 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Increasing to forty percent. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Still no effect

[Ten forward]

(Data tries to assist Q, but encounters static
electricity and a possible forcefield) 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Adjusting shield harmonics, diverting
power to the forward grids.

[Bridge]

WORF: The added harmonics are blocking the tachyon
field.

[Ten forward]

(Q is freed, and falls to the floor) 
Q: Help me! Somebody, help me! 
GUINAN: How the mighty have fallen.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have sustained
light damage from an attack by an alien species known as the
Calamarain. They apparently have a grievance with Q. No doubt one of
many lifeforms that do.
