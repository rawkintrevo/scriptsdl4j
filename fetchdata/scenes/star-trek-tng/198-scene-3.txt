KELL WORF
lie attacks challenge high personal wrong furnishing apologies rebel

[Tactical area]

KELL: There have been two rebel attacks on neutral
freighters. One a Ferengi, the other Cardassian. 
WORF: Both were engaged near the Ikalian asteroid belt. That's where
the rebels must be hiding. 
KELL: The actinides in the asteroids provide positive protection
against our sensors. 
WORF: They might attack a freighter, but I doubt they would challenge a
Federation starship. 
KELL: Especially with the Federation furnishing them support. 
WORF: You would test the Captain's word with me, Kell? Is it because I
have no honour in your eyes that you expect me to be disloyal? 
KELL: Wrong of me to ask. My apologies. 
WORF: Captain Picard does not lie. If he says there is no Federation
assistance to the rebels, there is none. 
KELL: Good. Because I risked my own reputation and honour coming to
Picard. 
WORF: He will not disappoint you. If that is all. 
KELL: There are some members of the High Council who would thank you,
Worf. 
WORF: Thank me? 
KELL: For killing Duras. No doubt that had he lived, one day he would
ascended to head the Council. Many were not looking forward to that. 
WORF: My motives were personal, not political. 
KELL: Motives? Who cares for motives? Humans perhaps. What matters is
you acted that day as a true Klingon.
