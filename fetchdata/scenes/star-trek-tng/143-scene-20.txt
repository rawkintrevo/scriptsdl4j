 [Pakled ship]

REGINOD: You are good. 
LAFORGE: We aim to please. 
REGINOD: We need you. 
LAFORGE: I'm flattered. Look, fellas, I hate to repair and run, but if
you'll excuse me. One to beam aboard. 
(Grebnedlog grabs his phaser and stuns him) 
LAFORGE: Hey! Don't! 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Transporter room, beam La Forge back
immediately. 
CHIEF [OC]: Aye negative response, sir. 
RIKER: Try again! 
CHIEF [OC]: Negative response! 
DATA: The Pakled ship has a shield up, sir. 
RIKER: A shield? What kind? 
DATA: It appears to be beyond their technology. Similar to Romulan
shields. 
RIKER: Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Drop your shields. 
(They lose the viewscreen picture) 
RIKER: Status? 
WORF: Viewer transmission terminated and blocked. 
RIKER: Hail on all frequencies. 
DATA: Running frequency search. Negative, sir. 
RIKER: They're ignoring us. 
DATA: Apparently so. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
WORF: Shields up. 
RIKER: Sensors at maximum sensitivity. 
DATA: Sensors at maximum. 
WORF: Phasers ready, sir.

PICARD: Would you care for some coffee, Ensign? 
WESLEY: No, thank you, sir. 
PICARD: How about a sandwich? 
WESLEY: I don't think so, sir. 
PICARD: Oh, come on, it's been hours. You must be hungry. 
(Wesley takes a sandwich) 
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Here. (throws him a napkin) 
WESLEY: Were you ever married? 
PICARD: Never had the time. 
WESLEY: Don't you ever get lonely? 
PICARD: For ambitious Starfleet officers, there are certain costs
involved. One must be cautious of long-term commitments, Wesley. 
WESLEY: No problem. Where women are concerned, I am in complete
control. 
PICARD: Really? I always rather had to work at that. 
WESLEY: Have you always been so disciplined? 
PICARD: Good Lord, no. If I was, I wouldn't have this problem. 
WESLEY: I don't understand. 
PICARD: Well, I was a young Starfleet officer, not many years older
than you are now. Top of my Academy Class. Green as hell. And oh, so
cocky. Too cocky, as it turned out. 
WESLEY: What happened? 
PICARD: Several friends and I were on leave at Farspace Starbase
Earhart. It was little more than a galactic outpost in those days. 
WESLEY: Was this before the Klingons joined the Federation? 
PICARD: That's right. Well, my mates and I were at the Bonestell
Recreation Facility, which was something of a dead rough crossroads at
the time, filled with an assorted bunch of galactic riffraff. When a
trio of Nausicaans came in, they were clearly spoiling for a
confrontation with a group of fresh-faced Starfleet officers such as
ourselves. Well, everyone in the group had the good sense to give these
Nausicaans a wide berth, to stand off. Everyone, that is, except me. I
stood toe to toe with the worst of the three, and I told
himwhat
I thought of him, his pals, his planet, and I possibly made some
passing reference to his questionable parentage. And the next thing I
knew, all three of them were on me and I was fighting for my life. I
was actually doing quite well for a while, too. 
WESLEY: You fought them? And won? 
PICARD: I had this one Nausicaan down in this somewhat devious
joint-lock when, unbeknownst to me, one of his chums drew his weapon
and impaled me through the back. Curious sensation, actually. Not much
pain. Shock, certainly, at the sight of serrated metal sticking through
my chest. A certain giddy warmth. In fact I do actually remember that I
laughed out loud. Well, it pierced my heart, of course. Well, if we'd
not been so near to a medical facility, I would surely have died. 
WESLEY: Really? Then what happened? 
PICARD: Nothing. I was no hero, Wesley. I was an undisciplined,
loud-mouthed, opinionated young man who was way out of his league. I
learned a very hard, very painful lesson that day, but I learned it
well. I hope you never have to learn it the same way. Care for another
sandwich? 
WESLEY: Please.

RIKER: Come on, Data. 
DATA: I am programming the comm. system to scan the interference
patterns, but a full analysis will take time.
