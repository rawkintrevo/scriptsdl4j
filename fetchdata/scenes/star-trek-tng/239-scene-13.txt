[Ready room]

RIKER: Rocha's file is spotless. Two decorations
for valour, three outstanding evaluations from his previous commanders.
Doesn't sound like the same man that Lieutenant Uhnari described. 
PICARD: What did you found out about Uhnari? 
RIKER: I checked into her record, too. Her last posting was on Deriben
Five. I spoke to her commanding officer there. He said she was
argumentative, quick to take offence. He also told me he transferred
her to that relay station because she was hampering their efforts. To
be honest, I'm having trouble believing her story, sir. 
PICARD: Why? 
RIKER: I sent Worf to check the weapons locker on the relay station.
There's a phaser missing. 
PICARD: You think that she lied? 
RIKER: Lied, conveniently forgot, I'm not sure. I think it's something
we have to consider. 
PICARD: As of now, we don't have sufficient evidence one way or the
other. I want you to examine her shuttle. You might find something
there which will shed some light on her story. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

AQUIEL: How much longer do you think the
investigation will take? 
LAFORGE: Three, maybe four days. It's tough to tell. 
AQUIEL: I know I'm a suspect in the murder, but let me ask you
something. You've watched my logs. You know me better than anyone here.
Do I seem like the kind of person who could murder someone? 
LAFORGE: No, you don't. 
AQUIEL: I don't think I realised how much I needed to hear that. 
LAFORGE: Look, Aquiel, it's been a rough couple of days. I think you
need some sleep. 
AQUIEL: You called me complicated. You're right. I don't make friends
easily. Oumriel. 
(she strokes his face and goes into her quarters) 
LAFORGE: Oumriel.
