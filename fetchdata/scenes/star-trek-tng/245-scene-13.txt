(Geordi can hear the music, and goes into the main
Jefferies tube access to investigate) 
DATA: Is there a problem, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I hear music. 
DATA: Music? I do not hear anything. 
LAFORGE: Are you sure? I know I heard something. Oh, it's stopped. 
(because the musicians are kissing)

[Turbolift]

NELLA: I'd heard about Kerelian tenors all my life,
but nothing could've prepared me for this man's voice. Soaring,
incredible range. Wonderful. 
PICARD: I understand there are nuances that only Kerelians can pick up.
We just don't have the ears for it. 
(a crewwoman enters) 
NELLA: I should be finished with my survey by eleven hundred hours. 
PICARD: Very good, Commander.

WORF: Captain. The Federation Outpost on Bersallis
Three reports that they are entering a period of fire storm activity. 
LAFORGE: Bersallin fire storms happen on seven year cycle. They're not
expecting any for another eight months. 
PICARD: We don't rendezvous with the Havana for another two days.
That'll give us plenty of opportunity to study this phenomenon. 
RIKER: Helm, set course for Bersallis Three. Warp five. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Counsellor, could I speak with you in my Ready room? You have
the Bridge, Number One.
