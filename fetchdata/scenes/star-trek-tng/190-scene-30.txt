[Bridge]

PICARD: Engineering, report. 
PAVLIK [OC]: Power drain just jumped to ninety three percent, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the offspring is emitting high frequency radio
transmissions. 
RIKER: Is it trying to communicate? 
PAVLIK [OC]: The power drain is increasing, Approaching auto-shutdown. 
RIKER: Take the engines offline. Supplement with auxiliary power only.
All decks go to emergency level seven. Life support and critical
operations only. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, what is your status? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Sorry, Captain.

[Shuttlebay control booth]

LAFORGE: The bay's been completely depressurised,
but it's still hanging on.

[Bridge]

DATA: I am detecting other radio transmissions,
Captain. 
WORF: Sensors detect movement within the asteroid field. Bearing two
five seven mark one six one. 
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. 
(three adult aliens are on their way) 
DATA: At their current speed, sir, the entities will intercept us in
ten minutes, thirty one seconds. 
RIKER: Weapons status? 
WORF: Auxiliary power only. Two seconds phaser fire available.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Ensign, power readings. 
PAVLIK: We're on auxiliary generators. life support is functioning,
that's about all. 
LAFORGE: Keep your eye on that generator console. We've got less than
six minutes to get that baby off our back before his relatives get
here. Whatever we try, Junior responds by sucking up more energy. 
(Leah enters) 
LEAH: Commander, I have a thought. If you're interested. 
LAFORGE: Of course. What is it? 
LEAH: If the baby is nursing, perhaps what we need is to find a way to
sour the milk. If we could contaminate the energy he's feeding on, we
could try to 
LAFORGE: make it unpalatable somehow. But the emergency generators are
all we've got. 
LEAH: And how do we modify them without losing life support? 
LAFORGE: Exactly. Unless. 
LEAH: What? 
LAFORGE: Well. this is a space baby, right? I mean, these creatures are
born, live, and die in interstellar space. 
LEAH: Apparently. 
LAFORGE: Okay. All matter in space vibrates in a specific radiation
band. 
LEAH: Twenty one centimetres. That's good, Commander, that's very good.
If we could alter the power frequency so that it's completely foreign
to the life form's natural vibrations 
LAFORGE: It might just give us enough to pour a little vinegar in
baby's milk. 
LEAH: We have to be careful, though. If we upset it this time, we might
lose auxiliary power too. 
LAFORGE: If we're gradual enough it won't be such a shock. Hopefully
it'll just lose interest. La Forge to Bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead. 
LAFORGE: Captain, Doctor Brahms and I have a plan.
