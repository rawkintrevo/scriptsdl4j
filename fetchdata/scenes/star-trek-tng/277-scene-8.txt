PICARD JESSEL DATA LAFORGE NAKAMURA

[Crusher's office]

NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Captain. 
PICARD: Admiral. 
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: I am initiating a fleet-wide Yellow Alert.
Starfleet intelligence has picked up some alarming reports from the
Romulan Empire. It appears that at least thirty Warbirds have been
pulled from other assignments and are headed for the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Is there any explanation why they would make such a blatantly
aggressive move? 
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Our operatives on Romulus have indicated that
there appears to be something happening in the Neutral Zone,
specifically in the Devron System. Our own long range scans have picked
up some kind of spatial anomaly in the area. We can't tell what it is. 
PICARD: What are our orders? 
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: This is a very delicate situation. I am
deploying fifteen starships along our side of the Neutral Zone. I want
you to go there as well. See if you can find out what is going on in
the Devron System. 
PICARD: Am I authorised to enter the Neutral Zone? 
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Not yet. Wait and see what the Romulans do. You
can conduct long range scans, send probes if necessary, but do not
cross the border unless they do. 
PICARD: Understood. 
NAKAMURA [on monitor]: Starfleet out.

LAFORGE: Captain. What's wrong? 
PICARD: This is not my time. I don't belong here. 
LAFORGE: What? 
PICARD: I was somewhere else a few moments ago. 
LAFORGE: What do you mean? You've been right here with me. 
PICARD: No, no, no! I was somewhere else. I was, it was a long time
ago. There was someone talking. I was talking to someone. Beverly. I
was talking to Beverly. 
LAFORGE: It's okay, Captain. Everything's going to be all right. 
PICARD: I'm not senile, you know. This did happen. I was here, I was
talking to you, and then I was somewhere else. I was on the Enterprise.
I was back on the Enterprise. At least, I think that's where it was. I
was in Sickbay. Well, it might have been a hospital. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I think we should go back to the house and call your
doctor 
PICARD: Yes, yes, I know what you're thinking. It's the Irumodic
Syndrome. He's beginning to lose his mind, the old man. Well, it's not
that. And I'm not daydreaming either. 
LAFORGE: Well, all right. All right. So, what do you want do about it? 
PICARD: Data. I want to see Data. 
LAFORGE: Data? Why? 
PICARD: Because I think he can help. 
LAFORGE: Help how? 
PICARD: I don't know! I don't know! I want to see Data! 
LAFORGE: Okay, then, all right, let's go see Data. He's still at
Cambridge, isn't he? 
PICARD: Yes, I think he is. 
(six tatty humans jeering) 
PICARD: You see them, don't you? 
LAFORGE: See who? 
PICARD: They're everywhere. They're laughing at me. Why are they
laughing? 
LAFORGE: Come on, Captain. Let's go see Data. 
PICARD: Yes, Data. We'll go see Data.

(a roaring fire, plenty of cats and an obviously
fake streak of white in his hair) 
PICARD: I know how it sounds but it happened. It was real. I was there,
back on board the Enterprise. 
JESSEL: (cod English housekeeper) How do you like your tea? 
PICARD: Tea? Earl Grey. Hot. 
JESSEL: Course it's hot. What do you want in it? 
PICARD: Nothing. Well, Data, I must say, this is a fine place you have
here. They certainly treat professors pretty well at Cambridge 
DATA: Holding the Lucasian Chair does have its perquisites. This house
originally belonged to Sir Isaac Newton when he held the position. It's
become the traditional residence. 
JESSEL: Here you go. 
LAFORGE: Thank you. 
JESSEL: If you're really his friend, you'll get him to take that grey
out of his hair. Looks like a bloody skunk. 
DATA: Jessel. She can be frightfully trying at times, but she does make
me laugh. 
LAFORGE: Data, what is it with the hair anyway? 
DATA: I found that a touch of grey adds an air of distinction. 
PICARD: You say this is Earl Grey? I'd swear that it was Darjeeling. 
(Jessel leaves) 
DATA: Captain, how long has it been since you've seen a physician about
your Irumodic Syndrome? 
PICARD: A week. They've prescribed peridaxon. 
DATA: But sir, peridaxon 
PICARD: Yes, I know, it's not a cure, There's nothing that can prevent
the deterioration of the synaptic pathways. You think that I'm senile,
that all this is just a delusion. 
LAFORGE: Now come on, Captain, no one said anything of the kind. 
DATA: In all honesty, Captain, the thought has occurred to me. However,
there's nothing to disprove what you're saying. So it's possible
something is happening to you. The first thing we should do is run a
complete series of neurographic scans. We can use the equipment at the
biometrics lab here on the campus. Jessel, ask Professor Ripper to take
over my lecture for tomorrow. Possibly for the rest of the week.
Captain, we'll get to the bottom of this. 
PICARD: That's the Data that I remember. I knew I could count on you.
