JAKE: I've lost power! 
[Bridge]

RIKER: All he's got left are his manoeuvring jets,
Captain. 
LAFORGE: At this trajectory, he'll enter the atmosphere and burn up at
two hundred kilometres. 
PICARD: Probable impact? 
DATA: Atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds. 
PICARD: Options? 
WORF: Tractor beam? 
RIKER: Not possible. He's too far away for a positive lock. 
TASHA: He's out of transporter range. 
REMMICK: Captain, you are completely responsible for that boy's life. 
PICARD: Mister Remmick, either get out of my way and keep quiet, or I
will have you removed from the Bridge. Viewer on shuttle cockpit. 
TASHA: Visual on main viewer. 
PICARD: Mister Kurland. 
JAKE [on viewscreen]: I can't get the engine started. What am I going
to do? I'm going to crash. 
RIKER: He needs another fifty seconds for the core to cool down before
it can restart. 
PICARD: Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back.

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Please, help me! 
PICARD [OC]: Jake! 
JAKE: It's no use, Captain. I'm going to die out here.

[Bridge]

RIKER: He'll need another thirty seconds before he
can restart. 
DATA: Irrelevant, sir. Even if he restarts his engine now, he will not
have enough thrust to escape impact. 
PICARD: Mister Kurland, you are not going to die out there. You are
going to do exactly what I tell you. Now, take the nose of the
shuttlecraft and aim it directly at Relva Seven.

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Aim it at Relva? I can't do that. It's crazy.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do it! 
JAKE [OC]: But I'll burn up! 
DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I am
giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva!
