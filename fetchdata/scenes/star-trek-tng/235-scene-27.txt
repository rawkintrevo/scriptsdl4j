RIKER [OC]: Chief, do you have them? 
KELSO: They're here, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: Is everyone all right? 
FARALLON: We're fine, sir. But Captain Picard, Commander La Forge and
one of my men

[Bridge]

FARALLON [OC]: Are still on the station. 
RIKER: Kelso, can you get them off? 
[Transporter room]

KELSO: I'm trying, sir. I can't establish a pattern
lock. 
FARALLON: Commander we barely managed to transport off ourselves. The
field ionisation is too intense. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, the particle fountain is
continuing to surge. At the present rate, the radiation in the station
core will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes.

LAFORGE: Captain, if I can access the field
emitters, we should be able to establish a force field. See if you can
link your console to my command system sub-routine. 
PICARD: All right. Link established. 
LAFORGE: Okay, here we go. 
PICARD: I'm reading power fluctuations. The force field is not stable. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I know. The radiation levels are too high. The emitters
are beginning to deteriorate. 
PICARD: How long can we expect it to last? 
LAFORGE: Not very long. 
PICARD: We have to keep it up long enough for Commander Riker to get to
us. 
LAFORGE: Maybe we can help him out. See if you can access the emergency
shut down routine. I'll try to activate the ionic dampers.
