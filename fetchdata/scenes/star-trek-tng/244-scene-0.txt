TROI CREWMAN PICARD RIKER CREWWOMAN CRUSHER

[Corridor]

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Attention personnel on decks
fourteen and fifteen. Your transporter
room assignment has been changed. Report to transporter room three. 
TROI: Captain. We're still behind schedule on decks seven and eight.
Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll be a delay? 
PICARD: No. Open up the transporters in Cargo bay two and divert
everyone from deck seven to there. That should put it back on track. 
TROI: Right. 
CREWMAN [OC]: All beta shift Engineering personnel are requested to
report to main Engineering prior to disembarking. 
CRUSHER: Captain. Arkaria Base does not have the medical storage units
I have requested. I have seven living tissue samples that won't survive
the baryon sweep anymore than you or I would. I've tried to reason with
them, but 
PICARD: All right, all right. Have Commander LaForge transport a stasis
unit from the astrophysics lab. You should be able to convert it to
store tissue samples. 
CRUSHER: Thank you, Captain. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: All science personnel. Please check in with your
section chief for station-side duty assignments. 
RIKER: Captain. (comes out of turbolift) I was just heading for deck
seven. I've put the auto-shutdown sequence on hold until we get back on
schedule. 
PICARD: Oh, I think we can resume the sequence. Counsellor Troi is
taking care of the situation on deck seven. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.
