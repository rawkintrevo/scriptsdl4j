(Wesley is staring out of a window) 
GUINAN: Can I get you something? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. I just like to stand here. 
GUINAN: I don't blame you. It's beautiful. 
WESLEY: Yes. 
GUINAN: How about some nice Mareuvian Tea? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. Thank you. 
GUINAN: You'll be leaving soon. 
WESLEY: Yes. 
GUINAN: What do you see when you look out there? 
WESLEY: The Lorenze cluster, and there Arneb and there Epsilon Indi. 
GUINAN: That's not what I mean. I mean, when you look there, don't you
see your future? 
WESLEY: It'll still be there. 
GUINAN: How about a cup of nectar direct from Prometheus? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. That's the third time you've asked me. 
GUINAN: It's what I'm expected to do. Don't you always do what's
expected? 
WESLEY: I try. 
GUINAN: Even if it's not what you really want? 
WESLEY: Sometimes. Sometimes it's more important to consider others
before yourself. 
GUINAN: Yes. But sometimes the game is to know when to consider
yourself before others. Give yourself permission to be selfish.

LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, we have a malfunction in the containment area. 
PICARD: How serious? 
[Cargo deck five]

DEALT: Very.

Captain's log, supplemental. For reasons as yet
unknown, one of the deadly specimens of plasma plague has begun to
grow.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge.

[Cargo deck five]

LAFORGE: Captain, we've checked everything. There's
no reason for this to be happening. I can't even isolate the cause of
the problem.
