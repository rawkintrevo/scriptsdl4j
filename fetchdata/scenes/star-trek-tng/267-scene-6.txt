TAURIK: Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute? 
LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it? 
TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something. 
LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign? 
TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to
test a new warp field configuration. 
LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is
out of sync. 
TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this
configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven
percent. 
LAFORGE: You're right. 
TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at
the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything
about this. 
TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a
preliminary report when I was at the Academy. 
LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it 
TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will
become a new model for warp field operation. 
LAFORGE: Sounds interesting. 
TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if
the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. 
LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for. 
TAURIK: I was quite thorough. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation
before I authorise any tests. 
TAURIK: As you wish. 
LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't
hesitate to run them by me. 
TAURIK: As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time to
discuss them? 
LAFORGE: I'll get back to you on that. 
[Crusher's office]

OGAWA: Excuse me, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: If you're wondering about the evaluations, things couldn't be
better. 
OGAWA: Actually, I just wanted to tell you that Ensign Reilly's
condition is showing improvement. But thank you. 
CRUSHER: In fact, I'm recommending you for a promotion. How does
Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa sound? 
OGAWA: It sounds wonderful. 
CRUSHER: I'll talk to Commander Riker and I'm sure it'll be official as
soon as the current crew evaluations are over. Oh, Alyssa, how are
things going between you and Lieutenant Powell? 
OGAWA: Fine. I think. 
CRUSHER: You think? 
OGAWA: I'm sure it's nothing, but he seems preoccupied lately. Last
night he had to cancel our date. 
CRUSHER: I see. 
OGAWA: He's been putting together a research proposal. He's been really
busy with it. 
CRUSHER: I know what that's like. Sometimes I get so busy with research
I forget to eat. 
OGAWA: I just wonder. 
CRUSHER: What? Sit down. 
OGAWA: I've never met anyone like Andrew. It's as though we've known
each other forever. 
CRUSHER: You do seem very well suited. 
OGAWA: But I know that in the beginning of a romance it's possible to
be a little blind. 
CRUSHER: I'm not sure I know what you mean. 
OGAWA: Well, cancelling a date like that, the way he's been so distant
lately. Doctor, do you think those could be warning signs that he's
losing interest? 
CRUSHER: Alyssa, I think you're overreacting. 
OGAWA: Maybe so. 
CRUSHER: If I cared as much about someone as much as you care about
Andrew, he'd have to do a lot more than cancel a date before I'd get
suspicious. 
OGAWA: You're right. 
CRUSHER: I'm sure that when this research is over, things will be back
just the way they were. 
OGAWA: Except, of course, that he'll have to deal with Lieutenant
Ogawa. 
[Ten Forward]

(at the bar) 
SITO: I only filled in at Ops for a half hour, but I had to degauss the
main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal
sensors to find a lost puppy. 
WORF: Ops is a very different challenge from Tactical. 
SITO: I can't figure out why I'm even being considered for this
assignment. I'm a security officer. 
WORF: I recommended you. 
SITO: I'll try not to let you down, sir. 
(at a table) 
LAVELLE: What could they be talking about? 
TAURIK: Have you ever considered learning to lip read? 
LAVELLE: You think Worf's chewing her out? 
BEN: No, he always looks like that. 
LAVELLE: Maybe he's giving her pointers on how to land the Ops
position. 
(Riker enters) 
BEN: Hi, Will. 
RIKER: Ben. (to bartender) How you doing? 
LAVELLE: You call him Will? 
BEN: Why not? 
LAVELLE: He's second in command of this ship, that's why not. 
BEN: I'm not Starfleet, I'm a civilian. When he's in here, he wants to
be treated like a civilian. 
LAVELLE: Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform. 
BEN: You only think that because he's your CO. If you got to know him. 
LAVELLE: Right. 
TAURIK: He's convinced Commander Riker doesn't like him. 
BEN: Why? Did you crash the ship into something? 
LAVELLE: No. He just doesn't like me. 
TAURIK: He doesn't even know you. 
BEN: That's right. You should go talk to him. 
LAVELLE: About what? 
TAURIK: Perhaps something you have in common. 
BEN: He likes Jazz, poker. He's Canadian. 
LAVELLE: Yeah? My grandfather was from Canada. 
BEN: There you go. 
SITO: Hi. 
LAVELLE: Excuse me, I've got to go talk to somebody. 
(at the bar) 
LAVELLE: Good evening, sir. 
RIKER: Lavelle. Something I can do for you? 
LAVELLE: No, sir. I just came to get another drink. 
RIKER: Is there something wrong with that one? 
LAVELLE: No, actually, I, er. What are you having? 
RIKER: Trakian Ale. 
LAVELLE: Good choice. I'll have one, too. My grandfather was Canadian,
you know. 
RIKER: Really? 
LAVELLE: Aren't you one, too? 
RIKER: A grandfather? 
LAVELLE: No, Canadian, sir. Canadian. 
RIKER: No, I grew up in Alaska. 
LAVELLE: Oh. Well, they both get a lot of snow. 
RIKER: Yeah. 
LAVELLE: It was good talking to you, sir. 
(Lavelle leaves) 
BARTENDER: Your ale, Ensign.
