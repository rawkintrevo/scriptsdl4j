[Bridge]

(The much smaller Pagh turns and moves off) 
PICARD: Resume course, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Aye sir. 
PICARD: Take over, Commander Data, I'll be in observation. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. 
MENDON: Sir. I am Ensign Mendon. I just wanted to tell you how pleased
I am to be aboard the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Good to have you aboard. 
MENDON: If you have a few minutes, I've noted a few procedural items
which might speed up operations on the Bridge.
I pick things up very fast. 
PICARD: Yes, of course you do. You have an excellent record. However,
here on the Enterprise we use the chain of command. You will report
your observations to Lieutenant Worf. 
MENDON: I beg your pardon, Captain. I just wanted to impress upon you 
PICARD: No need to apologise, Ensign. We should have explained it
better to you at your indoctrination. 
(Picard leaves) 
WORF: Ensign Mendon. You may impress me. 
(Mendon doesn't look happy at the prospect)
