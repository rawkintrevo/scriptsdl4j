[Pagh Mess hall]

GUEST1: Commander, you're not eating very much. 
RIKER: I'm not that hungry. 
KLAG: Is the food all right, Commander? 
RIKER: It's delicious. The pipius claw was excellent. I also enjoyed
this Bregit lungs. 
GUEST3: And the Rokeg blood pie? 
RIKER: Delicious. 
KLAG: Good. Then you'll also enjoy this. 
RIKER: Isn't that gagh? 
KLAG: Very good. You did some research on our nutritional choices. 
RIKER: Yes, but, it's still moving. 
KLAG: Gagh is always best when served live. Would you like something
easier? 
RIKER: Easier? 
KLAG: Yes. If Klingon food is too strong for you, perhaps we could get
one of the females to breast feed you. 
(laughter all round the tables) 
RIKER: You're not worried about my weakening, are you? 
KLAG: Look around you. There are no old warriors. 
RIKER: No, sir, I'm sure they all died with honour. 
KLAG: Exactly. You may live long enough to learn about us. 
GUEST3: He is not very attractive, but I will have him. 
GUEST1: They are inquisitive. They would like to know how you would
endure. 
RIKER: Endure what? 
KLAG: Them. 
RIKER: One or both? 
(he grins, they all laugh, and the bonding has started) 
GUEST3: I may be back for you. 
RIKER: Is she serious? 
KLAG: Yes. 
(Other Klingons leave) 
KLAG: Commander, would you say you're a typical Federation officer? 
RIKER: I suppose so. Why? 
KLAG: Well, it's just you're not what I expected. 
RIKER: In what way? 
GUEST1: You have a sense of humour. 
RIKER: I was thinking the same thing about you. In all my dealings with
Klingons, including our Lieutenant Worf, the thought never occurred to
me of Klingons laughing. 
GUEST1: There is much about us you do not know. 
RIKER: That's why I'm here. 
KLAG: You should ask. 
RIKER: I may. After this tour, I may have some worthy questions. 
KLAG: Questions about what? About our future? Our future is honour. Our
present is serving this ship. 
GUEST1: Like you, I have a mother and a father. They look like me, I
look like them. 
RIKER: Are they still alive? 
GUEST1: My mother lives, My father was killed in battle at Tranome
Sar. 
RIKER: And your father? 
KLAG: My father? My father was captured in battle by Romulans and not
allowed to die. He eventually escaped. 
RIKER: Where is he now? 
KLAG: He is on our planet. He waits. 
GUEST1: He waits for his death. 
KLAG: He will eventually fade of a natural illness and die, weakened
and useless. Honourless. I will not see him. 
RIKER: He's your father. 
KLAG: A Klingon is his work, not his family. That is the way of things.

RIKER: He's your father. 
KLAG: Klingons do not express feeling the way you do. 
RIKER: Perhaps you should. 
KLAG: We would not know how. 
RIKER: Yesterday, I did not know how to eat gagh.
