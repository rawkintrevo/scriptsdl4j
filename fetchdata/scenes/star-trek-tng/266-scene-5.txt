RONIN TROI CRUSHER

[Crusher's quarters]

(Beverly is in bed reading the journal when she
dozes off. The unlit lamp flickers briefly, then her nightgown is moved
from her shoulder) 
RONIN [OC]: Beverly. 
(she starts up, awake)

[Ten Forward]

TROI: You dreamt you were in bed with someone? 
CRUSHER: Not exactly. I was in bed but there wasn't another person in
my dream. It was more like a presence. 
TROI: You said you felt a touch. 
CRUSHER: A pair of hands. They were moving across my skin. 
TROI: Like a caress? 
CRUSHER: Yes. And there was a voice, a man. He whispered my name. It
was as if I knew him, or more like he knew me. He knew exactly how I
liked to be touched. It was the most physical dream I've ever had. The
sensations were very real and extremely arousing. 
TROI: Frankly, I'm envious. 
CRUSHER: I did fall asleep reading a particularly erotic chapter in my
grandmother's journal. She wrote very detailed descriptions of her
experiences with Ronin. 
TROI: Well, that's bound to cause a dream or two. So, shall we start
going over the personnel reports? 
CRUSHER: You know, I think he had a ring on one of his hands when he
touched my shoulder, my neck. I wonder if I'll have another dream
tonight. 
TROI: I'd read two chapters.
