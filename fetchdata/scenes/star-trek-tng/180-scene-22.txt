LAFORGE: Damn! 
RIKER: Geordi, what is taking so long? 
LAFORGE: There's a lot of damage here. The myographic scanner is
operational, but the power source keeps fluctuating. 
RIKER: Can you fix it? 
LAFORGE: I can probably run a shunt from the convertor. 
RIKER: How long will that take? 
LAFORGE: Ten minutes? 
RIKER: Do it. O'Brien, lock onto Ishara and get her out of here!

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: There's a transformer substation directly
above the chamber she just entered. It's masking her signal.

[Level 3C, 547]

RIKER: Stand by. Stay here and cover La Forge. 
WORF: Commander! 
RIKER: That's an order. Return to the ship as soon as you're finished.
I'll signal for transport as soon as I can.

(Ishara is hit by weapon fire. Her assailant is
bending over her when Riker shoots him. More Alliance arrive as Riker
picks her up) 
RIKER: Get us out of here.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Energising. 
(The rest of the away team are already on board)
