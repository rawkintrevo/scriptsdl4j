PICARD RIKER SONYA LAFORGE WESLEY

[Ready room]

(Picard is packing books for his journey) 
PICARD: Come. Yes, what is it, Number One? 
RIKER: Is something wrong? This trip to Starbase Five One Five is
rather unexpected. 
PICARD: Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your return
from the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster. 
RIKER: Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic. 
PICARD: Consider it Captain's privilege. 
RIKER: As First Officer, I have complete security clearance. 
PICARD: This has nothing to do with ship's business, Number One.
Suffice it to say, it is strictly a matter of image. 
[Corridor]

LAFORGE: Relax, Wes. You'll do fine on your exams. 
SONYA: Yeah. 
WESLEY: It's not my exams I'm worried about. It's Captain Picard. 
SONYA: Why? He's not taking the exams. 
WESLEY: It's just the two of us, in a shuttlecraft for six hours. What
am I going to talk to Captain Picard about for six hours? 
SONYA: Archaeology, semantics, literature, art. You could learn a lot
from Captain Picard. 
(Picard exits the turbolift, face like thunder, arm full of books) 
LAFORGE: Ah, Captain Picard. Nice day for a little trip.
