RIKER LAFORGE CREWMAN PICARD GUINAN BORG CRUSHER DATA

[Science lab]

(with the apparatus they used when de-Borgifying
Picard) 
LAFORGE: I've been rationing his portions of energy. I think he
understands. When he cooperates, he gets fed. If not.
CRUSHER: Like a rat in a cage.
LAFORGE: Look, if I'm going to figure out his command pathways, I need
to learn how he processes information, and the only way I know to do
that is by giving him perceptual tests. And for that, I need his
cooperation.
CRUSHER: So he can participate in the destruction of his entire species.
LAFORGE: Doctor.
CRUSHER: I know, I know. We're at war. I'm here to help but I don't
have to like it.
LAFORGE: Okay, I think we're ready to transport him. If he gives us any
trouble, we can access the force field through that console. Are you
ready?
LAFORGE: La Forge to transporter room three. We're ready here.
CREWMAN [OC]: We're standing by, Commander.
LAFORGE: Energise.
(the Borg and a security man beam in. The Borg is inside the apparatus
and plugs himself into a power conduit) 
LAFORGE: Third of Five, this is Doctor Crusher. Doctor Crusher, this is
Third of Five. 
CRUSHER: Hello.
BORG: What is a doctor?
CRUSHER: A doctor heals the sick and repairs the injured.
BORG: The sick and injured are reabsorbed. Others take their place.
CRUSHER: That isn't what happen to you. When we found you, you were
dying. I saved your life.
BORG: Why?
CRUSHER: It's my duty to help those who are hurt.
BORG: You give us food.
LAFORGE: Yeah.
BORG: Is that your duty?
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's right. Listen, Third of Five, Doctor Crusher here
has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants. We want to
run a few tests, make sure everything's working okay.
BORG: Tests?
CRUSHER: I'd like to show you a few diagrams and ask you some questions
about them. It's very simple really.
BORG: You will be assimilated.
LAFORGE: Yes, but before that happens, could we ask you a few questions?
BORG: We will answer.
LAFORGE: Terrific. All right, hang on just a second here, Third of Five.
BORG: What is your designation?
LAFORGE: Designation?
BORG: Third of Five. 
CRUSHER: You mean our names. We don't have designations. We have names.
I'm Beverly. This is Geordi.
BORG: Do I have a name?
LAFORGE: Do you want one?
BORG: A name.
CRUSHER: I'm Beverly, he's Geordi, and you.
BORG: You 
CRUSHER: You 
LAFORGE: No, no, wait a minute. That's it. Hugh. What do you think?
BORG: You.
LAFORGE: No, not you. Hugh.
BORG: Hugh.
CRUSHER: Okay. Now, I'm Beverly.
LAFORGE: I'm Geordi.
BORG: We are Hugh.
(later, Hugh is out of the contraption looking at images on a wall
monitor) 
CRUSHER: Now imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned
inside out. Which one is it?
BORG: This one.
CRUSHER: That's right. He's gotten every one. Eight out of eight. That
blows the top right off the spatial-acuity percentiles.
LAFORGE: It's the prosthetic eye. It seems to be giving him very
complex visual information.
CRUSHER: Like some kind of holographic imaging system.
LAFORGE: That could be helpful. Hugh, I'd like to take a closer look at
your eyepiece. Is that okay?
BORG: Here.
(he takes the eyepiece off and hands it to Geordi)
LAFORGE: Thanks.
BORG: When you are assimilated, you will have a similar device.
CRUSHER: Hugh, do you understand we don't want to be assimilated?
BORG: Why do you resist us?
CRUSHER: Because we don't want to live the way you do.
BORG: Here it is quiet. There are no other voices.
LAFORGE: Other voices?
BORG: On a Borg ship we live with the thoughts of the others in our
minds. Thousands of voices with us always.
CRUSHER: I think what you're saying is that you're lonely.
LAFORGE: Here.
(he puts the eyepiece back on) 
BORG: When you have completed these tests, what will be done with us?
LAFORGE: We'll er, we'll send you home.
BORG: We will rejoin the Collective.

[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: You know, it's funny. When I first
creating this invasive programme I didn't have a problem with it. The
more I work with Hugh, the more I 
GUINAN: Hugh?
LAFORGE: That's what we call him.
GUINAN: You named the Borg? 
LAFORGE: Well, it was easier to have something to call him.
GUINAN: Oh, so now you have a Borg named Hugh.
LAFORGE: Right. And he's nothing like what I expected.
GUINAN: How so?
LAFORGE: I don't know. It's like he's just some kid who's far way from
home.
GUINAN: Do you know that you're the second person today to refer to
that Borg as though it were some sort of lost child.
LAFORGE: Anyway, I'm having second thoughts about what we're doing
here. I mean, programming him like some sort of walking bomb. Sending
him back to
destroy the others.
GUINAN: Let me tell you something. When that kid's big brothers come
looking for him, they're not going to stop until they find him. And
then they're going to come looking for us, and they will destroy us.
And they will not do any of the soul-searching that you are apparently
doing right now.
LAFORGE: Then why don't you go and talk to him. It might not be so
clear cut then.
GUINAN: Because I wouldn't have anything to say.
LAFORGE: Then why don't you just listen? That is what you do best,
isn't it?

[Bridge]

PICARD: What is it, Number One?
RIKER: We've picked up a vessel on the long range scanners, headed this
way.
PICARD: Analysis.
DATA: The vessel is traveling at warp seven point six. Mass two point
five million metric tons. Configuration, cubical.
RIKER: The Borg.
DATA: Its dimensions indicate that it is a scout ship similar to the
one that crashed. Interference from the star's
radiation will shield us from their sensors. We should remain
undetected until they enter the system.
PICARD: How long do we have?
DATA: At present speed they will arrive in thirty one hours seven
minutes.

[Brig]

GUINAN: You don't look so tough.
BORG: We are Borg.
GUINAN: Aren't you going to tell me you have to assimilate me?
BORG: You wish to be assimilated?
GUINAN: No, but that's what you things do, isn't it?
(a nod) 
GUINAN: Resistance is futile. 
BORG: Resistance is futile.
GUINAN: It isn't. My people resisted when the Borg came to assimilate
us. Some of us survived.
BORG: Resistance is not futile? 
GUINAN: No. But thanks to you, there are very few of us left. We're
scattered throughout the galaxy. We don't even have a home any more. 
BORG: What you are saying is that you are lonely.
GUINAN: What?
BORG: You have no others. You have no home. We are also lonely.

[Science lab]

BORG: What is Geordi doing?
LAFORGE: I'm studying the components in your prosthesis.
BORG: Why?
LAFORGE: We're trying to learn more about you.
BORG: Why?
LAFORGE: Because you're different than we are. Part of what we do is to
learn more about other species.
BORG: We assimilate species. Then we know everything about them.
LAFORGE: Yeah. I know.
BORG: Is that not easier?
LAFORGE: Maybe it is. It's just not what we do.
BORG: Why?
LAFORGE: All right, think of it this way. Every time you talk about
yourself, you use the word we. We want this, we want that. You don't
even know how to think of yourself as a single individual. You don't
say, I want this, or I am Hugh. We are all separate individuals. I am
Geordi. I choose what I want to do with my life. I make decisions for
myself. For somebody like me, losing that sense of individuality is
almost worse than dying.
BORG: When you sleep, there are no other voices in your mind?
LAFORGE: No.
BORG: Are you ever lonely?
LAFORGE: Sometimes. But that's why we have friends.
BORG: Friends?
LAFORGE: Sure. Someone you talk to, who will be with you when you're
lonely. Someone who makes you feel better.
BORG: Like Geordi and Hugh.

[Observation lounge]

(on the wall monitor, topological anomaly 4747) 
LAFORGE: That's it, Captain.
PICARD: It looks harmless enough.
LAFORGE: We had to disguise it as something innocuous. The Borg have
ways of screening out programme anomalies.
PICARD: How can a geometric form disable a computer system?
DATA: The shape is a paradox, sir. It cannot exist in real space or
time.
LAFORGE: When Hugh's imaging apparatus imprints this on his biochips,
he'll try to analyse it.
DATA: He will be unsuccessful, and will store the shape in his memory
banks. It will be shunted to a subroutine for further analysis.
LAFORGE: Then when the Borg download his memory, it'll be incorporated
it into their network, then they'll try to analyse it.
DATA: It is designed so that each approach they take will spawn an
anomalous solution. The anomalies are designed to interact with each
other, linking together to form an endless and unsolvable puzzle.
PICARD: Quite original. How long before a total systems failure?
LAFORGE: Not until the shape has gone through several hundred
computational cycles.
PICARD: When can you begin the process?
LAFORGE: About another twenty hours. Doctor Crusher wants to make sure
the new implants have taken hold.
PICARD: Very well. Begin as soon as you're ready.
(Data leaves) 
LAFORGE: Captain. I have to admit I've been having second thoughts
about this plan.
PICARD: In what way?
LAFORGE: Well, I've been getting to know him. The Borg.
PICARD: I see.
LAFORGE: He's not what I expected, Captain. He's got feelings. He's
homesick. I don't know. It just doesn't seem right using him this way.
PICARD: Centuries ago, when laboratory animals were used for
experiments, scientists would sometimes become attached to the
creatures. This would a problem if the experiment involved killing
them. I would suggest that you unattach yourself from the Borg, Mister
La Forge.
LAFORGE: Aye, Captain.
