[Police station]

(McNary sees the look on Picard's face when he sees
Crusher, and leaves without another word) 
CRUSHER: Have a good time? 
PICARD: I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say,
you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it. 
CRUSHER: Why, thank you, Mister Hill. 
PICARD: Maybe we should be getting back to the Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: We are on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, so we are. 
CRUSHER: Do we have time to see your office? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Why not. 
WHALEN: Captain, mind if I join you? 
DATA: Yeah, me too, boss. I'd love to take a gander. 
(rolled eyes all round)

[Hill's Waiting room]

PICARD [OC]: The holodeck makes excellent use of
finite space. 
(The group enter) 
LEECH: Ah, Mister Hill. You've been avoiding me. 
WHALEN: It's Felix Leech! It has to be. 
LEECH: You know me, sir? 
WHALEN: Well, I've read about you many times. 
PICARD: I'm very sorry, Mister Leech, but we have to be going. Call
again tomorrow. 
LEECH: You're being quite rude, Mister Hill. You haven't even
introduced me to your charming companions. 
PICARD: That'll have to wait. 
LEECH: But we have business! (pulls a gun) Urgent business. 
[Hill's office]

LEECH: You're not going anywhere. Not until we have
a little chat.
