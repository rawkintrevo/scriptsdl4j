PULASKI: We've stimulated random wave activity, but
the patterns are dangerously erratic. 
TROI: Hang on, Will. Hang on. 
PULASKI: The wave patterns are still too irregular. 
TROI: Why won't they stabilise? 
PULASKI: Wait. I've found the right amplitude. There. The patterns are
steadier. 
TROI: Is the stimulation preventing the infection from taking hold? 
PULASKI: For now. The vertex waves indicate a K-complex corresponding
to an REM state. 
TROI: He's dreaming.

[Encounter at Farpoint- Holodeck]

RIKER: Hello! 
(He finds Data whistling 'Pop goes the Weasel', and finishes the tune
for him) 
DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need much
practice. 
RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wants
answered. He suggested that I take you with me on the away team I'll be
leading. 
DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. 
RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. 
DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. 
RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? 
DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanics
and exobiology. 
RIKER: But your files they say you're a 
DATA: Machine? Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? 
RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. 
DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. 
RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior to
us? 
DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways. But I would gladly give it up
to be human. 
RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. 
DATA: Ah! Intriguing. 
RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data.

[The Dauphin - Ten Forward]

WESLEY: What should I say? How do I act? What do I
do? 
RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? 
GUINAN: Sounds simple enough. 
RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most important.
You may want to start with something like this here. You are the most
beautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. 
GUINAN: Yes. Yes, it would. 
RIKER: You don't know how long I've wanted to tell you that. 
GUINAN: But you were afraid. 
RIKER: Yes. 
GUINAN: Of me? 
RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. 
WESLEY: Commander? 
RIKER: Or that you might think that was a line. 
GUINAN: Maybe I do think it's a line. 
RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? 
GUINAN: I didn't say that. There's nothing wrong with a line. It's like
a knock on the door. 
RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? 
GUINAN: I'm not sending you away. 
RIKER: That's more than I expected. 
GUINAN: Is it as much as you hoped? 
RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. 
GUINAN: Dreams can be dangerous. 
RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars
and the universe worships the night. 
GUINAN: Careful. Putting me on a pedestal so high, you may not be able
to reach me. 
RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and the
soul in my night. 
WESLEY: I don't think this is my style. 
GUINAN: Shut up, kid. Tell me more about my eyes.

[The Icarus Factor - Troi's office]

RIKER: I didn't want to leave without saying
goodbye. 
TROI: I don't like goodbyes. How about, until next time. 
RIKER: How about, until next time. 
TROI: It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. 
RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. 
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but I can't read you
right now. 
RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. 
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. 
RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. 
TROI: Are you feeling sad? 
RIKER: Yes, I am. 
TROI: So am I. 
[Sickbay]

TROI: He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of warmth
and friendship. 
PULASKI: He's reliving memories. It's a natural side effect of neural
stimulation. Look at this. The organisms' metabolism has changed. I
wonder if the stimulation is affecting them somehow. I'm going to
refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex. 
TROI: To intensify his memories? 
PULASKI: Exactly. We'll see if that has an effect on the microbes. 
[Justice - Edo Council Chambers]
