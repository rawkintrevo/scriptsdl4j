[Data's quarters]

DATA: We should programme the bridge science
station to vary the emissions we direct toward the Entity. 
MARR: I'll write a subroutine that will allow us to change the
frequency of the graviton beam. Data? You told me you carried some of
my son's memories. 
DATA: That is correct, Doctor. 
MARR: What can you tell me about Renny? What were those thoughts? Was
he was he happy at all, on Omicron Theta? 
DATA: I have some vivid memories of sporting events. He played parrises
squares with a group of his schoolmates. 
MARR: Renny started parrises squares when he was young. Too young,
really. But the older children kept asking him to play, and I couldn't
keep him away. He had this natural gift. 
DATA: Yes, he was pleased to have won a championship emblem. 
MARR: I remember he wrote me about that. He was so proud. I'm
characterising pulse widths in nanoseconds. Sound right to you? 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. Your son's most intense memories revolve around a
young woman named Jenina. 
MARR: A girlfriend? I never knew about that. Of course, the last person
he would tell would be his mother. What was she like? 
DATA: He enjoyed her kindness, her gentleness, her physical attributes.

MARR: There. Now we can vary all the parameters directly from the
Bridge. 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. 
MARR: Could you do something for me? It would mean a lot. 
DATA: I would be happy to be of help. 
MARR: You see, all I have left of Renny, the only connection of him is
there, inside you. I was wondering if you would talk to me in his
voice. I know you have the ability to sound like other people, isn't
that right? 
DATA: That is true, Doctor, but what would you want me to say? 
MARR: Maybe something from his journals. 
DATA: Many of his journal entries took the form of letters to friends
and family. I could access one of those. 
DATA: (as Renny): I took my last exam today I think I did all right on
everything except cellular biology. I know you think it's important,
Mom, but I don't see how I'm ever going to use this stuff. In a couple
of weeks, a bunch of us are going on an archaeological dig in the
mountains. The Wallaces said it would be all right as long as we had
adult supervision, so don't worry. They're looking out for me. They're
really great people and I like them a lot, but they're kind of serious.
They don't have your sense of humour, Mom. Mom, I miss you.

Captain's log, stardate 45129.2. We are still in
pursuit of the Crystalline Entity. Data and Doctor Marr are prepared to
attempt communication with the being when we intercept it. I will admit
to some uncertainty about the prospect. It could
prove to be a scientific triumph, or a catastrophe.
