[Engineering]

LAFORGE: It's looking over everything, Commander,
going to school. Let's just hope it doesn't blow us to kingdom come
while it's
figuring out how to blow us to kingdom come. 
(The blue energy dives into a control panel) 
[Transporter room]

WORF: Power's back in transporter room three.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Bypassing the manual override. Shutting it
down. 
[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: Transporter is down again. 
RIKER: Keep it down, Geordi, for as long as you can. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Understood, Commander. 
[Aster home]

GUEST0: It is only a matter of time, Captain, before
we can power the transporters ourselves 
PICARD: We? For whom else do you speak? 
GUEST0: The accident on the surface was caused by a remnant of an
ancient and tragic era. Two species once shared this world. One of
energy and one of matter. The physical beings you call the Koinonians
destroyed themselves in unending, bitter wars. The surviving life forms
on this world will not tolerate any further suffering as a result of
that dishonourable past. So, they have made this possible. They have
made me possible. 
PICARD: I appreciate your motives, but his mother is dead. He must
learn to live with that. 
GUEST0: I will be every bit his mother. 
PICARD: But not his mother. Picard to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. 
PICARD: Will you escort Ensign Crusher to the Aster quarters? 
WORF [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Picard out. 
GUEST0: Your philosophy is curious, Captain. What is so noble about
sorrow? I can provide him an
existence where he will feel no pain, no anguish. 
PICARD: It is at the heart of our nature to feel pain and joy. It is an
essential part of what makes us what we are. 
GUEST0: He is alone now in your world. A child, alone. How can you know
he won't be happier with me? 
PICARD: For a brief moment in time, he surely would be. Any of us in
his place would be. 
TROI: What would Jeremy do for friends in your world? 
GUEST0: He will have any friends he needs. 
TROI: And will you provide for his education, his health, his growth, a
career, a wife? 
PICARD: Yes, it's quite an undertaking you're proposing, isn't it? 
GUEST0: It is our duty to make him happy again. 
PICARD: Do you honestly believe he would be happy in this total fiction
which you wish to create? What reason would he have to live? What
you're offering him is a memory, something to cherish, not to live in.
It is part of our life cycle that we accept the death of those we love.
Jeremy must come to terms with his grief. He must not cover it or hide
away from it. You see, we are mortal. Our time in this universe is
finite. That is one of the truths that all human must learn. 
WESLEY: Acting Ensign Crusher reporting as ordered, sir. 
PICARD: Yes. Come in, Wesley. Please stay, Lieutenant. Jeremy, Wesley's
father died on a Starfleet mission when he was younger than you are. 
TROI: Wes, your mother told me you were finding it difficult to talk to
Jeremy. Why is that? 
WESLEY: I don't know. I just didn't want to think about it any more.
All this has reminded me so much of that day. 
PICARD: The day I told you your father had been killed. As I recall,
Wesley, you took it very well. 
WESLEY: My parents taught me about the dangers of Starfleet missions. I
knew what could happen. 
PICARD: So you were prepared? 
WESLEY: No, I wasn't prepared at all. How could anyone be prepared to
hear that a parent is never coming home again? I tried to be what
everybody expected of me. Brave and mature. 
PICARD: Wesley, are you saying that you didn't want anybody to see what
you were really feeling? What were you really feeling? 
WESLEY: Like somebody had kicked me in the head. 
PICARD: Somebody? 
TROI: Go on. You've wanted to tell him for a long time. 
WESLEY: I was angry at you. 
PICARD: Why angry? Why were you angry at me, Wesley? Were you angry at
me because I was the one who told you your father was dead? 
WESLEY: No. 
PICARD: Then why? 
WESLEY: Because you led the mission. You came home and my father
didn't. 
TROI: How long were you angry with the Captain, Wes? 
WESLEY: For a long time. But not any more, sir. Not even a little. 
TROI: So, Jeremy, you must be very angry at Lieutenant Worf. He was in
charge of your mother's mission, just as Captain Picard was in command
when Wesley's father was killed. Isn't that right? Worf came back. Your
mother didn't. 
(Finally, Jeremy cries) 
JEREMY: Why? Why weren't you the one who died? Why did it have to be
her? 
TROI: He can't answer that. None of us can. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf also lost his parents. 
WORF: They were killed in battle when I was six. When I was alone,
humans helped me. Let me help you. The Marla Aster I knew and honoured
is not in this room. Nor does she await you on the planet. Now she
lives only here And here. (in their hearts) Join me in the R'uustai,
the Bonding. You will become part of my family now and for all time. We
will be brothers. 
(Marla goes up to Jeremy, then walks away. She and the house illusion
vanish. All is as it should be again)
