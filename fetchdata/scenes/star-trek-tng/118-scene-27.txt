[First Unit]

DUANA: You haven't eaten. 
WESLEY: You didn't eat anything. 
RADUE: We need very little. 
DUANA: I know you miss your family. But you will grow accustomed to us.
I promise you'll be happy. 
WESLEY: We were happy before we came. 
DUANA: We are offering more, especially for you. 
WESLEY: Duana, I feel badly for you that you have no children, but I
have to tell you that we don't want to be here and we will not
cooperate. 
[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: No. That doesn't fit the pattern. Give me
a list of the appropriate medical literature from the twenty-second
century. There's not enough time! 
PICARD: Is there anything I can do? 
CRUSHER: You just did, Jean-Luc. Now I have to get back to work.

WESLEY: Custodian's room.

[Custodian room]

WESLEY: Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher. 
CUSTODIAN: Proceed, Wesley. 
WESLEY: Show me where the Enterprise children are in relation to this
room. Thank you. Goodnight. 
CUSTODIAN: Good night, Wesley.

(Katie is startled awake by a hand on her arm) 
WESLEY: I think I know a way to get us home. I need your help.

Chief Medical Officer's log, stardate 41512.9. I've
begun to suspect that whatever is killing the Aldeans is related to a
danger faced by Earth in the twenty first century. Can it be that
Aldea's ozone layer has been weakened?
