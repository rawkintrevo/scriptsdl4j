[Holodeck]

BARCLAY: Computer, begin new programme. Create as
follows, workstation chair. (he sits in it) Now, create a standard
alphanumeric console positioned for left hand. Now an iconic display
console positioned for right hand. Tie both consoles into the
Enterprise main computer core, utilising neural-scan interface. 
COMPUTER: There is no such device on file. 
BARCLAY: No problem. Here's how you build it. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds to
critical. 
RIKER: Get us out of here. 
PICARD: Warp two, Ensign. 
ANAYA: Yes, sir. Helm's not responding. 
WORF: Captain, we have lost computer control. 
RIKER: What? 
DATA: Twelve seconds to critical. 
PICARD: Go to manual. 
ANAYA: I'm attempting that, sir 
RIKER: There's not enough time. 
WORF: Computer is coming back online, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the Argus reactors are shutting down. We are no longer
in danger, sir. 
PICARD: What happened? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. 
RIKER: Geordi, what did you do?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: It wasn't me, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut
down? 
BARCLAY [OC]: A neural interface was created to expedite the repairs. 
RIKER: Barclay? 
PICARD: Computer, respond. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I am responding, sir. I'm sorry if I caused you any
alarm. It was necessary in order to secure the Array. 
RIKER: Barclay! 
[Holodeck]

RIKER [OC]: Barclay, what's going on? Barclay! 
(blue laser lights fire at Barclay's head as he sits under his holodeck
creation) 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, Commander, it's me. 
(after a short break, Picard, Worf, Riker and La Forge have arrived on
the holodeck) 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry, Captain, I was only trying to help. Our
computer was too slow to compensate for the overload on the Array. So I
created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the
central processing unit. 
RIKER: Exactly what does that mean? 
BARCLAY [OC]: My body is as you see it here, but much of my higher
brain functions and memory have been transferred to the starboard
computer core. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. Leave
the holodeck. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm afraid I can't, sir. 
PICARD: Why not? 
BARCLAY [OC]: My primary cerebral functions are now operating almost
entirely from within the computer. They have expanded to such a degree
that it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human
brain. Any attempt to do so would mean my death.
