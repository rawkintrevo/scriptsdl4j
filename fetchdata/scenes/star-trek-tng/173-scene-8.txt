LAFORGE: Data, I was thinking about the storage
capsule last night and I was wondering, what if we've been going about
this thing the wrong way? We've been trying to analyse its mechanical
properties. What if it is a biochemical storage medium? 
DATA: Are you suggesting that it employs memory RNA like an organic
cell? 
LAFORGE: Well, it does contain quantities of nucleic acids. 
DATA: Perhaps the information sequences are encoded in the molecular
patterns themselves. 
LAFORGE: Computer, scan the storage capsule. Analyse molecular
sequences on nucleic acid chains. 
(and on the science station screen appears -) 
LAFORGE: Well. what do you know. A navigational chart. 
DATA: It appears that your hypothesis was correct, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: I knew it. Captain? 
PICARD: Found something? 
DATA: We have determined that the storage cube from John Doe's escape
pod contains navigational information. 
PICARD: Can you match these stars to our charts? 
DATA: Computer, run transformational matrix calculations. Match
navigational referents to known stars in this sector. 
COMPUTER: Information on this sector is incomplete. No correlation. 
LAFORGE: I'm not giving up yet. Not after coming so close to cracking
this thing. You know, that might be flight path information from John's
ship, but without a frame of reference, I can't determine its origin
points. 
DATA: Computer, assume those paths are course corrections and derive
gravitational values for stellar objects near those flight paths. 
DATA: Most of these are ordinary G-type stars. This would appear to be
a neutron star, possibly a pulsar. 
LAFORGE: Which means that this might be a rotational time reference. 
DATA: Computer, assume these symbols are pulsars. Translate associated
values into standard temporal notations. Computer, is there a pulsar
with a rotational period of one point five two four four seconds within
sensor range? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. 
LAFORGE: Bingo! Now, Computer, overlay navigational chart using
referenced pulsars and project a flight path back to it's origin. 
COMPUTER: Flight path originated at bearing zero zero three, mark zero
one five. Distance, two point three parsecs. 
LAFORGE: That's it, Captain. That's where John Doe came from. 
DATA: That bearing is almost directly along our planned course, sir. 
PICARD: Good. Then we can continue our mission without significant
interruption.
