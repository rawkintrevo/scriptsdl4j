(Jeremy is back to his happy memory movies) 
JEREMY [OC]: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay, you've got ten seconds
more, Mom. No peeking. Come on, Patches, in here. Shh. Okay, Mom, we're
ready. 
MARLA [on monitor]: Jeremy? I'm getting closer. Jeremy, I'm going to
find you. You must be in here somewhere. 
MARLA: Jeremy!
JEREMY: Mom?

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: All systems are functioning normally.
Still, there's this fluctuation in the containment field. I can't
account for it. 
RIKER: Data, is this possibly related to the energy fields on the
planet? 
TROI: Captain 
DATA: There is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from the
planet, sir, but I cannot pinpoint the location yet. 
TROI: Captain, there's a presence on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: An alien presence? 
DATA: No intruder noted by the sensors, sir. 
TROI: There is a presence. 
RIKER: Security, all decks yellow alert. Possible intruder. 
[Jeremy's quarters]

(Jeremy recoils from Marla's attempt to stroke his
hair) 
JEREMY: They said you were dead. 
MARLA: There was a mistake. It's okay. 
JEREMY: But there was an explosion. You were hurt. 
MARLA: I'm fine. You mustn't think any more about this. The important
thing is I'm never going to leave you again. I think somebody needs a
hug. 
(He's reluctant at first, but lets her hold him) 
MARLA: We have to go now. 
JEREMY: Where? 
MARLA: To the planet. That's where we're going to live now. 
JEREMY: We're not going to stay on the Enterprise any more? 
MARLA: No. We're going to live in a home just like we used to on Earth.
You'll see. I promise. 
(The doorbell chimes, and Jeremy answers it) 
JEREMY: Lieutenant Worf! Did they tell you? It was a mistake. She
didn't die. She's alive. 
WORF: Jeremy, come here. 
MARLA: Lieutenant Worf. It's all right. I'm here for the boy. 
WORF: Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Aster is in her quarters. 
RIKER: Repeat, Worf?
