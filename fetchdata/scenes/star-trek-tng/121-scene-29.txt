RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD LOGAN TSU DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: I am picking up energy readings. 
LAFORGE: Captain, Lieutenant La Forge here. Sensors indicate energy
readings in your area.

[Jungle]

(As Data tries to neutralise the force field,
another device arrives and starts shooting) 
PICARD: Doctor, over here! 
(Picard and Beverly run, right to the edge of a pit, where they fall
into)

[Cavern]

PICARD: Doctor. 
(Picard is unhurt, but Beverly is injured) 
[Planet Surface]

TASHA: This one is different. It's anticipating.
Data, I need you. Set your phaser on kill. I'll lead left, you get it. 
(It takes both phasers to destroy it) 
TASHA: Captain? Doctor Crusher? 
DATA: Captain Picard? (the communicator does not beep) I have a
malfunction. 
TASHA: Enterprise, this is Lieutenant Yar. Mine's out too. 
DATA: The close pass by the weapons must have disrupted our
communicators. 
TASHA: Keep on working. I'll look for the Captain and Doctor Crusher.

[Cavern]

CRUSHER: Ow! My arm. 
PICARD: How bad is it? 
CRUSHER: Oh, it's bad. 
PICARD: Come on. Alright, don't worry, we'll get you out of here.
Enterprise, this is the Captain. Two to beam up. Enterprise?
Enterprise, come in. Data? Lieutenant Yar? 
CRUSHER: What's wrong? Why aren't they working? 
PICARD: I don't know. But don't worry. As soon as they realise our
communicators are not working, the sensors will find us and Geordi will
beam us up. Now, just you hold on. I'm sorry about this. 
(He tears her jacket for a bandage) 
PICARD: Hold on, it won't be long. 
CRUSHER: I must keep conscious.

[Planet Surface]

TASHA: Data, I can't find them. 
DATA: Step back, please. I believe I have found it. 
RIKER: Data. 
DATA: All vital signs returning to normal. 
TASHA: Good. Now Geordi can get us out of here. Come on. The Captain
and Doctor Crusher can't be far away. 
[Bridge]

T'SU: Sir, I'm reading life forms on the planet.
All five members of the away team. 
LAFORGE: Good. They must have freed Commander Riker. Transporter Room,
get a lock on the away team and beam them up. 
WORF: Shields just came on. Deflectors also up. I'm picking up an
object off the port bow. It's firing! 
(Enterprise's shields light up from a green beam) 
LAFORGE: Red Alert! Battle stations! We can't the away team beam up
with our shields in place. 
WORF: Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes standing by. Locking on target.
Correction. Target has disappeared. 
LAFORGE: Give me a full scan. 
WORF: Scanning. No readings yet. Wait. Something dead astern. 
LAFORGE: Emergency power to shields! 
WORF: Object is firing. 
LAFORGE: Return fire! 
WORF: No use. It's gone again. SOLIS: Aft shields weakened. Whatever
they're using, our shields can't stand up to it much longer. 
LOGAN [OC]: This is Chief Engineer Logan. Are we breaking orbit? I need
to know now. 
Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in
command. I am unable to beam up the away team due to an unseen
assailant attacking the ship. To make matters worse, Chief Engineer
Logan is on his way to the Bridge, and he's not paying a courtesy call.
