KVADA DATA

[Klingon bridge]

K'VADA: We have more important things to attend to
than acting as your nursemaids.
DATA: Captain Picard regrets detaining you, but it will be necessary
for a while longer. In addition, I require access to your ship's
computer. 
K'VADA: Access to our computer? For what purpose?
DATA: I am going to attempt to penetrate the Romulan Central
Information net.
K'VADA: Don't bother. We've been trying for years.
DATA: I have unique skills that may allow me to succeed.
K'VADA: I cannot reveal classified Klingon entry codes to Starfleet. 
DATA: Your entry codes can be easily reconfigured after we depart. And
Captain Picard has authorised me to share with you any information we
obtain from the Romulan databanks. 
K'VADA: Anything else?
DATA: We will also need to communicate with the Enterprise in sector
two thirteen.
K'VADA: You do and the Romulans will instantly know our co-ordinates.
DATA: Using conventional means, that would be true. However, I suggest
we piggy-back our signal on Romulan subspace transmissions.
K'VADA: Piggy-back?
DATA: A human metaphor, pardon me. We would use a Romulan signal as a
carrier for own
one, thus disguising its origin.
K'VADA: It won't work.
DATA: I believe it would. During the last hour, I have conducted a
systematic review of the entire Romulan subspace grid. I have compared
my findings with the specifications of your own transmission array.
They appear to be compatible.
(K'Vada agrees) 
DATA: Thank you for your co-operation.
