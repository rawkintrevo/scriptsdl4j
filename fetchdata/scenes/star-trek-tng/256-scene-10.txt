LAFORGE [OC]: I repeat, we are under attack. 
GIUSTI: (a young woman) Commander, we've lost contact with the away
team. 
DATA: Is there a malfunction? 
GIUSTI: No, sir. The comm. system is being jammed. 
DATA: What is the source? 
GIUSTI: Somewhere on the surface. 
DATA: Bridge to Transporter room two. Can you get a lock on the away
team? 
CHIEF [OC]: Negative, sir. There's too much interference.

(what looks like a Romulan woman runs forward and
grabs the artefacts) 
RIKER: (to security woman) I'm going to head for those trees over
there. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire. 
(Riker makes it to some rocks and gets knocked out by a blast. The
mercenaries get him and beam away) 
DATA [OC]: Data to away team. Please respond. 
LAFORGE: Data, we've been attacked.

[Bridge] 
LAFORGE [OC]: We've got one casualty and Commander
Riker has been taken captive.

WORF: Sir, the mercenaries have beamed away. They
must have a base or a ship nearby. Can the sensors locate anything?
