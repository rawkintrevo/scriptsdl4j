RIKER: I'm going back for Captain Picard. Mister
Worf, assemble an Away team to accompany me to the surface. Doctor, I
need to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian. 
CRUSHER: I've just started running some tests. If I can have a few
hours. 
RIKER: I can't give the alien any more time. 
CRUSHER: Will, I haven't been able to determine if our phaser energy

RIKER: I'll take that risk. 
WORF: Sir. Permission to speak frankly. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
WORF: Our priority is to stop the aliens from any more incursions to
Earth. Any delay is unacceptable. 
RIKER: If I can save Captain Picard, I consider that very acceptable. 
WORF: The Captain would not. I recommend we target photon torpedoes on
the alien habitat and destroy it. Immediately. 
TROI: He's right, Will. 
RIKER: Power up the photons, Mister Worf. Alert me when they're ready.

(does something to his positronic net) 
LAFORGE: I don't get it. I don't understand why isn't this working.
Computer, run me a diagnostic on the input polarisers. 
COMPUTER: There is intermittent contact in the input polarisers. 
LAFORGE: Intermittent? 
(Geordi opens the back of Data's head) 
LAFORGE: What? An iron filing. How'd that get in there?
