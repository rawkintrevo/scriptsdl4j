WAITRESS RIKER TROI WORF

[Bridge]

(Worf is getting frustrated at a science station) 
RIKER: Problem? 
WORF: I have performed thirteen diagnostics of the weapons array, and I
can find nothing wrong with the guidance system. 
RIKER: I'll have Geordi run a diagnostic of the torpedo bay itself.
Maybe he can find something. 
WORF: Must you to stand so close to me? 
RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? 
WORF: Yes, I am fine. 
RIKER: No, you're not. You've been working for six hours straight.
You're tired. Take a break. 
WORF: But 
RIKER: That's an order, Lieutenant.

[Ten Forward]

(Worf is wolfing down food) 
TROI: Thanks for waiting. 
WORF: Do not approach me unannounced, especially when I'm eating. 
TROI: Worf we were supposed to have lunch together, remember? 
WORF: I was hungry. 
TROI: Well, I'm hungry too. Excuse me. 
WAITRESS: Yes? 
TROI: Can I have an order of Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order. 
WAITRESS: Certainly. 
WORF: Caviar? For lunch? 
TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger
than what you're eating. (downs a glass of water) Have you noticed how
dry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls are
set properly. 
(Worf belches) 
TROI: You're excused. 
(Troi's caviar arrives) 
TROI: Is something wrong? 
WORF: It has been a difficult day. The torpedo guidance system failed.
It was my fault. 
TROI: You always say that. 
WORF: It was my fault! I designed that guidance system. 
TROI: Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you'd like
to admit. Maybe you should get some rest. 
WORF: Perhaps you are right. If you will excuse me. 
TROI: I didn't mean right now. (and has another glass of water)
