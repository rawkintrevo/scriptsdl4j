[Corridor]

(The sound of alien music can be heard all the way
down the corridor - teenager
in residence) 
[Picard's quarters]

(Jono has rigged up a hammock near the ceiling) 
PICARD: Computer, turn off that noise! Computer, what was that? 
COMPUTER: The Alba Ra, a contemporary Talarian musical form. 
PICARD: Jono? Jono, where are you? 
JONO: You turned off my music. 
PICARD: Yes, I certainly did, and I expect it to stay turned off. Would
you come down from there? I see you've made yourself at home. 
JONO: I cannot rest on your beds. They hurt my back. 
PICARD: Would you come here. There's something I want to show you. 
(it's a slide show in a frame) 
PICARD: Those are Connor and Moira Rossa. They are your parents. The
baby is you. Jeremiah Rossa. 
JONO: My name is Jono. 
PICARD: Well, you were born Jeremiah on Galen Four. The colony was
destroyed later, during a border skirmish. 
(changes the picture to a laughing child) 
PICARD: You see? You knew how to laugh once. Do you remember any of
this, Jono? Your parents, your home? 
JONO: I know that Endar rescued me. He told me so. 
PICARD: Jono, your parents were killed by Talarians. 
JONO: It was war. Death is part of war. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, what is it, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: We've established visual contact with the warship Q'Maire. 
JONO: Endar! 
PICARD: Hey, hey! You stay put. I'm on my way, Number One. 
(Picard leaves, and Jono takes a look at some more of the pictures. He
remembers) 
CONNOR [OC]: Get to cover! 
MOIRA [OC]: I can't leave you! 
CONNOR [OC]: Take Jeremiah. Take him to the forest. I'll hold them off.

MOIRA [OC]: No! No! Come with us! Jeremiah! 
JEREMIAH [OC]: Momma!
