[Relay Station ops]

WORF: Commander, there are DNA traces here.
Klingon. 
RIKER: So Klingons did board the station? 
WORF: Yes, but I only found DNA from one Klingon so far. I will
continue to scan.

[Aquiel's quarters]

(Geordi is looking at Aquiel's novel) 
LAFORGE: How could she read this stuff? 
RIKER: How's it going? 
LAFORGE: I've managed to access all of Lieutenant Uhnari's logs. I'm
still looking for Lieutenant Rocha's. Whatever happened to the
encrypted messages had a cascade effect on the whole storage system. I
can't find his files anywhere. I'm running a level three diagnostic
now. 
RIKER: Maybe Rocha didn't make the official logs. Uhnari could have
been responsible for them. 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. Aquiel was the junior officer here. 
RIKER: Aquiel? 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Uhnari. I've been up all night watching her
personal logs. I guess I'm starting to feel like I know her. 
RIKER: What was she like? 
LAFORGE: Well she was Hahliian. She had one sister named Shiana, she
drank muskan seed punch. She had a quirky sense of humour. She liked to
sing. She had questionable taste in literature. 
PICARD [OC]: Enterprise to Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Riker here. 
PICARD: The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has arrived with Governor Torak. Please
report to the Observation lounge. 
RIKER: We're on our way.
