[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: Do you realise how many great
advancements of mankind have been tied to speed? This is a moment in
history. Right here, right now. And your names will be forever linked
with mine. 
WESLEY: Excuse me, Commander Riker. I don't think he did this. I think 
RIKER: Not now, Wes. 
PICARD [OC]: Standing by, Number One. 
WESLEY: But sir, when this all happened, I was watching his assistant 
RIKER: I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley. I am looking forward to
hearing about it. But not right now. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
KOSINSKI: (to the Traveller) Come on. 
WESLEY: He's too tired. Why don't you do it by yourself? 
KOSINSKI: Yes, why not? 
TRAVELLER: No, I will help. 
KOSINSKI: As you wish.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I've laid in the reciprocal course back,
Captain.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: Tell the captain I am ready, First
Officer. 
RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: As before

[Bridge]

PICARD: Begin at warp one point five. 
LAFORGE: Warp one point five, sir.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: This isn't working. 
(Seen only by Wesley, the Traveller vanishes and reappears again. Then
Riker notices as Enterprise head off at totally ridiculous speed down a
StarGate wormhole effect)

[Bridge]

PICARD: All stop. 
LAFORGE: Answering all stop, Captain. 
DATA: According to the instruments, sir, our speed never exceeded warp
one point five. 
LAFORGE: All stopped, sir. 
PICARD: Yes, but where is this place? 
(Lights are dancing in a blue scene) 
DATA: Where none have gone before.

Captain's log, stardate 41263.3. Instead of
returning to our own galaxy, the Enterprise has gone forward
to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our present
position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, you have the helm. I'll be in
Engineering. 
(Picard leaves) 
(There is a grunting sound, and Worf turns to see what looks like a
hairy pig with a horn and wicked looking spines) 
TASHA: What is it? 
WORF: A Klingon Targ! My pet. From home, but when I was a child. 
TASHA: You're telling me that's a kitty-cat? 
WORF: Yes, I suppose you could call it that. 
(The Targ vanishes, and a ginger cat lands on Tasha's console)
