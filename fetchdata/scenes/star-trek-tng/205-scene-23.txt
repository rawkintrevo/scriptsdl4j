locate reveal good door continues access drop message diverted

[Engineering]

(Data's head is on a shelf, laced up to a panel.
Riker is working on another one) 
RIKER: Okay, try it. 
DATA: Very good, Commander. You have established a connection. I can
now raise the door. 
(the blast door goes up to reveal Geordi's office area all lit up) 
RIKER: There's no power on this entire deck, yet somehow these monitors
are working. 
DATA: The power reaching those monitors has been diverted from the
Bridge, sir. 
RIKER: But why? Unless there's something they want us (pause) something
they need us to see. Wait a minute. Data, the containment field
strength is down to eighteen percent. Can you stabilise it? 
DATA: No, sir. I do not have access to the containment field. You will
have to establish a new link. Locate the ODN conduit, sir. 
(Riker probes Data's exposed circuits) 
RIKER: Got it. 
DATA: Yes, sir. You must now change the input matrix in my secondary
optical port and then connect the ODN conduit. 
(his right eye closes) 
DATA: That is not the correct port, sir. 
RIKER: Sorry. 
DATA: You must hurry, Commander. The containment field has dropped to
sixteen percent. 
RIKER: I'm trying. You need a bigger head. 
DATA: The field continues to drop, sir. Collapse is imminent. 
RIKER: Try it now. 
DATA: I have a connection, sir. I am now stabilising the containment
field. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: Sir, the field strength is stabilising.
Eighteen percent, twenty, twenty five. 
RO: I guess they got our message. I was wrong, Counsellor. 
TROI: You could have easily been right.
