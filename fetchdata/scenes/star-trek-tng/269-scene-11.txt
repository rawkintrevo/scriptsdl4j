[Data's quarters]

(a dirt floor and a raised hearth in the middle) 
PICARD: Hello. 
DATA-ELDER: Difficult to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not for an
old man. 
PICARD: Tell me about Masaka. 
DATA-ELDER: My daughter. 
PICARD: Tell me, how can I talk to her? 
DATA-ELDER: Children grow, forget their parents. Only Korgano can talk
to Masaka. 
PICARD: Korgano? Who is that? 
(the fire flares) 
DATA-IHAT: Well, aren't we the persistent one. 
PICARD: Ihat. 
DATA-IHAT: Is anyone else so charming? 
PICARD: Masaka is taking over my ship. 
DATA-IHAT: I told you she would. 
PICARD: I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is the
only one who can do that. 
DATA-IHAT: Who told you that? 
PICARD: An old man. Masaka's father. 
DATA-IHAT: Oh, yes, yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his
bones to make the world. Any wonder he doesn't like to talk about her? 
PICARD: How can I find Korgano? 
DATA-IHAT: I don't know. He's not chasing her anymore. 
PICARD: Where has he gone? 
DATA-IHAT: Stop asking me these questions. I was fast enough to get
away from her once. I don't want her to find me again. I'll wind up on
her sacrificial slab. 
PICARD: Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me.
Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you. 
DATA-IHAT: Well, there's an idea. Better you than me. 
PICARD: Very well. What do we do. 
DATA-IHAT: You must build Masaka's temple. The Queen's temple. That
will get her attention. 
PICARD: Very well. How do I do that? 
DATA-IHAT: You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old
man. But just try getting it out of him. 
PICARD: Give me the sign. 
DATA-IHAT: If she finds out, you can't imagine her rage. She lets
people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive.
She is glorious. 
PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me. 
DATA-IHAT: If she comes, you will take my place? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA-IHAT: All right. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the
unending horizon. A curve as. She has found me. 
PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. 
DATA-IHAT: It seems I was not fast enough. 
DATA-ELDER: So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't
remember anymore. 
PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka's
temple. 
DATA-ELDER: It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he
can stop her. 
(Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the dirt) 
PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as the
unending horizon. A curve 
DATA-ELDER: As the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray
as the rising sun. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
DATA-ELDER: Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire. 
DATA-BOY: I'm alone. No one left to help me. She's coming. 
PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? 
DATA-BOY: No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die. 
(Data no longer has the symbols on him)
