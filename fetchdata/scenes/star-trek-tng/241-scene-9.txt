PICARD: Good morning. 
MARTA: Johnny. 
PICARD: What's wrong? 
MARTA: Well, this is the morning after, huh? 
PICARD: Look, I don't regret anything that happened last night. I hope
you don't either. 
MARTA: I don't know. We've been friends for a long time and, and now
I'm afraid we've ruined that friendship. 
PICARD: Then perhaps we should forget about what happened and try to 
MARTA: I wish I could. It would make it much easier to say goodbye
tomorrow. We're all supposed to get together later for our last big
night before we ship out. 
PICARD: I don't want you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. 
MARTA: We've planned it. I'll be there. 
(Marta leaves, her breakfast on the table) 
Q: Well, let's see. You've managed to get slapped by one woman, a drink

PICARD: I think you'll like serving on board the
Ajax. I hear that Captain Narth is an excellent officer. 
COREY: So I hear. 
PICARD: Well, here's to the class of 'twenty seven. 
(three Nausicaans enter) 
NAUSICAAN: Play dom-jot, human. Give you a better chance. Give you a
bigger stick maybe. 
PICARD: I don't think we're interested. 
NAUSICAAN 1: They are undari. Cowards. 
COREY: What did you say? 
NAUSICAAN: Coward. Like all Starfleet you talk and you talk, but you
have no guramba. 
COREY: Why don't we find out. 
PICARD: Don't be a fool, Corey. Look, there are plenty of other people
to play dom-jot with. Now just go about your business. 
NAUSICAAN: Maybe I play with her. Give her good time. 
(Corey is about to hit the Nausicaan when Picard pushes him over) 
NAUSICAAN: Orcho lok resnik. Starfleet. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon. 
COREY: I don't know who you are any more, but you're not my friend. 
MARTA: Goodbye, Johnny. 
(Corey and Marta leave) 
Q: Congratulations, mon capitaine. You did it. 
WORF [OC]: Can I help you?
