JONO: She used to sing to me. I don't remember the
melody, just the sound of her voice. Before I remembered these things,
I was strong. And now 
PICARD: It's part of being human, Jono. But, as deeply as you can feel
hurt, you can also feel joy. 
JONO: I do not think so. I think I will always feel like this. 
[Ten Forward]

(Riker and Wesley are at a table, eating. Data is
playing chess) 
RIKER: How was the racquetball? 
PICARD: Oh, he gave me quite a game for his first time out. 
JONO: Yes, Captain. I'm looking forward to next time. 
PICARD: I'm sure you are. Sit down. What would you like? 
JONO: What is that? 
WESLEY: This is called a banana split. It's quite possibly one of the
greatest things in the universe. Here, try some. 
DATA: That is called a spoon. 
(Jono stabs the dessert through the heart with the spoon. Cream goes
all over Wesley) 
JONO: Forgive me. 
(Everyone is laughing, including Jono) 
DATA: I fail to understand why this is amusing. 
RIKER: Access your data banks under humour, subheading slapstick. 
DATA: Comedy stressing farce and horseplay. Ah. This, no doubt, is a
variation on pie in the face? 
RIKER: Now do you see why it's funny? 
DATA: No, sir, but I will take your word for it. It is very amusing. 
WESLEY: Let's try this again. I'd like a fresh banana split, and
another one for my friend here. 
WAITER: Right away. 
(Picard and Riker go to the bar) 
PICARD: Look at him. He's a different person. 
RIKER: Who would have thought we'd see him laugh out loud like that? 
PICARD: Just half an hour ago he was crying like a baby.
