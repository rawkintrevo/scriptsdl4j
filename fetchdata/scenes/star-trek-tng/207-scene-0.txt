PICARD SPOCK
easily achieved ll question sarek sir ambassador news discuss

 [Romulan caves]

SPOCK: What are you doing on Romulus? 
PICARD: That was to have been my question of you, sir. 
SPOCK: It is no concern of Starfleet. 
PICARD: On the contrary, it is very much Starfleet's concern. You're in
a position to compromise the security of the Federation. 
SPOCK: You may assure your superiors, Captain, that I am here on a
personal mission of peace, and I will advise Starfleet when it is
appropriate. 
PICARD: That is not satisfactory. 
SPOCK: You cannot remain here, Captain Picard.
PICARD: And I will not return without a full explanation. Ambassador,
with great respect for all that you've achieved on behalf of the
Federation, this sort of cowboy diplomacy will not easily be tolerated
any more. 
SPOCK: Cowboy diplomacy? 
PICARD: If you wish to undertake a mission with obvious repercussions
to the Federation, then you should discuss it with the Federation. I'm
here as their representative. You'll have to discuss it with me.
SPOCK: That is precisely what I had hoped to avoid.
PICARD: I also have the responsibility of being the bearer of unhappy
news.
SPOCK: Sarek? Sarek is dead? Walk with me, Picard.
