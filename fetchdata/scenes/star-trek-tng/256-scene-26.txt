RIKER DATA TROI WORF BARAN

[Mercenary Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Drop your shields and prepare to be
boarded. 
BARAN: You sent them a message. You told them where to find us. 
RIKER: That's ridiculous. When did I have a chance? 
BARAN: This is set to kill. Order your ship to disengage. Activate
visual.

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander. Are you all right?

[Mercenary Bridge]

BARAN: Tell him! 
RIKER: Mister Data, withdraw the Enterprise. That's an order. 
[Bridge]

DATA: That is impossible, sir. The ship you are on
has violated a Federation outpost. It is my duty to stop it. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: I'm your commanding officer. I'm giving you a
direct order. Understood? 
DATA: Commander, if you could explain 
[Mercenary Bridge]

RIKER: I've never explained my orders before. I'm
not about to start now. 
(ends transmission) 
RIKER: I won't let him blow this ship into space. If I can set up a low
level comm. link between the two ships, I can use my personal command
codes. I can deactivate the shields. 
BARAN: Do it.

[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, we are receiving some kind of
signal from the mercenary ship. These are Commander Riker's access
codes. He is attempting to shut down our shields. 
TROI: That doesn't make any sense. He knows those codes would have been
changed as soon as he was captured. 
DATA: That is correct, Counsellor. He does know. Mister Worf, prepare
to drop the shields. 
WORF: Sir, we would be totally defenceless. 
DATA: I am aware of that. 
WORF: Sir, as soon as they see 
DATA: Mister Worf, that is an order. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
