[Interrogation room]

(Picard enters to a packed house) 
PICARD: You've opened the hearing to spectators? 
SATIE: It isn't good to have closed door proceedings for too long. It
invites rumour and speculation. 
PICARD: Nevertheless, Admiral, I think it would be wise 
SATIE: Because spies and saboteurs don't like the bright light of an
open inquiry. They're like roaches, scurrying for the dark corner. 
PICARD: This hearing is convened on Stardate 44780 as a continuing
inquiry into the activities of Crewman Simon Tarses. Mister Tarses, for
your own protection, I have assigned a counsel to you in the person of
Commander William Riker. 
GUEST0: Thank you, sir, but I don't need protection. I have not done
anything wrong. 
SATIE: Doctor Crusher, have you observed Crewman Tarses with J'Dan? 
CRUSHER: Well, yes, he gave him his injection. 
SATIE: I meant outside of Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: I think so, perhaps in Ten Forward. 
SATIE: And whom else have you observed at these occasions? 
CRUSHER: I don't understand what relevance that has. It was an innocent
social gathering. 
SATIE: If it was so innocent, why do you hesitate to give us the names?

PICARD: Thank you, Doctor. (sotto) If you have a case to make against
Tarses, you had better make it, otherwise I'm stopping this here and
now. 
GUEST2: Mister Tarses. Isn't it true that you have access to the
biological supplies in Sickbay? 
GUEST0: It's part of my job, yes. 
GUEST2: J'Dan used suspensions of deoxyribose to carry the encoded files
he stole. Isn't it true one of your duties is to prepare those
suspensions? 
GUEST0: Several technicians share that job. 
GUEST2: And isn't it true that your security clearance allows you access
to all the stores and files in Sickbay? Access which you can exercise
at any time? 
GUEST0: Because I have access does not mean I 
GUEST2: What would you say if I told you there is evidence that the
explosion in the engine room was caused by a corrosive
chemical. One that is kept stored in Sickbay. 
GUEST0: I had nothing to do with that. 
GUEST2: How can we believe you? How can we believe someone whom we know,
we know, to be a liar? 
RIKER: I object! There is no basis for calling Crewman Tarses a liar. 
PICARD: Agreed. Mister Sabin. 
GUEST2: Captain, there is a basis which will become clear in a moment.
Mister Tarses, didn't you deliberately and
premeditatively lied when you filled out your personnel application and
compounded that lie by repeating it to this committee? 
GUEST0: What? 
GUEST2: Isn't it true that the paternal grandfather of whom you speak
was not a Vulcan but was in fact a Romulan? That it is
Romulan blood you carry and a Romulan heritage that you honour? 
(Riker whispers in Simon's ear) 
GUEST2: We're waiting, Mister Tarses. 
GUEST0: On the advice of my counsel I refuse to answer that question,
in that the answer may serve to incriminate me.
