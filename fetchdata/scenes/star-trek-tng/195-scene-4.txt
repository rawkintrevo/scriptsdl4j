PICARD SATIE WORF JDAN

[Turbolift]

J'DAN: On the Klingon Home World your name is not
mentioned. It is as though you never existed. A terrible burden for a
warrior to bear, to become nothing, to be without honour, without the
chance for glory. 
[Corridor]

J'DAN: I have friends, powerful friends, on the
homeworld. I could talk to them. They might help to restore your name,
if you could just take me to a shuttlecraft.

[J'Dan's quarters]

J'DAN: It could be done without any one knowing
about it. 
(Worf hits J'Dan) 
WORF: I don't know how you transferred secret information to the
Romulans, but I will find out. 
J'DAN: Pahtk! 
WORF: When we inform the Klingon High Council, they will put you to a
slow death.

Captain's log, supplemental. Retired Admiral Norah
Satie, whose investigation exposed the alien conspiracy against
Starfleet Command three years ago, is
arriving to assist in our inquiry.

[Transporter room]

SATIE: Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Admiral Satie. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. 
SATIE: Delighted to be here. I managed to acquire my former staff. My
aide, Sabin Genestra, from Betazed, and my assistant, Nellen Tore, from
Delb Two. 
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I show
you to your quarters? 
SATIE: Captain, if Starfleet Command is so concerned with your report
they brought me out of retirement, I think I should get right to work. 
PICARD: Very well. Commander Riker, will you see to the Admiral's
staff? 
SATIE: First, I'd like to inspect the damage to your engine room.
