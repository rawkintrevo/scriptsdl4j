[Transporter room]

(Barclay and Crusher enter. She sets up some
equipment) 
O'BRIEN: After fifteen seconds or so in the beam, you may start to feel
light-headed. Try to stay calm. Oh, and it's important not to move
around too much. 
BARCLAY: Right. 
O'BRIEN: Initialising the back-up pattern buffer. Holding at stand by. 
LAFORGE: Ready, Reg? 
BARCLAY: Energise. 
O'BRIEN: Molecular resolution at sixty percent. Engaging static mode.
His pattern is locked and holding. 
LAFORGE: Starting biofilter scan. 
(Barclay sees a maggot in the matter stream) 
O'BRIEN: Signal's holding. 
CRUSHER: The imaging scanners still haven't isolated the microbes. 
O'BRIEN: I'll try increasing molecular dispersion. 
LAFORGE: His signal resolution's dropped to fifty five percent. 
O'BRIEN: Don't worry. I can hold him together. 
(the huge 'microbe' is eye to eye with Barclay) 
O'BRIEN: Commander, the signal resolution's down to fifty percent. We
need to bring him back. 
LAFORGE: I know, I know. Just give me one more second. We need more
dispersion. Increase phase transition frequency 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
CRUSHER: The imaging scanners are actuating. 
LAFORGE: Got it. Pattern acquisition Positive. 
O'BRIEN: Programming biofilter. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry, Reg. This won't hurt a bit. 
(now there are three 'microbes' with Barclay. He grabs the first one
and clutches it to his chest) 
O'BRIEN: I'm reading a ninety two percent increase in mass! 
LAFORGE: There's something in the beam with him. Security to
Transporter room three. 
WORF [OC]: Right away. 
O'BRIEN: I'm setting up a force field round the chamber. 
(Barclay is materialised with his back to them, holding another person.
They both fall to the floor) 
CRUSHER: Drop the force field. 
(Worf and two security personnel enter) 
BARCLAY: There are more crew members in the beam. You have to grab them
and hold on. 
WORF: Understood. Follow me. 
LAFORGE: Reg, what happened? 
BARCLAY: Well, when I saw there was more than one of them, I thought
maybe the other crew was trying the same thing that we were. 
CREWMAN: We're infected with something. Lieutenant Kelly tried to
reprogram the biofilter 
LAFORGE: It looks like he pushed molecular dispersion past the
integrity point. Your patterns got caught in the beam. 
BARCLAY: The residual energy from the plasma streamer. It must've
amplified the charge in the buffer enough to keep your patterns from
degrading. 
(Worf and the security team are beamed back with three more Yosemite
crewmembers) 
Captain's log, stardate 46043.6. The reprogrammed
biofilter was effective in removing the alien microbes from Mister
Barclay and the four crewmembers. The microbes have been returned to
the plasma streamer.
