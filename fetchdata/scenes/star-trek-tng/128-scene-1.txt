PICARD TROI RIKER WORF

  [Bridge]

TROI: You're worried. 
PICARD: With reason. 
TROI: About Worf or Commander Riker? 
PICARD: Both. I think it is perhaps best to be ignorant of certain
elements of Klingon psyche.

[Holodeck]

(A jungle, with ruins. Riker and Worf are unarmed
and moving very cautiously. Worf goes ahead to find his armoured
gauntlet) 
RIKER: Above, look out! 
(An alien with a metal mace attacks. Riker goes to help and knocks it
out with a metal tube. Meanwhile a second 'monster' with an axe is
giving Worf a run for his money. When it is finally defeated, Worf is
so fired up he comes after Riker too)
RIKER: The exercise is over! 
(Work raises the axe to strike Riker) 
RIKER: At ease, Lieutenant! 
(That stops him) 
RIKER: Exit Holodeck. You do this every day? 
WORF: No, Commander. Usually my calisthenics are more intense, but
those sessions are too personal to be shared. 
RIKER: I'll bet they are. 
WORF: Computer. Programme complete. Save. Coming Commander? 
RIKER: Right behind you.

reach toward the Morgana Quadrant, a section of the galaxy which has
yet to be visited by a manned Federation vessel. We are using the time
to further detail the charts of this region.
