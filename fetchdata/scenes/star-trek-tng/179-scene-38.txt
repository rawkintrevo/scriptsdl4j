[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Fifteen metres per second. We're going to
lose it in about four minutes. 
TRAVELLER: It is time, Wesley. 
(eyes closed, Wesley enters commands on the big table) 
LAFORGE: We're ready, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: Proceed. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I'll be in Engineering.

[Engineering]

TRAVELLER: Let it go, Wesley. Let go of the
anticipation, the expectations, the demands upon yourself. Let it all
go. Leave it behind. Yes. The ability is there inside of you. You do
not need to look for it. 
[Bridge]

COMPUTER: Three minutes thirty seconds to life
support failure. 
CRUSHER: The Traveller used his thoughts to alter warp fields. Thoughts
became reality. Now I'm in a warp field. Could my thoughts have changed
this reality? Come on, Beverly! What's the next step? What was I
thinking at the moment Wesley's bubble formed? Dalen Quaice. He said
all the people he'd known were gone. I thought of Jack, I went to see
Wesley, the flash in Engineering. That's when it started. That's when I
started losing everybody. My thoughts created this universe. Can they
get me out of it again? 
COMPUTER: That information is not available. 
CRUSHER: I'm not talking to you. Click my heels together three times
and I'm back in Kansas. Can it be that simple? 
(Picard arrives in Engineering to watch the Traveller do his phasing
thing) 
COMPUTER: Two minutes, thirty seconds to life support failure. 
CRUSHER: Computer, hypothetical situation. A person is trapped inside
of a static warp bubble. Determine a means of escape.

COMPUTER: Escape would theoretically depend on establishing a stable
threshold between the warp field and the outer environment. 
CRUSHER: Describe this threshold. 
COMPUTER: Negative. There are no known practical applications of this
theory. 
CRUSHER: Extrapolate from theoretical database. How would it manifest
itself? 
COMPUTER: A dynamic atmospheric disturbance of great intensity. 
CRUSHER: Disturbance? The vortex. They must have been trying to reach
me! But how do I find it? Wesley, where do I go? Help me. 
CRUSHER: Stable threshold. They've been trying to create a stable
threshold. Where are they trying to do it? Where did they do it the
first time? Engineering! 
COMPUTER: One minute, thirty seconds to life support failure.

[Turbolift]

CRUSHER: Engineering. 
COMPUTER: Failure in turboshaft four. Unable to proceed to main
Engineering. 
CRUSHER: Just take me anywhere on deck thirty six!
