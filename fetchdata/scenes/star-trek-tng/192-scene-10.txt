CRUSHER: The parameters are pretty broad, Data. Any
match we make is going to be inconclusive at best. 
DATA: I am aware of that, Doctor. However, I can see no other
reasonable course of investigation available to us. And we may not have
much time. 
CRUSHER: You're worried about Geordi, aren't you? 
DATA: I am an android. It is not possible 
CRUSHER: for you to feel anxiety. 
DATA: Starfleet personnel have vanished. Others may be at risk. We must
do the best we can to find out why. However, I am strongly motivated to
solve this mystery.

(Geordi is watching the sensor log, and Susanna is
increasingly jumpy) 
LAFORGE: Freeze visuals. 
SUSANNA: We're wasting our time. 
LAFORGE: That's not how you felt before. It was your idea to look for
some sort of commonality. 
SUSANNA: Yeah, well, I was wrong. We're not going to find anything this
way. We should go back to the planet. It's all down
there. Everything we need to know. 
LAFORGE: That's just not an option. At least, not until Captain Picard
says it is. Computer, resume. 
SUSANNA: I can't look at that anymore. It hurts my eyes. I can't think.
My brain feels like it's wrapped up in a blanket. 
LAFORGE: Take a break, all right? I'll work on this. 
SUSANNA: I don't need a break. I need to get off the ship. 
LAFORGE: Susanna, why don't we go and see Doctor Crusher? 
SUSANNA: Forget Crusher and forget your logs. Tarchannen's down there,
Geordi. It's waiting for us. That's where we should go. 
LAFORGE: Susanna, you can't leave. Susanna. Susanna! 
SUSANNA: Geordi! 
(She has a sort of fit and falls to the floor. There are strange veins
showing on the back of her neck and the three middle fingers of each hand are fusing
together)
