DATA: Ishara is willing to have the implant
removed, sir. 
PICARD: Good. Inform Doctor Crusher. 
DATA: She also expressed a desire to leave the colony. She hopes to
apply to the Academy and eventually join Starfleet. 
PICARD: Does she understand the magnitude of these decisions? 
DATA: She claims to, Captain. 
TROI: I get a sense of ambiguity from her. Her loyalties are clearly
divided, Captain. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting we deny her an escape from this environment?

TROI: No, I'm just not sure she wants to escape. It's the only way of
life she's ever known. 
PICARD: Ultimately, it is her decision to make, not ours. Mister Data,
proceed with the mission as planned. 
TROI: Data? 
DATA: Yes, Counsellor? 
TROI: You seem so strong in your support. I'm curious. 
DATA: We must free the crewmen. She appears to be our best hope of
doing so. In addition, I have become used to her.

DATA: Ishara. 
ISHARA: Thank you, Data. 
DATA: You are welcome. Doctor Crusher is expecting you in Sickbay. 
ISHARA: It's all so different. 
DATA: To what are you referring? 
ISHARA: On the colony, nobody does anything for anyone else unless they
have something to gain from it. 
DATA: But I do have something to gain from it. Your continued presence
on this ship. Is something wrong? 
ISHARA: I have to tell Hayne and the others. I owe it to them. Guess I
ought to get it over with. 
DATA: If you desire privacy, you may use the Observation lounge. 
ISHARA: That would probably make things a little easier. 
(she gives Data a little kiss on the cheek) 

[Observation lounge]

HAYNE [on monitor]: Report. 
ISHARA: It's working.

Captain's log, stardate 44225.3. Doctor Crusher has
successfully removed Ishara's magnetic implant, enabling the young
woman to guide
our rescue attempt. Without my intending it, she has virtually become
an active member of the crew.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Cardiovascular functions normal.
Metabolism, immunity, all other vital signs excellent. How do you feel?

ISHARA: Better than I've ever felt. (to Data) Thanks for staying with
me. 
CRUSHER: You might want to keep this. It's been with you a long time. 
(Beverly hands her the implant, and leaves.) 
ISHARA: You keep it, Data, so you won't forget me. 
DATA: Have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us? 
ISHARA: No. Just in case something goes wrong down there.

[Corridor]

WORF: I understand you wish to join Starfleet. 
ISHARA: Some day. If I'm lucky. 
WORF: On that day, it is we who will be lucky.

[Transporter room]

(Worf and Ishara enter) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? 
RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir.
