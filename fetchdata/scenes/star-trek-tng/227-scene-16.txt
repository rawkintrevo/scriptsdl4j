CLEMENS TROI LAFORGE

[Turbolift]

CLEMENS: That's what the Spanish said. 
TROI: Deck thirty six. 
CLEMENS: And the Dutch and the Portuguese. It's what all conquerors
say. I'm sure that's what you told that blue-skinned fellow I just saw,
before you brought him here to serve you. 
TROI: He's one of the thousands of species that we've encountered. We
live in a peaceful Federation with most of them. The people you see are
here by choice. 
CLEMENS: So there're a privileged few who serve on these ships, living
in luxury and wanting for nothing. But what about everyone else? What
about the poor? You ignore them. 
TROI: Poverty was eliminated on Earth a long time ago, and a lot of
other things disappeared with it. Hopelessness, despair, cruelty. 
CLEMENS: Young lady, I come from a time when men achieve power and
wealth by standing on the backs of the poor, where prejudice and
intolerance are commonplace and power is an end unto itself. And you're
telling me that isn't how it is anymore? 
TROI: That's right. 
CLEMENS: Well, maybe it's worth giving up cigars for after all.

[Science lab]

(the one where Lal was born and Picard
de-Borgified) 
TROI: Any luck? 
LAFORGE: Not so far. His activating units won't initialise. I thought
they would have been protected by his buffering
programme, but I guess five hundred years is just too long a wait. 
CLEMENS: My watch. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. It was found in the cavern where Data's head was. I
guess after five hundred years, that's not likely to work either. 
CLEMENS: Mister Data, I fear I sadly misjudged you. As I have misjudged
many things.
