pulp while Picard flickers) 
[Bridge]

WORF: The Tamarian and the entity are in close
proximity. The Tamarian's lifesigns are fluctuating. 
RIKER: The scattering field is still in full force. What the hell is
wrong with them? Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ours
can. Riker to O'Brien. Report.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: The field's still deflecting the signal.
There just isn't enough of him, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Open a channel to the Tamarian ship. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Your captain is under attack. Drop your particle field. 
TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Kailash. When it rises. 
WORF: They have closed the channel. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to Bridge.

Dathon) 
DATHON: Shaka. 
PICARD: when the walls fell.

First Officer's log, stardate 45048.8. Our attempt
to transport Captain Picard back to the ship has failed. My options are
narrowing and my patience is all but gone.
