DATA: Can you override? 
COMPUTER: Negative. 
DATA: Show me the shortest route to Transporter room one. Computer,
prepare to activate cascade force field sequence in the following
progression.

LAFORGE: No matter what we try, the computer will
only accept commands from the Bridge, sir. 
WORF: He has blocked every subspace channel, sir. We cannot even call
for help. 
PICARD: Have you tried tracing back navigation inputs? 
WESLEY: We don't even know what star system we're in, sir. 
RIKER: The only way we knew we'd come out of warp was by looking out a

PICARD: Mister Worf, I want security teams along the main passageways
and in every transporter
room. And see if the computer would be good enough to give you the
