[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Go ahead, Commander. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Confirm phase sequencer linkage. 
O'BRIEN: Link confirmed. Ready whenever you are, sir.

[Planet surface]

DATHON: (pushing Picard back) Uzani, his army at
Lashmir. 
PICARD: At Lashmir? Was it like this at Lashmir? A similar situation to
the one we're facing here? 
DATHON: Uzani. His army with fist open. 
PICARD: A strategy, with fist open. With fist open. 
DATHON: His army, with fist closed. 
PICARD: With fist closed. An army with fist open to lure the enemy.
With fist closed to attack? That's how you communicate, isn't it? By
citing example. By metaphor. Uzani's army with fist open. 
(and Picard opens the distance between them) 
DATHON: Sokath. His eyes uncovered! 
(Picard gets a stab at the creature, but he gets a jolt through the
dagger and drops it. Dathon then attacks, Picard rejoins and is thrown
down again. Dathon takes the full brunt of the creature's fury and
Picard gets beamed away) 
PICARD: No! 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I've got a piece of him, Commander, but
that's all.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Boost the confinement beam.

[Engineering]

LEFLER: One fifty seven over standard. 
LAFORGE: It's as solid as it'll go, Commander.

(Dathon is being thrown around and battered to a
pulp while Picard flickers) 
[Bridge]

WORF: The Tamarian and the entity are in close
proximity. The Tamarian's lifesigns are fluctuating. 
RIKER: The scattering field is still in full force. What the hell is
wrong with them? Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ours
can. Riker to O'Brien. Report.
