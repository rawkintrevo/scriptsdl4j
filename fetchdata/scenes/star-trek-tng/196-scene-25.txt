(Timicin is sitting gazing at the stars) 
LWAXANA: I'm so sorry, Timicin. I had one of those named after me once.
Brilliant young astronomer from Rigel Four. Of course, I sparkled a bit
myself in those days. You see, that's called fishing for a compliment.
You're supposed to tell me I still sparkle. I'm sorry, I'm not helping,
am I? 
TIMICIN: You're very kind. I'm just not adequate company right now. 
LWAXANA: Oh, that's all right, I can make enough conversation for both
of us. I'll leave you alone. 
TIMICIN: No. Please stay. I wanted to tell you how much I wish we had
met years ago. 
LWAXANA: What difference do a few years make? 
TIMICIN: Unfortunately, a great deal. You see, Lwaxana, I'm on my way
home now to die. 
Captain's log, stardate 44812.6. We have returned
