[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: Leave no evidence that we were ever
here. 
PICARD: Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Thank you, Captain. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, notify Security to prepare a detention cell.
Bridge to Engineering.
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need to
neutralise the homing signal 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Prevent it from sending or receiving
transmissions of any kind.
LAFORGE: I'll set up a subspace damping field around the detention
cell. 
PICARD [OC]: Very well. 
[Crash site]

WORF: Four more. None survived.
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker.
RIKER: Go ahead, Enterprise.

[Bridge]

PICARD: We are transporting you directly to the
detention cell.
CRUSHER [OC]: I need him in Sickbay, Captain.
PICARD: The cell, Doctor. Whatever equipment you need will be brought
to you there.
CRUSHER [OC]: Very well. 
(Picard goes to his Ready room, and Troi follows)

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come.
TROI: Captain, I just wondered if there's anything you wanted to talk
about.
PICARD: I don't think so, Counsellor.
TROI: I would have thought having a Borg on the ship would stir some
feelings.
PICARD: I'm quite recovered from my experience, thank you.
TROI: Sometimes even when a victim has dealt with his assault there are
residual effects of the event that linger. You were treated violently
by the Borg. 
Kidnapped, assaulted,
mutilated. 
PICARD: Counsellor. Counsellor, I very much appreciate your concern for
me, but I can assure you it is quite misplaced. I have carefully
considered the implications of having a Borg on this
ship. I have weighed the possible risks, and I am convinced that we are
doing the right thing. Now, I am quite comfortable with my decision.
TROI: I see. Well, if at any point you want to talk more.
PICARD: I shall certainly avail myself of your help.

[Brig]

(Crusher is treating the Borg inside the cell) 
WORF: Lower the forcefield.
(a medic enters the cell and the forcefield is raised again. Picard
enters the Brig) 
WORF: Captain, the Borg is still unconscious.
CRUSHER: He suffered massive internal injuries. We've been able to
control the haemorrhaging, but some of the implants in his brain were
damaged. I may have to remove them.
PICARD: The Borg will die if they're removed permanently. Their brains
grow dependent on the biochips.
CRUSHER: Perhaps Geordi can construct some new implants. 
LAFORGE: They contain relatively straightforward programming, interface
protocols. We have the files we downloaded after your experience,
Captain. I think I can manage it.
PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you know enough about Borg programming to
alter the pathways to their root command structure?
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, sir. The subroutines are pretty complicated. I'd
probably have to study the data processing algorithms. It's the only
way I could trace the access codes.
PICARD: If we could get to the root command, we could introduce an
invasive programming sequence through its biochip system and then
return it to the hive. 
LAFORGE: The Borg are so interconnected it would act like a virus.
PICARD: Which would infect the entire Collective. We could disable
their neural network at a stroke.
CRUSHER: Infect it? You make it sound like a disease.
PICARD: Quite right, Doctor. If all goes well, a terminal one.
