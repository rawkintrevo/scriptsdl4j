PICARD: Where is Data now? 
TROI: He should be in his quarters. You ordered him not to leave. 
(Picard activates the computer interface) 
PICARD: Tell me, where is Lieutenant Commander Data? 
COMPUTER: Current location, Ten forward. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, will you go to Ten forward and keep an eye on
Data? Don't interfere with his actions unless you hear otherwise from
me. 
WORF [OC]: Worf here, sir. Acknowledged. 
PICARD: I want to know more about what happened down on Gravesworld.
Lieutenant Selar, report to the Captain's ready room. 
[Ten forward]

DATA: Hello, Kareen. Don't you think it's time we
stopped pretending? You know who I am. 
KAREEN: You're Data. 
DATA: You do know who I am. 
KAREEN: Ira? 
DATA: It is me. I am here. I am alive. 
KAREEN: How? 
(Worf enters, and Data notices him) 
DATA: I deactivated Data and transferred my mind into his frame. I
never imagined how much of my self I would retain. My feelings, my
dreams. 
KAREEN: They won't let you get away with it. They'll try to stop you. 
DATA: How can they? It is my body now. It is out of their hands. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: Doctor, tell me. How much time did Data and
Graves spend together? 
SELAR: They were together practically the entire time we were on the
planet. 
PICARD: Always alone? 
TROI: Yes. Always. 
PICARD: Doctor, what was your impression of Graves? 
SELAR: He seemed brilliant, egocentric, arrogant, chauvinistic. 
PICARD: Sound familiar? 
[Ten forward]

DATA: Something wonderful has happened. I can take
a deep breath now without feeling stabbing pain. I will never have to
face death again. Think of the things I will accomplish over the next
thousand years! What? Oh, I know what
you're thinking. There is no need to worry. I will create an android
body for you, too. We can witness the end of time together. Why are you
crying, Kareen? I can love you now. The way I always wanted to. It was
not right before. I was too old for you, too weak. Now I can be
everything you want me to be. 
KAREEN: I won't let you put me in a machine. I want to live my life. I
won't let you take it away from me. Ira! Ira, you're hurting me! 
(Data has been squeezing her hand. He jumps up and leaves) 
WORF: Worf to Captain Picard.
