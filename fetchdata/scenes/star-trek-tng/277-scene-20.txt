(Captained by Beverly Picard) 
CRUSHER: (to Data and Geordi) Well, this is a page from the past. I
never thought I'd see either of you on a starship again. 
LAFORGE: Hello, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Geordi. 
DATA: Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Data. 
(then she goes to Picard and they can't decide whether to shake or hug)

PICARD: Let's just choose one. 
CRUSHER: All right. 
(they hug) 
PICARD: So, did you get my message? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Jean-Luc, crossing into Klingon territory. It's absurd.
But then I never could say no to you. 
PICARD: Oh. So that's why you married me. 
CRUSHER: Well now, the first order of business is to get clearance to
cross the Klingon border. 
LAFORGE: Agreed. What about Worf? 
PICARD: Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us.
LAFORGE: Data, isn't Worf still a member of the Klingon High Council? 
DATA: I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure is
hard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governor
of H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border.
CHILTON: Captain Picard? 
PICARD + CRUSHER: Yes? 
CHILTON: Captain, McKinley Station is signalling. They want to know
when we'll be docking. 
CRUSHER: Tell McKinley we've been called away on a priority mission. 
CHILTON: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: So, you kept the name. 
CRUSHER: I've prepared quarters for you on deck five. You might want to
get some rest. 
PICARD: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. 
CRUSHER: Nell, please escort the Ambassador to his quarters. 
PICARD: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a
few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not
want to be patronised. 
CRUSHER: You're right. I'm sorry. 
PICARD: Now, I'll go and get some rest. 
(Picard leaves) 
CRUSHER: How long since his last neurological scan? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, but I wouldn't try suggesting it. He says he's
not taking any more damn tests. 
CRUSHER: Do you really think he's moving through time? (silence) I'm
not sure I do either. But he's Jean-Luc Picard and if he wants to go on
one more mission, that's what we're going to do. 
[Future - Pasteur turbolift]

PICARD: We'll find the anomaly. I know we will. 
(and steps out into)

[Past - Bridge]

PICARD: Report. 
O'BRIEN: We're nearing the coordinates you gave me, sir. 
PICARD: Is there anything unusual in the vicinity, Mister Data? 
DATA: How would you define unusual, sir? Every region of space has its
own unique properties that cannot be found anywhere else. 
PICARD: There should be a barrier of some sort nearby. A large plasma
field, highly disruptive. 
DATA: Nothing, sir. 
PICARD: This is the right time, the right place. He should be here now.

O'BRIEN: Who, sir? 
PICARD: Q! We're here! This has gone on long enough! Counsellor, do you
sense an alien presence? 
TROI: No, sir. 
WORF: What is a Q? 
TASHA: It's a letter of the alphabet, as far as I know. 
PICARD: I don't understand. This is not the way it's supposed to
happen. Maintain this position. I'll be in my Ready room.
