LAFORGE: I'm going to try re-calibrating the field
generators. I still don't see why we can't get the engines started. It
just doesn't make any sense. 
PEEPLES: Someone's still here. 
LAFORGE: What did you say, Ensign? 
PEEPLES: Can't you hear it? There's someone still alive on the ship! I
heard, I mean, I thought I heard something. 
LAFORGE: The ship was searched thoroughly. There's nobody left on
board. 
PEEPLES: Sorry, sir. My mistake. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry about it. There were thirty four people were found
dead on this ship. That's enough to make anybody uneasy. 
PEEPLES: Thank you, sir.

TROI [OC]: I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell me about
the voices you hear. 
HAGAN [OC]: Bright. Bright out there. 
TROI [OC]: I don't understand. Bright what? Tell me more.

(Miles is pacing when Keiko enters) 
KEIKO: Boy, what a day this was. I'm doing an isozyme study on some
populations of Cardilia but they're turning out to have these really
weird polymorphisms. What a headache! 
O'BRIEN: Is that why you're late? 
KEIKO: Oh, no, I had a conference with Doctor Balthus. She wants to do
a study on the laticifer ontogeny of the Kaladian Thorn Flower, but I
don't have time to oversee another project. 
O'BRIEN: Was Tom Corbin there? 
KEIKO: What? 
O'BRIEN: Tom Corbin from the science lab. Remember him? 
KEIKO: Of course I remember him, but 
O'BRIEN: You use any excuse you can to pay him a visit. 
KEIKO: Miles, what are you saying? 
O'BRIEN: I think you know exactly what I'm saying. 
KEIKO: If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous. 
O'BRIEN: Do you take me for a fool?
