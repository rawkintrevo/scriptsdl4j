PICARD RIKER JAKE DATA

[Bridge]

RIKER: He'll need another thirty seconds before he
can restart. 
DATA: Irrelevant, sir. Even if he restarts his engine now, he will not
have enough thrust to escape impact. 
PICARD: Mister Kurland, you are not going to die out there. You are
going to do exactly what I tell you. Now, take the nose of the
shuttlecraft and aim it directly at Relva Seven.

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Aim it at Relva? I can't do that. It's crazy.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do it! 
JAKE [OC]: But I'll burn up! 
DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I am
giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva!

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Okay. It's done. 
PICARD [OC]: Good. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Now, monitor your speed exactly. When it
hits point zero two zero, I want you to restart the engine 
[Shuttlecraft]

PICARD [OC]: And when I tell you, pull up hard.
JAKE: Point zero two zero speed. Captain, I sure hope you're right. 
PICARD [OC]: You'll just have to trust me. 
JAKE: Point zero zero three. 
[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero zero nine. Zero one two. 
DATA: Six seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Hold on, Jake. It's going to be a little bumpy.
