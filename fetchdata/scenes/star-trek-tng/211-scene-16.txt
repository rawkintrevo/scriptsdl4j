TIMOTHY TROI LAFORGE PICARD HUTCHINSON RIKER CRUSHER DATA TEACHER

[Vico]

HUTCHINSON [OC]: Commander Riker. You'll have to
get him out into the corridor. 
DATA: I could move the beam, sir. However, it may initiate the collapse
of the surrounding supports. I recommend you and Geordi return to the
ship. 
RIKER: Agreed. La Forge. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and La Forge are beamed in) 
HUTCHINSON: I'm locked onto Commander Data and the boy, sir. I'll
energise as soon as they've cleared the bulkheads. 
RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Data. 
DATA [OC]: Yes, sir. 
[Vico]

TIMOTHY: Are you're going to lift that? 
DATA: Yes. Then I will take you to the corridor. We will transport back
to the Enterprise from there. Do you understand? 
TIMOTHY: How come you can pick up something so heavy? 
DATA: I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It is
going to be okay. I will count to three. One two three. 
(he pushes up the beam with one hand, Timothy wriggles out and runs.
Data drops the beam and follows, picking the boy up when he stumbles at
the steps)
DATA: Energise.

Captain's log, supplemental. A thorough search of
the Vico has revealed no additional survivors. We have begun the
process of counselling the boy with regard to the tragedy.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Don't be afraid. 
(a little while later) 
TIMOTHY: We were in the Black Cluster. I don't know where they came
from. They had a big ship and they kept shooting at us. Then they
beamed over. They had purple helmets on and phaser rifles. I saw them.
They didn't see me. 
CRUSHER: You're safe now, Timothy. I'm sorry for what happened. It's
going to be all right. I bet you're hungry. Would you like me to get
you something to eat? 
(Timothy nods and Crusher leaves) 
DATA: Counsellor, I must join Commander La Forge in Engineering. If you
will excuse me. 
(but Timothy is holding onto Data's hand) 
TROI: Timothy, would you like Data to stay with you a little bit
longer?
(a little nod)

[Engineering]

(looking at a schematic of the Vico on a wall
monitor) 
LAFORGE: Sections of the primary and secondary hull were torn right
off. The shearing planes are here, here, and here. 
PICARD: How much longer till we can access their logs? 
LAFORGE: Almost an hour. 
PICARD: The boy was here. 
LAFORGE: The hallway outside the computer core. His mother was the
ship's systems engineer. The second away team found her
body here inside the core. 
PICARD: And his father? 
LAFORGE: Ship's second officer. He was most likely on the bridge when
it was exposed to space. 
PICARD: Most likely. 
[Sickbay]

(Timothy falls asleep and Data is freed from his
grip) 
CRUSHER: He'll sleep for a few hours at least. I don't need to keep him
here but I will need to see him again tomorrow.
You've got some work cut out for you. 
TROI: His world is gone, Data. We're going to have to help him build a
new one.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: This is not good. Whatever hit the Vico
must have set up an EM pulse that flashed through their computer banks.

DATA: Nearly eighty three percent of their records have been lost. 
LAFORGE: And all of their sensor logs. Let's use what we got from our
own sensors. I'll call up the structural analysis and the surface
scans. 
DATA: Geordi, as a child, did you ever experience a traumatic event? 
LAFORGE: You're wondering about Timothy? 
DATA: Yes. 
LAFORGE: I was caught in a fire once. I must have been, I don't know,
about five, I guess. It was before I got the first visor. And it was
only a couple of minutes before my parents found me and pulled me out.
And nobody got hurt, but I tell you that was the longest couple of
minutes of my life. It was a while after that before I could even let
my parents get out of earshot. It was like I absolutely needed to know
that they were there, you know? 
DATA: Timothy no longer has that kind of support. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
[Classroom]

(the male teacher is reading aloud to the quiet and
attentive pupils, who are following on their PADDS, except one) 
TEACHER: Dara and her brother found themselves in the land of Tagas
where the ruler, Elamos the Magnificent, had proclaimed as law. 'No
children will be tolerated within the Great Kingdom'. When Dara saw the
proclamation, she just laughed, and said, 'How magnificent a ruler, to
be frightened by the likes of us.' Timothy, we're done with sculpture
for now. 
TIMOTHY: It's not finished. 
(putting a portico on a model building) 
TEACHER: We'll come back to it next period. Why don't you pick up your
mythology book and follow along? 
TIMOTHY: But it's not finished. 
(the worried teacher casts a glance towards Troi watching through the
window)
