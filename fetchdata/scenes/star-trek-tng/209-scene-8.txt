DATA RASMUSSEN

[Turbolift]

(Rasmussen is peering closely at Data) 
RASMUSSEN: This is really a thrill, Data, like running across a
Redstone missile or a Gutenberg bible. To think, the Model T of
androids.

[Corridor]

DATA: If you're referring to the first production
model automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent Model
A might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong's
revised prototype. 
RASMUSSEN: I stand corrected.

[Rasmussen's quarters]

DATA: Is there a problem, Professor? 
RASMUSSEN: I suppose it will have to do, for now. I'll get you a list
of the things I'll be needing, okay? 
DATA: Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whether
or not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century? 
(Rasmussen washes his hands and then holds them out for a towel. Data
obliges) 
DATA: Since you seemed to know so much about Captain Picard and the
ship, I assumed that you would. 
RASMUSSEN: It'd be best if you kept your assumptions to yourself,
wouldn't it? 
DATA: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

Captain's log, stardate 45350.3. We have arrived at
Penthara Four and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation
caused by the asteroid impact.
