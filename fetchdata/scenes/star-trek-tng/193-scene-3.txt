[Shuttle]

LAFORGE: Enterprise, this is shuttle five in
position, ready to begin a short-range scan. 
RIKER [OC]: Proceed, shuttle five. 
LAFORGE: Reg, why don't we begin with the passive high-res series, all
right? 
BARCLAY: Electromagnetic band? 
LAFORGE: Give it a try. 
BARCLAY: I'm picking up visual wavelengths only. Between forty five
hundred and seven thousand angstroms. 
LAFORGE: Let's try the neutron densitometer. 
BARCLAY: Nothing. 
LAFORGE: Hmm. Doesn't seem to want to give up any secrets. Let's go to
active scan. 
BARCLAY: No, no modulation. 
LAFORGE: Really? You are definitely not from our neighbourhood.
Increase to three point zero. 
BARCLAY: Commander? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Reg? 
BARCLAY: Thanks for assigning me to this mission. 
LAFORGE: Don't mention it. You're one of my top engineers. It's about
time you got in on some of the interesting stuff. This, this is why I'm
in Starfleet. 
BARCLAY: There's still no modulation. 
LAFORGE: Hit it with a positron emission. 
(there's a big flare of light from the probe) 
LAFORGE: What was that? Computer's down, Reg. Reg? 
(but Barclay is spark out on the floor)

Captain's log, supplemental. An intense energy
surge from the alien probe has severely
disabled the shuttle's onboard computer. The away team has been
transported directly to Sickbay, where Lieutenant Barclay remains under
observation.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Any indication of the probe's energy source,
Data? 
DATA: No, sir. Power emissions do not match any known radiation
patterns. We have not encountered this technology before, sir. 
PICARD: Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take it
to Science Station four oh two in the Kohlan system. 
WORF: Captain, the probe has begun to move. It is approaching the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
