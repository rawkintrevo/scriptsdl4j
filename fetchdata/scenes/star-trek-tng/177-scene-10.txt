Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, recognise Jean-Luc Picard, Alpha Two priority, and
re-establish separation procedure immediately.

from your present location. 
PICARD: And just what location are they accepted from? 
COMPUTER: Interface terminals on main Bridge only. 
WESLEY: You're the only one who has clearance to localise command
functions. 
PICARD: It seems Commander Data has it them as well.

WORF: The isolinear subprocessor extends three point five metres. 
RIKER: I've got a clear path to panel J14 baker. What's that going to

WORF: J14 baker backs onto science station two, Commander. 
RIKER: Have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer? 
WORF: Yes, sir. Life support has been re-established. 
RIKER: Then you and Casey get up here. Let's get to it.
