CRUSHER: The cellular residue is completely fused
with to metal of the deck plate. We're trying to micro-vaporise the
metal in order to get a clear DNA sample. 
PICARD: Do you have any idea what killed her? 
CRUSHER: Well this is just a guess, but from the molecular deposition
on the plating I'd say it was a high-level phaser blast. 
RIKER: Could it have been a Klingon disruptor? 
CRUSHER: Possibly. 
RIKER: Geordi's found evidence that the encrypted messages have been
tampered with, and we are close to Klingon space. 
PICARD: There hasn't been a Klingon raid against the Federation for
more than seven years. We can't risk a diplomatic incident until we
have more evidence. 
CRUSHER: And there's still the question of what happened to Lieutenant
Rocha. 
PICARD: Get Rocha's personnel file from Starfleet Command, and ask
Starbase two twelve to help us find that shuttle. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Keep me apprised, Doctor.

(the monitor screen is still stubbornly displaying
static) 
LAFORGE: All right, let's try this again. Come on, this should be
working. The phase inducters are aligned. Come on, Lieutenant, I know
you're in here somewhere. Computer me run a subsystem diagnostic, with
a frequency range of ten to one hundred megahertz. 
COMPUTER: Diagnostic cycle will be complete in twenty seconds. 
LAFORGE: Iced coffee? 
(the replicator produces his drink and the dog barks) 
LAFORGE: What is it, girl? 
(he's finally got an image - of a young dark-skinned alien woman) 
AQUIEL [on monitor]: Hello, Shiana. By the time you get this the
Batarael will be over. This is the first time I haven't been there.
I've been wondering, who's singing the Horath in my place. (sings)
Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia. Rumael tavariel fatra di va Jomiael.
(next letter) I had that dream again. The one where Mother is
screaming. I climb the hill to our house but I can't get to her.
Shiana, this time I ran away. I was so scared I ran back down the hill.
I think I know why I've been having the dreams about danger. It's
because of what's been happening with that Klingon. He's getting more
aggressive all the time. Not just the usual threat. 
(Geordi rewinds the message) 
AQUIEL [on monitor]: It's because of what's been happening with that
Klingon. He's getting more aggressive all the time. Not just the usual
threat. Morag actually locked his disruptors to the station this time.
I don't think there'll be any trouble. It just brings up those feelings
of panic, of wanting to run, wanting to get away from danger. Shiana, I
couldn't say this to anyone but you, but the panic? It's the same thing
I used to feel whenever Father got angry, when I knew he was going to
punish me. Only now, I'm out here in space, and there's no place to
run.
