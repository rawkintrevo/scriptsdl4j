[Bridge]

DATA: Power loss now at twelve percent, Captain. 
PICARD: Red alert. 
WORF: Radiation intensity increasing. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We'd better slow these engines down before we burn out
the reaction chamber. 
RIKER: Slow to idle, Geordi. 
PICARD: Is it possible we've fallen into the same snare that killed
them? A thousand year old booby trap?

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: With the engines idling, the energy loss
has been limited, but our reserves will be depleted in less than three
hours. We won't be able to hold our shields in place. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, have you been able to identify the source of the
radiation? 
WORF: No, sir. The radiation field is so strong it interferes with our
sensors. 
PICARD: And no apparent explanation for the energy loss? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. 

RIKER: Is there anything in the history books, Data, that could give us
a clue? 
DATA: There are many fascinating records of Menthar battle strategy.
They were exceptionally innovative. In fact, they were the first to use
the Kavis Teke elusive manoeuvre as well as the passive lure stratagem
that is comparable to Napoleon's 
RIKER: Any mention of a situation like this? 
DATA: No, sir. 
RIKER: I recommend that I return to the cruiser with an away team. 
LAFORGE: They didn't have much success with this problem, Commander. 
RIKER: No, but they knew who their enemy was better than we do. They
may have known what caused the trouble. They just didn't know how to
get out. 
PICARD: Agreed. Mister Worf, what would be the impact of lowering the
shields long enough to get the away team out? 
WORF: Negligible. 
LAFORGE: Won't do much for our energy conservation, Captain. 
PICARD: That's your job, Commander La Forge. Determine some way to keep
the Enterprise up and running. Data, you join Commander Riker on the
away team. Find out what happened on that ship.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: So why can't we move? Computer. As we
increased our power levels, was there any counter-reaction? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. The opposing force grew in direct proportion to
the power output of the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: So it kept us from forming a subspace field for the warp
drive? 
COMPUTER: That is correct. 
(He goes to a screen and calls up files) 
LAFORGE: Computer, who is this L. Brahms? 
COMPUTER: Doctor Leah Brahms, engineer. Graduate of the Daystrom
Institute Theoretical Propulsion Group. Galaxy class starships, team
seven, junior member. 
LAFORGE: Junior member, huh? Looks like she wrote the book on
propulsion. Call up subspace design logs. 
COMPUTER: Select menu. Visual records or L. Brahms' voice entries. 
LAFORGE: Voice entries. 
LEAH [OC]: Theoretical propulsion logs, Federation Starship Enterprise,
Galaxy class. Heading, Subspace. Author, Leah Brahms. 
LAFORGE: Geordi La Forge. How're you doing, Doc? 
LEAH [OC]: Specify programme. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, down to work. You're absolutely right.
