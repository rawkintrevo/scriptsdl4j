GOSS RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY ARRIDOR CRUSHER

[Ready room]

GOSS: You attempt to gain every unfair advantage,
Picard. 
PICARD: Premier Bhavani has no objection. 
GOSS: Well, I most certainly do. First, you conveniently arrange to
play host, then you plan to send your own manned probe into the
wormhole. The Federation thinks it can do anything it wants to. Well, I
will not tolerate it! 
PICARD: I will gladly share the results of our exploration with all the
delegates. 
GOSS: And you expect us to believe what you report? 
RIKER: Then send in your own probe, Goss. 
GOSS: That's exactly what I intend to do. And I should strongly suggest
you stay out of our way. 
(The Ferengi's leave) 
PICARD: Tell Data and La Forge to do themselves a favour, and stay out
of their way. 
(Riker leaves) 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain Picard, please come to Sickbay. 
PICARD: Acknowledged, Doctor.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Whatever he's got is obviously not life
threatening. It's some kind of system-wide histaminic reaction. He
certainly can't go back to negotiations for several days. 
PICARD: Will you keep me informed? 
[Corridor]

PICARD: The Federation's top negotiator taken out
by a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? 
RIKER: With the Ferengi around? Always. 
PICARD: You'll have to fill in, Number One. 
RIKER: Me? 
PICARD: Well, I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkward
transition. You're the next likely choice. And Mister Mendoza
will certainly agree. He's quite impressed by your natural instincts. 
RIKER: Excuse me, sir, but those weren't natural instincts. Those were
poker instincts. A card game doesn't exactly prepare me for this. 
PICARD: Yes, the stakes are higher. But then, isn't that when the game
gets interesting, Commander?

[Bridge]

WESLEY: The wormhole will reappear in thirty
seconds, sir. 
WORF: The Ferengi pod is moving into position. 
PICARD: Shuttle nine, stand by. 
[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: Ferengi pod, this is Lieutenant Commander
La Forge in the Enterprise shuttle. 
ARRIDOR [OC]: This is Doctor Arridor, go ahead. 
LAFORGE: Would you care to take the point, Doctor?
