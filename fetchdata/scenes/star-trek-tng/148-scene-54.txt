PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I want
you there when the away team returns. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
[Batris Corridor]

LAFORGE: Commander, we are out of time. This ship
is blowing. 
RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? 
[Transporter room]

TASHA: Too much interference. You have to get
farther away from the Engineering section.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Engineering section is critical.
Destruction of the Batris is imminent. 
PICARD: They're out of options. Do it!

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Now! 
(The first attempt fails and the group arrive back on the Batris as
explosions head towards them. The ship goes bang.)

TROI: The growth rate's almost down to zero.
