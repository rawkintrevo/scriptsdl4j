TIMICIN LAFORGE [OC] DATA LAFORGE
seventeen cubic shock congratulations heat fusion holding seventy centimetre

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Five seconds. Four. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Three seconds. Now. Shock wave patterns
within predicted range. Seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma
radiation levels. Helium
fusion rate increasing. 
TIMICIN: What about heat and pressure levels? 
LAFORGE: Steady so far. Density at eleven hundred grams per cubic
centimetre. Temperature approaching sixty million degrees Kelvin. 
TIMICIN: We want it to stabilise at two hundred and twenty million.

[Bridge]

DATA: Pressure wave harmonics dispersing.
Temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees,
sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Still rising.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Temperature at ninety million degrees
Kelvin. And now one hundred ten million. Looking good.
One hundred thirty seven. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Radiation and pressure levels still stable. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Temperature is one hundred and seventy million degrees
Kelvin.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: One ninety. And now two hundred million. 
TIMICIN: It's happening. 
LAFORGE: Two oh seven and rising. Two nineteen. And twenty. Two twenty.
And holding. Looks like congratulations may be in order.
