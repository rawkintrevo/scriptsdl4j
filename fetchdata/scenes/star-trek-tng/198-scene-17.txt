LAFORGE: Computer re-route the power flow in the
cargo bay four transporter to the auxiliary replicator system. 
COMPUTER: Please verify command with necessary protocol. 
LAFORGE: Initiate protocol three six four dash B. 
COMPUTER: Verify priority clearance. 
LAFORGE: Recognise La Forge, theta two nine nine seven. 
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. Power has been re-routed through auxiliary
power distribution system code number four four seven six two. 
LAFORGE: Now, redirect transporter mode to the planetary sensor array. 
COMPUTER: Transporter mode has been redirected. 
(a box is beamed away) 
LAFORGE: Verify that all record of these modifications are being erased
from each directory. 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Erasure process is proceeding.

(La Forge enters) 
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed by Governor Vagh. 
PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. Governor. 
VAGH [on viewscreen]: You astonish me, Picard. Did you seriously
believe you would succeed? Do you think we are blind? 
PICARD: I don't understand. 
VAGH [on viewscreen]: We intercepted the weapons you tried to transport
to the surface. 
PICARD: Governor, I assure you 
VAGH [on viewscreen]: Do not insult us both by denying it. Maintain
your position until further notice. Do not attempt to leave orbit. 
(transmission ends) 
WORF: Klingon attack cruiser uncloaking, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: Two birds of prey approaching. 
(shortly after) 
DATA: Sensors confirm an unauthorised transporter beam at eleven twenty
three hours. 
PICARD: Do you know which transporter was used? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, Captain. Whoever did it apparently used the
planetary array to bypass the transport sensors. 
RIKER: What about the transporter logs? 
LAFORGE: They're blank. 
RIKER: How many people on board are capable of doing this, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I'm not even sure how it was done yet. As soon as I find out,
maybe I can give you an answer. Not many, that's for sure. 
(Kell enters) 
KELL: Vagh is fully prepared to fire upon the Enterprise. I have
convinced him it would not be wise to take any action without first
consulting the High Council. 
RIKER: How long do we have? 
KELL: A few hours at most. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, your recommendations? 
LAFORGE: It might be possible to locate the point of origin by tracing
power flows at the time of transport. 
PICARD: Make it so.

[Engineering]

DATA: The primary plasma system does not indicate a
power drain from any of the transporters. 
LAFORGE: Then whoever used the transporter must have bypassed the
primary feeds. 
DATA: Tracking power from secondary systems. No surges to any of the
transporters indicated. 
LAFORGE: Damn, who could have pulled this off? Try the life-support
power flows. 
DATA: No abnormal surges indicated. 
LAFORGE: Replicator waveguides? There. That's not a replicator energy
pattern. Trace it. 
DATA: Cargo bay four. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Worf. Security to cargo bay four.
