KORRIS RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD DATA

[Batris Engineering]

DATA: I've found them, sir. The door to their
compartment is jammed. 
(They follow him around the warp core to a big door that is very
slightly open) 
DATA: The control mechanism's not operative, sir. 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker of the USS Enterprise. Do you hear me? 
DATA: I advise against the use of phasers, sir. The gas buildup is too
great. 
LAFORGE: He's right, sir. A phaser discharge now could blow us all out
of here. 
DATA: Shall I, sir? 
PICARD [OC]: Number One, what's going on? 
RIKER: We're about to force the door. 
(Data makes the gap big enough for Riker to step through into the
compartment) 
PICARD [OC]: What is it? What do you see? 
RIKER: Klingons.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Klingons? 
[Batris compartment]

(There are two Klingons standing there) 
KORRIS: I am Korris. 
RIKER: We'll handle the formalities later. Right now we have to get off
this ship. Are there any others survivors? 
KORRIS: No. 
DATA: I believe I have found a quicker way out of here, sir. 
RIKER: Check him out. 
(There is a body on a table) 
DATA: He is alive, sir, but just barely. 
RIKER: Then pick the body and let's get out of here. 
KORRIS: No. I will carry him. 
DATA: As you wish. 
LAFORGE: Come on, let's go!

PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I want
you there when the away team returns. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
[Batris Corridor]

LAFORGE: Commander, we are out of time. This ship
is blowing. 
RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? 
[Transporter room]

TASHA: Too much interference. You have to get
farther away from the Engineering section.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Engineering section is critical.
Destruction of the Batris is imminent. 
PICARD: They're out of options. Do it!
