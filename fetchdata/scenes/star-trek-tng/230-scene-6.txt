wee area visit gymnasium try need array captain admiral

[Scott's quarters]

KANE: This is the food replicator, and your
computer terminal. 
SCOTT: Good Lord, man, where have you put me? 
KANE: These are standard guest quarters, sir. I can try and find
something bigger if you want. 
SCOTT: Bigger? In my day, even an Admiral wouldn't have had such
quarters on a starship. You know, I remember a time we had to transport
the
 Dohlman of Elaas.
You never heard anyone whine and complain so much about quarters as she
did. 
KANE: The holodecks, Ten Forward, and the gymnasium are all at your
disposal. The computer can tell you how to find them. Until we issue
you a combadge, just use one of these panels if you need anything. 
SCOTT: You know, these quarters remind me of a hotel room on Argelius.
Oh, now there
is a planet. Everything a man wants right at his fingertips. Of course,
on the first visit, I got into a wee bit of trouble. 
KANE: Excuse me, sir but I have to return to duty. 
SCOTT: Oh. Well then. Thank you.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I want you to shut down the warp engines
and recalibrate the aft sensors while I work on the lateral array. 
BARTEL: Aye, sir. 
BARTEL [OC]: Can I help you, sir? 
SCOTT [OC]: Oh, I don't think so, lassie, but I'll let you know if you
can. 
BARTEL [OC]: Sir, this area is restricted to authorised personnel 
LAFORGE: Bartel, it's okay. I'll handle it. Captain Scott, this really
isn't 
SCOTT: We're in Engineering. Call me Scotty. 
LAFORGE: Scotty, this really isn't a good time for a tour. We're
running a phase seven survey of the Dyson Sphere. 
SCOTT: I'm not here for a tour, laddie. I'm here to help. 
LAFORGE: That's very kind, but I'm sure we can handle it. 
SCOTT: I was a Starfleet engineer for fifty two years, Mister La Forge.
I think I'm still useful. 
LAFORGE: You're right. We'd be grateful for any help you can give us. 
SCOTT: Good. Let's get to work.
