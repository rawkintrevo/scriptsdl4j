(at red alert) 
LAFORGE: We just lost contact with everything above deck twenty one,
including the Bridge. 
WORF: There is something wrong with one of the antimatter containment
units. The magnetic field is starting to fluctuate. 
TROI: Switch to auxiliary control. 
WORF: Auxiliary control is not online. We are starting to lose
containment on antimatter storage unit three. 
TROI: All right. Switch the EM power inverter to the lateral. No, wait.

RIKER: Congratulations. You just destroyed the Enterprise. 
TROI: Thank you for the encouragement. 
RIKER: Don't feel bad. You passed everything else. Diplomatic law,
first contact procedures, Bridge operations. The Engineering
qualification's one of the toughest parts of the test. 
TROI: So what did I do wrong? 
RIKER: I'm afraid I can't tell you that. 
TROI: Why not? What kind of a test is this? 
RIKER: It's the kind of a test that you'll have to take again if you
want to be a Bridge Officer. Only next time, the problem won't be so
easy, so I suggest you study up on your emergency procedures. 
TROI: Well how do I know what to study if you won't tell me what I did
wrong? 
RIKER: I don't know. I'm afraid I can't tell you that either.
