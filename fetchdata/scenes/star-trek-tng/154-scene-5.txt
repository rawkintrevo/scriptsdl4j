PICARD RIKER OBRIEN DATA WORF

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Ready to beam down to the vessel? 
O'BRIEN: Locked on to the main bridge, Captain. 
RIKER: You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data ? 
DATA: There is adequate oxygen for life support, Commander. 
PICARD: It is exactly as they left it, Number One. In the bottle. The
ship in the bottle. Good Lord, didn't anybody here build ships in
bottles when they were boys? 
WORF: I did not play with toys. 
DATA: I was never a boy. 
O'BRIEN: I did, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed. 
(Picard, Worf and Data are beamed away) 
O'BRIEN: I did. I really did. Ships in bottles. Great fun. 
(The lights dim) 
RIKER: What's that? 
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure. The secondary power bus may need adjusting. 
RIKER: Keep me posted.

[Warship Bridge]

(built for human-sized humanoids with a ridge on
their skulls. Reminiscent of the scene from Alien when they found the
dead pilot) 
PICARD: Extraordinary. 
WORF: Admirable. They died at their posts. 
PICARD: Hmm. You'd expect the bridge layout of this era to be clumsy,
awkward, but look at this. It's a model of simplicity. Elegant,
functional. They built this craft for generations. And it worked.
