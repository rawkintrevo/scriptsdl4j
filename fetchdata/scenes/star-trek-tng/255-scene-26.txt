SILVA CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: We're receiving the probe's telemetry. 
DATA: The input levels are currently at fifty three percent of
tolerance. 
LAFORGE: That's too low, Data. I won't be able to do anything down
there. 
CRUSHER: I want to start with as wide a margin of safety as possible.
We can adjust upward later. Ready? 
LAFORGE: Go ahead. 
DATA: Initiating interface. 
LAFORGE: I can't see anything. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

DATA [OC]: I am increasing the input now. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. Yeah, that's better, but I need more. 
DATA [OC]: Is this level sufficient? Geordi? Geordi, do you hear me? 
(but Geordi is staring at a woman in a Starfleet uniform standing in
front of him) 
LAFORGE: Mom? Mom, is it you? 
SILVA: Is it you? 
LAFORGE: Oh, I forgot. All you can see is this probe. Yes, it's me. I'm
actually on the Enterprise. I'm interfaced with this probe. 
[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: Geordi, who are you speaking to? What are
you seeing? 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: But is it really you? 
SILVA: Yes, Geordi. It's mom. 
LAFORGE: But bow can that be? I mean, how is it possible? 
SILVA: There's no time to explain. We have to go down. 
LAFORGE: Down where? 
SILVA: The surface.

CRUSHER: Geordi, report.
