[Science lab]

LAFORGE: The forcefield's ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Activate it. 
(The forcefield goes up around a single examination table in the middle
of the room) 
PICARD: Transporter? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: This is Chief O'Brien, sir. Almost ready. 
PICARD: Is there a problem? 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: It's the styrolite. I'm altering the
delta-T so the styrolite coding materialises two micro-seconds ahead of
the child.

[Science lab]

O'BRIEN [OC]: It has to be right the first time. 
PICARD: Well take all the time you need. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Entering corrections now, sir. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Ready, Captain. 
[Science lab]

PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, are you ready to
transport? 
GUEST0 [OC]: You have the coordinates. We have one twelve year old
male encased in number six styrolite. 
LAFORGE: Transporter, energise. 
(A male older than twelve appears on the table) 
WORF: A trick! 
LAFORGE: Transporter, reverse 
PICARD: One moment, Lieutenant. Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. 
PULASKI: The styrolite is intact, Captain. 
PICARD: Force field down. 
TROI: Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality.
Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is unquestionably
telepathic. 
PULASKI: A child this mature? We could be looking at the future of
humanity. 
PICARD: At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. 
(Later, as two nurses do most of the examining with various
instruments, Picard returns to the lab) 
PULASKI: This child is in better health than we are. His immune system
is so advanced it may not be possible for him to contract disease. I
want to free him from the styrolite. 
PICARD: That seems rather risky, Doctor. 
PULASKI: I can do no further tests until he's out of it. 
PICARD: But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree.

PULASKI: I know I'm right. 
PICARD: I can't expose the Enterprise until I know where this disease
came from and how it is transmitted. 
PULASKI: I realise that, Captain. Naturally, we'll establish a force
field containment. 
PICARD: But if we lose the force field for any reason, we lose the
ship. Force fields can fail, and until 
PULASKI: We don't have that kind of time. These children can't survive
in the lab once their parents are dead. Look at him, Captain. He's a
human being who needs our help. 
PICARD: But the risk is 
PULASKI: Minimal. 
PICARD: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless without
risk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,
God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it if
you'd let me finish my sentences once in a while.
