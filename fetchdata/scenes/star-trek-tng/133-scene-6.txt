WORF: Quarantine warnings active on all
frequencies, Captain. 
LANTREE [OC]: Extreme caution. The USS Lantree is a quarantined vessel
by order of Starfleet Command. Do not board. 
PICARD: Set course for Gagarin Four, warp seven. 
WESLEY: Course and speed set, sir. 
PICARD: Engage. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We're en route to the
Federation Research station on Gagarin Four. The mere thought of a
possible connection between the Lantree tragedy and a genetic research
facility fills me with profound apprehension.

WESLEY: We're approaching Gagarin Four, Captain. 
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: Darwin Station, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. 
(A middle aged woman comes on the viewscreen. She seems harassed) 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, this is Darwin Station. I'm
Doctor Kingsley. We've just declared a medical emergency here. We need
your help. 
PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, what is the nature of your emergency? 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: To whom am I speaking, please? 
PULASKI: I'm Doctor Pulaski, Chief Medical Officer. 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Katherine Pulaski, author of Linear Models of
Viral Propagation? 
PULASKI: That was a long time ago. 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: But still the standard. I can't think of
anyone I'd rather be dealing with. Doctor, we're experiencing the rapid
onset of geriatric phenomena. The first symptom is sudden, acute
arthritic inflammation. Then the aging process accelerates. 
PULASKI: The Lantree. 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Doctor Pulaski, I celebrated my thirty fifth
birthday a week ago. 
PULASKI: Doctor, we understand that Darwin Station is involved in
genetic research. Is there a possible connection? 
KINGSLEY [on viewscreen]: Our research here is limited to human
genetics. I can assure you we're not dealing with something that got
away from us. We believe that we were infected by a supply ship that
was here three days ago. 
PICARD: Doctor, if you're speaking of the Lantree, we encountered it a
few hours ago. All the crew members were dead. 
KINGSLEY: Which would seem to confirm our suspicion. Were you able to
establish a pathology, Doctor? 
PICARD: Doctor, did you hear what I said? All the twenty six men and
women aboard that ship were dead. 
KINGSLEY: I heard you, Captain, and the prognosis is alarming, but my
immediate concern is our children. 
PULASKI: Children? 
KINGSLEY: They represent years of advanced genetic research. You must
evacuate them as soon as possible. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, but under the circumstances, until we know what's
going on I'm imposing a full quarantine on Darwin Station. 
KINGSLEY: But the children have been in protective isolation since this
was detected. They show no symptoms. You cannot leave them here to die!

PICARD: Doctor, our options in a quarantine situation are extremely
limited. We are going to consider the possibilities. I suggest you do
the same.
