TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER BARRON DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. 
LAFORGE: We've finished replicating the parts they'll need, but what I
don't understand is why a three man station would need a reactor
capable of producing four point two gigawatts. 
RIKER: Enough to power a small phaser bank, a subspace relay station,
or 
LAFORGE: A hologram generator. Oh, a duck blind. Right. They're
anthropologists. 
PICARD: Who are studying an extended family of Mintakans at close range
from a camouflaged observation post. 
TROI: According to Doctor Barron's preliminary reports, the Mintakans
are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful and
highly rational. 
PICARD: Which is not surprising, considering how closely their
evolution parallels Vulcan. 
WORF: Captain, incoming transmission from Mintaka Three. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. 
(a dodgy image with lots of interference lines) 
BARRON [on viewscreen]: Barron to Enterprise. Our temporary repairs
have failed. The reactor is now inoperative. 
PICARD: Do you have battery backup? 
BARRON [on viewscreen]: Three hours at best. 
DATA: Captain, if we increase to warp seven we can be there in twenty
three minutes. 
PICARD: Make it so. We're on our way. 
(They see a big explosion on the screen. One man escapes through the
now-exposed observation window on to the planet surface proper) 
WORF: We've lost contact, sir. 
PICARD: Increase to warp nine.
