PICARD GUINAN RIKER

[Cavern]

(Guinan is just coming round) 
PICARD: Gently. Don't sit up too quickly. 
GUINAN: Where'd everybody go? 
PICARD: I hope they're all safely back on the Enterprise by now. 
GUINAN: But you're still here. 
PICARD: You were hurt. I had to make sure you were all right. 
GUINAN: And so you stayed for that? 
PICARD: I didn't want anything to happen to you. You're far too
important to me. 
GUINAN: You know an awful lot about me. 
PICARD: Believe me, in the future the tables will be turned. 
GUINAN: So we become friends? 
PICARD: It goes far beyond friendship. 
GUINAN: Oh, but I'll have to wait almost five hundred years, and when
we meet I won't be able to tell you about this, will I? 
PICARD: No. Because for me, none of this will have happened yet. 
GUINAN: What's that? 
(Data's head) 
PICARD: That's history fulfilling itself.

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: History has to fulfill itself. Even Picard
knew that. 
RIKER: You were there in the cavern. You know what happened. What am I
supposed to do? 
GUINAN: If I told you what happened in that cavern, it would affect any
decision you'd make now. I can't do that. I won't. 
RIKER: Not telling me might affect my decision. Did you think of that?
We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it all
works out. I've got to do something.
