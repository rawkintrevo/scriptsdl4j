[Cavern]

(Picard picks up Data's head and opens the back,
then uses a piece of metal to do something to the circuits)

[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, I have set the photons to fire in
staggered rounds, detonating in ten second intervals. 
RIKER: Very well. Fire when ready. 
WORF: The sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute.

[Science lab]

LAFORGE: Computer, run another diagnostic on the
input polarisers. 
COMPUTER: Polariser circuits are functioning. 
LAFORGE: Well, then, that ought to do it. Okay, Data. Come on, now. 
DATA: Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary message
entered into my static memory by Captain Picard. Geordi, are we
planning to fire on the alien habitat? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but 
DATA: It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Riker. Hold your fire!

[Bridge]

DATA: The binary message left by the Captain is not
entirely clear. He seemed to be concerned about the phase differential
of our photon torpedoes. That firing them might produce catastrophic
effects. 
CRUSHER: Then how do we destroy their habitat? 
DATA: If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so that the force of
the explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum. 
LAFORGE: If we outfit the photons with phase discriminators we could
get the variance we need. 
RIKER: How long will it take you? 
LAFORGE: At least a couple of hours. 
RIKER: Fine. I'll have time to go get him. 
DATA: Sir? 
RIKER: I'm going back to the nineteenth century to get the Captain.
Doctor? 
CRUSHER: My analysis of the phasers suggests you'd be able to open the
rift, but it won't be stable enough to transport more than one person. 
RIKER: You mean if I go back, only one of us can return? 
CRUSHER: That's right. 
CLEMENS: Then I have the perfect solution for you. I'm the one who
should return to the nineteenth century and remain there so your
Captain can return here. 
RIKER: There's a risk. We're not sure how stable the rift will be. 
CLEMENS: There's risk in everything. The point is, it's the right
choice. I've got more books to write, and your Captain has a job to do
here. 
RIKER: Geordi, you'll brief him on what he needs to know? 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
CLEMENS: I'm glad I have the chance to thank you. 
DATA: For what, sir? 
CLEMENS: Why, for starting me out on the greatest adventure a man's
ever had. And for helping a bitter old man to open his eyes and see
that the future turned out pretty well after all.
