[Bridge]

RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, you may come down
now to conclude our discussions, or your ship may leave. It's your
choice. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations.

(They are beamed away) 
WORF: Transporter room, now!

[Aldean corridor]

(Data and Riker arrive safely and head off into) 
[Custodian room]

DATA: This is it, Commander. It is programmed to
accept only authorised voice command. 
RIKER: There's no way we can override. 
DATA: No, but I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. 
[First Unit]

RADUE: Before we begin, Captain, you must speak
with the children. It seems they are on some sort of strike. I don't
understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm not very good with
children. 
PICARD: Strike? I'll see what I can do.

[Wesley's room]

WESLEY: I'm sure if we just stick together, guys,
we'll all be 
(Picard beams in) 
KATIE: Hi, Captain Picard. 
HARRY: Hi, Captain. 
WESLEY: Sir, I knew you'd come. 
PICARD: It's not over yet, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I think I figured out their computer controls, sir, but I'm not
sure. It's a much different system than ours. 
PICARD: Good, Wesley. Now 
HARRY: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Harry. 
HARRY: If something happens and you have to leave us here, will you
tell my Dad that I'm sorry that I made him angry, and that I miss him. 
PICARD: You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much I
admire his son. Hello, Alexandra. 
ALEXANDRA: (Arms open for picking up) Hi. 
(So he does, uncomfortably, while she hangs on to her pet tribble. Did
I mention that before?)

[First Unit]

(The children and Picard beam in) 
RADUE: What is this? 
PICARD: They want to go home. 
RADUE: No. They're staying. 
PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: We're in position. 
PICARD: Hold for orders. 
CRUSHER: The radiation levels on Aldea have been building up over a
long period of time. It is similar to what was experienced on Earth in
the twenty-first century. When the ozone layer had deteriorated and the
surface of the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation. 
PICARD: The shield that protected your world in one way is weakening it
in another. It is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you.

RADUE: You're trying to confuse the issue. 
CRUSHER: Please, listen. You're all suffering from radiation poisoning.
Sterility is only the latest symptom. If the children remain, they will
be affected as well. 
RADUE: It's impossible. Our scientists would have known. 
CRUSHER: How could they? Your scientists have forgotten how everything
works. 
RADUE: No. All lies. 
RASHELLA: No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if they're right?
Instead of the children being our hope, what if we're just
condemning them to our fate? 
RADUE: Rashella, they're just protecting their own interests. 
RASHELLA: As are we. But hear them out. The Captain and Doctor Crusher
are saying that the very thing which has given us this wonderful world
is what has caused this tragedy. 
PICARD: That's it, exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you so
completely you've lost even the desire to even question it. 
RADUE: Lies, and the discussion is over. 
(He tries his arm device, but nothing happens) 
PICARD: Commander Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Here, sir. 
PICARD: I assume you have control of the computer. 
RIKER [OC]: We've disabled the system temporarily.
