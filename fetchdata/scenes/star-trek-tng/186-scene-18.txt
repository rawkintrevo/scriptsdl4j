BOTH RIKER OBRIEN WORF PICARD ENSIGN MACET MAXWELL DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, how long until we clear
Cardassian space? 
DATA: At our present speed, three hours, twenty minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet.
Inform him of our projected time of arrival. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. 
MACET: What is he doing? 
PICARD: Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, will you hail
Captain Maxwell? 
WORF: No response, sir. 
RIKER: Data, project his new course. 
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vessel
point one two light years from our location. 
MACET: He'll attack that ship just as he did the others. 
PICARD: Continue the hail, Mister Worf. Priority one message. Do you
know what that ship might be? 
MACET: I imagine it's a supply ship, headed for the research station in
the Kelrabi system. 
WORF: The Phoenix still does not respond, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not be
able to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp nine. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer. 
PICARD: Get him up here. 
(a short time later, O'Brien enters) 
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached the
Cardassian vessel. 
RIKER: Slow to impulse. 
WORF: Vessels are within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER: Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems? 
DATA: Negative, sir. Their phaser banks are not armed. 
RIKER: What about the Cardassians? 
DATA: Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassian
defensive systems. Their ship is running with a high powered subspace
field. 
PICARD: Mister O'Brien, your former Commander, a Federation Captain, is
about to place me in the position of firing on his ship. I need your
knowledge of the man. How he thinks, what he's capable of doing. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Sir, Captain Maxwell is hailing us. 
PICARD: On screen. 
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: All right, Picard. You need proof? You've got
it now. 
PICARD: Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. 
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: Board the ship, you'll see that everything
I've been saying is true. 
PICARD: The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transport
yourself aboard the Enterprise 
MAXWELL [on viewscreen]: Picard, if you don't board that ship, I'll
destroy it. 
PICARD: And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from
taking that action, Captain. 
(transmission ends) 
O'BRIEN: Sir, Captain Maxwell, if he feels his back is to the wall,
he'll strike. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. 
WORF: They're arming phasers and loading forward torpedo bays. 
PICARD: Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Ready
phasers, load torpedoes. 
WORF: Phasers armed. Loading forward and aft torpedo bays. 
O'BRIEN: Sir, let me beam over. Try to talk to him. We served together
a long time. When you've been through what we have, you tend to get
inside someone. He might listen. 
RIKER: He'd never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board.

O'BRIEN: The Phoenix is using a high energy sensor system. It cycles
every five point five minutes. Between cycles there's a window of a
fiftieth of a second. Trust me, I can get through. 
PICARD: Make it so.

[Phoenix Ready room]

MAXWELL: Not now! 
(O'Brien enters and Maxwell grabs a phaser) 
O'BRIEN: I'm not armed. 
MAXWELL: How the devil did you get over here? 
O'BRIEN: I had the thought that if we could talk we could figure a way
out of this mess. 
MAXWELL: The way out of this is clear. Talk to Picard. Get him to board
the damned ship. 
O'BRIEN: He won't do that, sir. 
MAXWELL: But he'd turn his weapons on a Federation Starship to protect
the enemy? I don't believe it. 
O'BRIEN: He will. Count on it. 
MAXWELL: What the hell has happened to this war? 
O'BRIEN: Sir, there is no war. The war is over. 
MAXWELL: You're wrong. The Cardassians live to make war. 
O'BRIEN: That's what everybody thinks about the enemy. That's probably
what they think about us. 
MAXWELL: We're not the same at all. We do not start wars. We do not
make surprise attacks on manned outposts. We do not butcher women and
children in their homes. Children who never got the chance to grow up.
You were with me on Setlick. You saw what they did. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. 
MAXWELL: What was the name of the fellow who always hung around you
like a puppy? 
O'BRIEN: Will Kayden. Stompie. 
MAXWELL: Stompie. As cool under fire as a mountain lake. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. 
MAXWELL: He died at Setlick, didn't he? 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. 
MAXWELL: What was that song of his? The one he always sang, the one I
liked? 
O'BRIEN: (sings) The minstrel boy to the war has gone. In the ranks of
death you will find him. 
BOTH: His father's sword he hath girded on and his wild harp slung
behind him. Land of song, said the warrior bard, tho' all the world
betrays thee. One sword at least thy rights shall guard. 
O'BRIEN: One faithful harp shall praise thee. 
MAXWELL: I'm not going to win this one, am I. Chief? 
O'BRIEN: No, sir. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Captain Maxwell has
turned his ship over to his First Officer and transported aboard the
Enterprise. I have confined him to quarters for the return voyage.
