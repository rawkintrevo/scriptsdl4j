RIKER WORF PICARD KALIN COMPUTER LATHAL CRUSHER LEKA

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: White count is elevated. It's getting
higher and higher every time I read it. Are you in pain? 
RIKER: Not much. 
PICARD: Ambassador, we can stall the representatives. 
RIKER: They would see that as deception. I must meet with them. 
PICARD: But surely, to present yourself in this condition is not going
to help our cause. 
RIKER: I promise you, Captain, they will never know that I am ill. 
WORF: Captain, the emissaries. 
LEKA: May I present Kalin Trose of Alpha Moon, and Lathal Bine of Beta
Moon. 
KALIN: Thank you for receiving us, Captain. 
LATHAL: Is this Ambassador Odan? 
RIKER: Lathal Bine. It was your aunt who represented Beta thirty years
ago. 
LATHAL: That is correct. 
RIKER: She was a formidable woman. I had the utmost respect for her. 
KALIN: And who was it who spoke for Alpha so long ago? 
RIKER: That was you, of course, Kalin Trose. Then you were a young man,
bristling with passion and zeal, yet wise enough to understand that
your people needed peace to ensure their future. 
KALIN: And how did you manage to achieve a compromise between that
young man and the iron willed woman of Beta Moon? 
RIKER: They agreed to trade places for a week, to understand each
other's situation with more informed eyes. After that an agreement came
swiftly. 
KALIN: Nothing that you have said is beyond what a school child could
learn in a history book. 
RIKER: What is not commonly known that during those negotiations, you,
Kalin Trose, quelled a plot by a radical from your moon who was
attempting to assassinate the Beta delegate. 
KALIN: It is true. 
LATHAL: Perhaps he was wiser in his youth than he is now. Odan, you
must convince him to stop. 
RIKER: Will you accept me? Will you allow me to work with you? 
LATHAL: Yes. 
RIKER: And Alpha moon? 
KALIN: I will consider it, but I must consult others. 
LATHAL: This is a typical tactic. He is an obstructionist. You can see
that. 
RIKER: Kalin Trose, you may confer with your people, but we must have
your answer within eight hours. 
KALIN: You shall have it. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: His vital functions are overworked. His
immune system is under attack. I can only guess that he's suffering
from classic rejection syndrome. 
PICARD: Is there any treatment you can give him? 
CRUSHER: I can administer an immunosuppressant. That could help relieve
the symptoms but it Can't correct the underlying cause. There is a
foreign organism in his body. Medical school didn't exactly prepare me
for situations like this. 
PICARD: You're doing all you can. 
CRUSHER: Don't worry about me, Captain. I'm fine. 
PICARD: Ambassador, when you feel up to it, would you join me in my
Ready room? 
RIKER: Of course. 
(Picard leaves) 
CRUSHER: I'm giving you something that should help with the pain. At
least for a little while. 
RIKER: The pain's gone. Thank you. 
(he takes her arm) 
CRUSHER: Please don't. 
RIKER: Please let me touch you, just for a moment. 
(he leans in for a kiss) 
CRUSHER: No. Please.

[Ready room]

PICARD: It was a fast decision, which we must take
as positive. The Alphan representative has agreed, however reluctantly.
to let you mediate the dispute. 
RIKER: I knew they would. They are reasonable people, they're just
trapped in their own anger. 
PICARD: I have no doubt, however, that they will bolt if something goes
wrong in the discussion. 
RIKER: Then it's my job to see nothing goes wrong. Did I said something
wrong, Captain Picard? 
PICARD: No, it's just that for a moment you sounded more like Will
Riker. We have received information that the new host will arrive in
eighteen hours. Will you be all right until then? 
RIKER: The medication Doctor Beverly gave me has helped. I will find a
way to keep going. 
[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: Lemon tea.

[Odan's quarters]

RIKER: Computer, location of Doctor Beverly
Crusher. 
COMPUTER: Doctor Crusher is in her quarters. 
RIKER: Can you make balso tonic? 
COMPUTER: There is no formula on record. Please supply a molecular
structure. 
RIKER: Never mind. 
(Beverly stares at the red rose, then makes a decision) 
RIKER: Come in. 
CRUSHER: I thought I should see how you were doing. If you needed
another hypospray? 
RIKER: I don't think so. The symptoms haven't returned. 
CRUSHER: Oh. Well, that's good. 
RIKER: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Tomorrow's an important day. Do you feel ready for it? 
RIKER: I'll be fine. I've been preparing. 
CRUSHER: That's good. 
RIKER: Yes. 
CRUSHER: I'll check your vital signs in the morning before the
representatives get here. 
RIKER: I don't want them knowing I'm taking any medication. 
CRUSHER: Maybe you could schedule a series of breaks. 
RIKER: That's good. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
RIKER: Beverly, I want you. If you're going to leave, you'd better go
right now. 
CRUSHER: I'm not leaving.

Captain's log, stardate 44824.4. Governor Leka and
the representatives of the two moons are ready to transport on board.
We have learned that they each have troops massed and are ready for
combat if this final effort at peace is not successful.
