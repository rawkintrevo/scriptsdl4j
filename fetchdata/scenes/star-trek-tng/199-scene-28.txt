[Bridge]

RIKER: A complete sensor scan of the planet and
three survey probes turned up no surprises. No signs of life, nothing
out of the ordinary. 
WORF: Seven more unusual incidents have been reported. No casualties or
damage. 
DATA: We can only state that a subspace effect seems to exist within
this nebula. After I have made further analysis, I may be able to
adjust the ship's sensors to locate and identify the anomaly. 
RIKER: The ship is at risk as long as we're sitting here. We could
continue the investigation outside the nebula. 
PICARD: Agreed. Ensign McKnight, plot the most direct course, ahead
warp one. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, air. 
PICARD: Engage. 
DATA: Captain. 
(energy travels across science one) 
WORF: Captain! Explosive decompression on deck thirty seven. 
RIKER: Bridge to La Forge. Damage report.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're showing damage between decks. We
haven't localised it yet. 
(energy travels across a wall panel and throws a crewman to the floor) 
LAFORGE: Thorne, are you all right? 
THORNE: Yes, sir. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. A cryogenic control conduit just blew out
on us. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: I almost lost a man. 
PICARD: Ensign, full stop. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge 
PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. 
LAFORGE: I think we have some structural damage between decks thirty
six and thirty seven. I'd better go check it out.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: Van Mayter, you take access tube twenty
three M and look at the bridge connectors. Thorne, I'll cover the aft
section. You go down 
(Van Mayter, who had turned off down a corridor, screams. The men rush
back to see just her upper torso sticking out of the decking)

Captain's log, supplemental. This series of
unexplained events has now resulted in the death of a crewmember, but
it appears that Mister Data may have an explanation.
