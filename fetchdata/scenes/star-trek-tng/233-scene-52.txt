(at a science station) 
RIKER: Computer, release command control this station. Authorisation,
Riker Omega three. 
COMPUTER: Command functions restored. 
RIKER: Okay, Morta. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by
three primary main processing cores, cross-linked with a redundant
melacortz ramistat. fourteen kiloquad interface modules. The core
element is based on an FTL nanoprocessor with twenty five bilateral
kelilactirals, with twenty of those being slaved into the primary
heisenfram terminal. Now you do know what a bilateral kelilactiral is? 
MORTA: Well, of course I do, human. I am not stupid. 
RIKER: No, of course not. This is the isopalavial interface which
controls the main firomactal drive unit. Don't touch that. You'll blow
up the entire firomactal drive. 
MORTA: What? Wait. What is a firomactal drive? Just explain it to me. 
RIKER: That is the firomactal drive unit. It controls the ramistat core
and also keeps the ontarian manifold at forty thousand KRGs. 
(and with his other hand he puts sneaky commands into the computer) 
RIKER: The firomactal drive is powered by

PICARD JR: Command lockout has been released.
Accessing transporter. Weapons deactivation
programme is in place. Transporter security field standing by. We're
ready.

(Alexander's toy has been equipped with a comm.
badge. When it bumps into the Ferengi this time, he and his weapon are
beamed away to another transporter pad with a working forcefield)

RO JR: Tag! 
GUINAN JR: You're it! 
(they put comm. badges on the backs of the Ferengis and they go to join
their colleague)

[Corridor]

BERIK: Yes? 
ALEXANDER: I found this in the school room. Is it yours? 
(the comm. badge is activated as he hands it over. Bye, bye, Berik.)

(Keiko hypos a Ferengi into unconsciousness)

(Picard leaves the schoolroom) 
PICARD JR: That's all of them except for the two on the Bridge. Wait
here until I return. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: So, one more time. The ramistat kiloquad
capacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio times
the sum of the plasma injector quotient. 
(Picard enters, distracting Morta. Riker knocks him out)
