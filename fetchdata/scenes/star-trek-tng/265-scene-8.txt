NIKOLAI: Look.

NIKOLAI: I started thinking about this days ago
when it became clear the planet was doomed. I knew if I could get
access to your ship's computer, I could generate a replica of the
caves. The hard part was transporting the Boraalans into the holodeck
without anybody on the Enterprise noticing. But I was able to blank out
the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmonic
bursts. And it worked, perfectly. The Boraalans were transported while
they were sleeping. They never knew anything had happened.
