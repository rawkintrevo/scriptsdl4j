TROI OBRIEN WORF PICARD TAM DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Picard to Tam Elbrun. 
TAM [OC]: Captain? 
PICARD: Report to transporter room six immediately. 
TROI: Captain, I don't 
PICARD: Commander Data will meet you there. 
TAM [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Counsellor, we no longer have a choice.

[Gomtuu corridor]

(not so much a corridor as an artery with no blood)

TAM: No. No. Too much. Too much. 
DATA: Tam? 
TAM: I can't. 
DATA: Data to Enterprise. Enterprise, come in. 
TAM: No, don't. 
DATA: If it is harming you, we must return. Enterprise, respond. 
TAM: It's all right. It's all right now. Gomtuu was trying to
communicate a lifetime of experiences to me in a few seconds, but I'm
all right now.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: O'Brien to Bridge.
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: I lost the transporter lock on them. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN [OC]: Some kind of force field went up. 
WORF: Confirmed. The alien has thrown up a shield. It is blocking all
our sensors. Captain, the Romulans' weapons systems are now at full
power. 
PICARD: Follow them in, Mister Crusher. Red Alert. Mister Worf, arm
photon torpedoes.
WORF: Aye, sir.
