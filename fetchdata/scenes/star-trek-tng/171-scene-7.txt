tank ll yeah free crew featured celsius supposed report

[Conference room]

WESLEY: The temperature in the tank is now one
hundred fifty degrees Celsius. 
LAFORGE: Okay, lock it off. 
WESLEY: Is that it? Can I get out of here now? 
LAFORGE: What's your hurry? You don't really think something's going to
happen with Suzanne Dumont, do you? 
WESLEY: At least I'm not spending the night with a good book like some
people. 
LAFORGE: What's that supposed to mean? 
WESLEY: Just what it sounds like. 
LAFORGE: Let me tell you something. You'd get more action out of a good
book than you'll ever see on this date, I'll guarantee it. She's not
going to waste her time on someone like you. 
WESLEY: Someone like me? 
LAFORGE: She's way out of your league. 
WESLEY: Since when did you become an expert on women? 
LAFORGE: Compared to you, every male on this ship is an expert on
women. 
WESLEY: Well at least I don't have to find my women on the holodeck! 
LAFORGE: What did you say? 
WESLEY: You heard me! 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I heard you. Just what do you think is going to stop 
RIKER: Something wrong? I asked a question. 
LAFORGE: No, sir. Nothing wrong here. 
WESLEY: May I be excused, Commander? 
(Wesley storms out) 
RIKER: Anything you'd like to talk about, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: No, sir.

[Ship's theatre] 
(The band is tuning up, and the audience is
arriving) 
PICARD: I noticed that Lieutenant Worf put Ensign D'Amato on report for
insubordination. 
RIKER: D'Amato's been an exemplary officer. 
PICARD: Indeed he has. Would you look into it, Number One. 
RIKER: Of course. 
(Picard sits next to Beverly) 
PICARD: Good evening. 
CRUSHER: Good evening. 
PICARD: I assume the work is progressing on the conference room? 
RIKER: Yes, I checked in with Wesley and Geordi a few hours ago. There
was a moment when I actually thought that the two of them were going to
hit one each other. 
(Sarek and his party arrive. Everyone stands) 
PICARD: Ambassador Sarek, Perrin, on behalf of the entire crew,
welcome. 
SAREK: It was my wife's suggestion that we attend. It seemed an ideal
diversion. Perrin can be quite logical, when she so chooses. 
MENDROSSEN: It seems that the Ambassador had more free time than I
anticipated. 
PICARD: Commander Data will be our featured soloist this evening. 
DATA: I have been programmed to reproduce the individual musical styles
of over three hundred concert violinists, including Heifetz, Menuhin,
Grak-tay and Tataglia. Do you have a preference? 
PERRIN: Tataglia would be lovely. 
DATA: I hope you find the performance pleasing. 
PERRIN: I look forward to it. 
PICARD: At your convenience, Mister Data. Please. 
(The Ambassador's party sit in front of Picard. The lights dim and the
string quartet plays. Later, they get to sad, emotional piece. Deanna
notices Sakkath watching Sarek intently. A single tear rolls down
Sarek's cheek. Perrin gently wipes it away, and the party leave
quietly)
