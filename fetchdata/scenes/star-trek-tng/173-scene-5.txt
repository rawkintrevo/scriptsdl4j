[Sickbay - intensive care]

GUEST3: I am alive? 
CRUSHER: You certainly are. 
GUEST3: Thank you for my life. Tell me, who am I?

Captain's log, stardate 43960.6. Our mission to map
the Zeta Gelis star cluster is proceeding on schedule. Meanwhile,
Doctor Crusher reports that the recovery of the patient she has named
John Doe continues at a remarkable pace.

[Sickbay - room four]

(John is receiving laser therapy for his arms) 
CRUSHER: Are you experiencing any discomfort? 
GUEST3: None. I can feel the life returning to my body. 
CRUSHER: Your neurofibre waves are functioning almost normally again.
That puts you about six weeks ahead of my original schedule. 
GUEST3: That should give you and your colleagues something to talk about.

CRUSHER: You are all we've talked about since your arrival. 
GUEST3: I believe I'm ready for the next phase of my treatment. 
CRUSHER: You are right. It is time you stopped taking up valuable bed
space. Now these motor-assist bands will provide you with electrical
stimulation for your arms and legs. They will help you re-learn how to
control your muscles again. But remember, you've been off your feet for
almost a month, so don't be disappointed if at first your mobility is
restricted. Your limbs are still weak. 
GUEST3: I appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I think I may surprise you
again. I feel strong enough to fly. 
(He stands, takes one step forward and gently folds into Crushers arms)

CRUSHER: Whoops. 
GUEST3: Perhaps I should concentrate on walking first. 
CRUSHER: Let's try again, a little more slowly this time. 
GUEST3: Much more slowly. 
(He totters around the room as Picard enters, then falls over again as
he reaches them. Picard catches him this time) 
GUEST3: I envy your reflexes, Captain. 
PICARD: I envy your strength of will. Doctor Crusher has been keeping
me informed of your progress. It's quite extraordinary. 
GUEST3: I have an extraordinary doctor. She gave me back my life. I hope
that I am worthy of her efforts. 
PICARD: Are you still unable to recall anything about your past? 
GUEST3: Unfortunately, Captain, my memories begin the moment I woke up in
Sickbay. Doctor Crusher told me you think I was in some kind of battle.
PICARD: I'm quite sure of that. Have you any idea how you came to be in
that escape pod, or what happened to the ship? 
GUEST3: No. Believe me, Captain, it's a horrible feeling not knowing who
you are or where you're from. 
PICARD: Have you tried synaptic induction? 
CRUSHER: His neural nets don't conform to any known patterns.
Conventional neurotherapy has proven ineffective. Hopefully,
in time, his memory pathways will reestablish themselves naturally. 
(John winces) 
CRUSHER: That same pain? 
GUEST3: Yes. I think I've made enough progress for one day. 
PICARD: Not a relapse I hope. 
CRUSHER: This is nothing to do with his previous wounds. I think this
has something to do with the continuing mutation of his cell structure.

PICARD: You still have no theory as to what's causing it? 
CRUSHER: It doesn't make any sense. 
GUEST3: I seem to be a mystery, Doctor. To you and to myself.
