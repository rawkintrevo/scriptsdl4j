RIKER LAFORGE PICARD PERRIN MENDROSSEN TROI SAREK WESLEY SAKKATH

[Conference room]

(There's a huge swimming pool filled with pink
frothy gunk in the room) 
WESLEY: Are the Legarans really going to sit in this stuff? 
LAFORGE: Well, I'm sure not. 
WESLEY: Can you believe this smell? 
LAFORGE: What smell? What can I say? To us it's a slime pit, but to
them it's home. 
WESLEY: Okay, the environmental controls are ready. What's next? 
LAFORGE: What, are you in some kind of hurry or something? 
WESLEY: Yeah, I have a date. 
LAFORGE: A date? With who? 
WESLEY: Ensign Dumont. 
LAFORGE: Really? She's very attractive. I've got to admit, Wes, I'm a
bit surprised. 
WESLEY: What, that she'd go out with me? 
LAFORGE: No, that you'd actually have the nerve to ask her. Way to go. 
(Sarek, Picard et al enter) 
SAREK: The room is not ready. 
PICARD: No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are 
SAREK: The Legarans are very sensitive in matters of protocol. You will
remove all the furniture from the room. The walls must be bare. 
MENDROSSEN: I'm sure everything will be set up according to our
specifications before the Legarans arrive. Isn't that right, Captain? 
PICARD: I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before the
conference begins. 
PERRIN: My husband and I have every confidence in you, Captain. 
SAREK: I have worked for ninety three years in preparation for this
meeting. It is vital that no detail be overlooked. 
SAKKATH: Perhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their
work, Ambassador. 
SAREK: That will be acceptable. These walls are too bright.

[Bridge]

RIKER: The way Mendrossen described him, I expected
to see a frail old man. 
PICARD: I hope I'm that frail when I'm two hundred and two years old.
But his aides did seem to be a little overprotective, didn't they? 
RIKER: From what I could see, the Ambassador doesn't need to be
protected from anything. 
PICARD: Well, we'll respect Mister Mendrossen's request and allow
Ambassador Sarek his privacy. I suppose they were foolish and vain, my
expectations of this voyage. Sharing his thoughts, memories, his unique
understanding of the history he's made. 
TROI: Does this mean you're going to cancel the concert this evening? 
PICARD: No, the concert will ahead as scheduled. But it's a pity that
the guest of honour will be absent. 
RIKER: For all we know, the Ambassador might enjoy an evening's
entertainment 
TROI: Why not ask his wife if she'd like to attend? 
PICARD: That's an excellent idea, Counsellor. You have the Bridge,
Number One.
