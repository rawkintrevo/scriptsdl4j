boy says office didn bear going want message important

[Crusher's office]

WESLEY: I don't understand, Mom. What kind of
message? 
CRUSHER: I don't know exactly. Your father made it a few weeks after
you were born. 
WESLEY: Why? 
CRUSHER: He felt it was important to say certain things. And to make
sure that he didn't forget to tell you later. 
WESLEY: Do you know what it says? 
CRUSHER: No. But he wanted you to have this when you turned eighteen.
And I want you to have it, too.

[Worf's quarters]

WORF: Enter. 
SERGEY: Are we disturbing you? 
WORF: No. No. I thought you were going to your quarters to sleep. 
HELENA: We just came by to tuck you in. 
WORF: Please. When I heard you were on the visitors' list, I was not
sure I wanted you to come. I am glad you are here. 
HELENA: We had to come. 
SERGEY: Our boy was in trouble. After we read your letter about the
discommendation from the Klingons. 
HELENA: We don't exactly understand it all. 
SERGEY: We don't have to. We know what kind of man you are. 
HELENA: Whatever you did, we know it was for a good reason. 
WORF: I must bear my dishonour alone. 
SERGEY: That is not true. 
HELENA: I'm sorry if this is too human of us but, whenever you are
suffering, you must remember we are with you. 
SERGEY: And that we're proud of you, and that we love you. 
HELENA: You're our son.
