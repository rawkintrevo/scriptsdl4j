[Guest quarters]

RIKER [OC]: Counsellor Troi, please have Riva
report to the Bridge. 
TROI: They need you on the Bridge, now.

[Bridge]

(Troi, Riva and the whole Chorus enter) 
PICARD: The cease fire has been broken. 
SCHOLAR: I'm sure I can resolve that. Put them on the viewscreen. 
PICARD: Viewer on. 
WORF: The quality of the transmission is very poor. 
SCHOLAR: It is sufficient. 
ADONIS: Brothers. Your bravery as fighters is known. Now you must
demonstrate courage in a new way. Cease hostilities. Allow us to meet. 
WORF: The laser fire has ceased. 
RIKER: For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates for
peace. 
SCHOLAR: I will need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area
in order to pick a site for the meetings. Then I will need your help in
creating the proper setting. 
RIKER: Worf, prepare your security team. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
ADONIS: That's not necessary. 
RIKER: But it is prudent. 
ADONIS: I prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement. We do
not want to add to an already tense situation. 
PICARD: If that is your judgement, so be it. We are here to provide
whatever service you require. 
ADONIS: Thank you, Captain. 
(At an aft station, looking at a map) 
SCHOLAR: There. beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to
join us. The time for killing is come to an end.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Phasers on stun, Mister Worf. 
SCHOLAR: You won't need those. 
RIKER: I'm sure we won't. Energise. 
(O'Brien beams the six away) 
[Hilltop]

(A flat area with the top of the mountain forming a
back wall. It's windy and desolate.)
SCHOLAR: Yes, this will do. It is important that we set this up
properly. Commander. If it be possible, I would like torches here and
here. 
RIKER: Engineering. 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: This is the away team. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: We are going to need your help. 
LAFORGE: I thought you might.
