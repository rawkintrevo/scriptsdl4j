RIKER OBRIEN WORF PICARD MENDON DATA KARGAN

[Bridge]

WORF: We have a Klingon vessel approaching. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Open. They are returning our hail in proper language. It is the
Pagh. 
PICARD: On viewscreen. I'm Captain Picard of the Enterprise. 
KARGAN [on viewscreen]: This is Captain Kargan of the Klingon vessel,
the Pagh. Beam your First Officer on board immediately. 
PICARD: We are preparing to do so. And, Captain, you're getting a fine
officer. 
KARGAN: Thank you for your opinion, but I will judge that for myself.
Screen off. 
MENDON: Not very hospitable, are they? 
WORF: That is not your concern. Observe your station, Ensign Mendon. 
MENDON: Didn't mean to offend you. 
WORF: You didn't. Yet. 
(Mendon's duty station has a scan of the Pagh. The computer has
detected something on the hull. Mendon puts in a command - Request
substance analysis. Answer - inconclusive. Category - Microbiotic
colony. Bacterial colony. Subatomic. Life form analysis - inconclusive)

PICARD: Transporter, prepare to beam Commander Riker aboard the Pagh. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Acknowledged, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Good luck, Commander. 
RIKER: Thanks, O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN: I wouldn't want to go. 
RIKER: Why? 
O'BRIEN: You're not afraid, are you. 
RIKER: No, I'm not. 
O'BRIEN: I would be. Ready, sir. 
RIKER: Thanks. Energise.
