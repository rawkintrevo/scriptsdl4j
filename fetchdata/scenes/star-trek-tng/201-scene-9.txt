coordinates, Captain. 
DATA: All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. 
HOBSON: Starboard power coupling has overloaded. We've got a radiation
leak on decks ten through twelve. 
DATA: Why are the backups not functioning?

DATA: Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a course
of action without consulting the commanding officer.

but you're right. Belay those orders, everyone.
Phasers and torpedoes are back online. What should we do, sir? 
DATA: You will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and begin
repairs of the starboard power coupling. 
HOBSON: Thank you, sir. You heard the Captain, everyone.
