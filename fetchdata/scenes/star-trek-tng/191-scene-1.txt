RIKER WORF PICARD TROI CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

(transcriber's note - the view of the ships hull
after the credits, and the subtitles, clearly say Brittain, but some
okudagrams say Brattain. Take your pick) 
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. 
RIKER: That's the Brittain, all right. 
DATA: The ship is intact, sir, with no indication of structural damage.

RIKER: Engines? 
DATA: All propulsion systems are shut down. The ship is drifting, sir. 
PICARD: Life form readings? 
DATA: Inconclusive. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: There is life on board, but 
PICARD: What is it? 
TROI: I don't know. Something (she shrugs) 
PICARD: Number One, assemble your team. 
RIKER: Doctor Crusher, report to Transporter room three. Worf. Data. 
TROI: Commander, I need to come too.

 [Brittain Bridge]

DATA: There is no malfunction in any of the main
systems, sir. 
(Riker finds the captain dead in her chair, something impaling her
through the chest) 
WORF: Commander. Here's another one. This was done by a phaser on a
setting of six or seven. 
RIKER: And more over here. 
CRUSHER: The entire Bridge crew. 
RIKER: Whoever did this could still be on the ship. 
TROI: There is someone alive, but he didn't kill these people. Here. 
(a door opens) 
TROI: I think he's Betazoid. It's all right. We're going to help you.
Who did this? Who did this to you?
