[Pulaski's office]

DATA: Doctor Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. 
PULASKI: Hello, Sarjenka. 
SARJENKA: Hello. 
(She picks up a brown and white stone from the desk) 
SARJENKA: What is this? 
PULASKI: An Elanin singer stone. It sings a different song for each

SARJENKA: What does it sing for you? 
DATA: It does not sing for me. 
SARJENKA: Why not? 
DATA: Because I am a machine. 
PULASKI: Sarjenka, we're going to run a few scans just to be sure
you're all right. Data's will be right here. Don't worry.
