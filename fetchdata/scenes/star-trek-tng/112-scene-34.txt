JAMESON PICARD TROI CRUSHER RIKER

[Sickbay]

TROI: Requests your presence in Sickbay
immediately, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I'm on my way.

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: What is it, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I think you'd better see for yourself, Captain. 
(Jameson is on a bed, very ill) 
JAMESON: Picard. Picard, I have to get to Karnas. 
CRUSHER: I can't allow him out of my care, Captain. 
JAMESON: It's my last option, Picard. The raid failed. All I have left
to bargain with is myself. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Picard. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
RIKER [OC]: A new message from Karnas, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes,
one of the hostages will be executed. 
[Sickbay]

RIKER [OC]: Fifteen minutes after that, another.

[Bridge]

RIKER: He promises the method of execution will be
most painful. 
[Sickbay]

JAMESON: Let me go. If I give myself over to him,
he'll let the hostages go. It's me he wants. 
PICARD: It means almost certain death for you, Admiral. 
JAMESON: My life for how many hostages, Picard? Twenty? Let me go. 
PICARD: Number One, inform Karnas we'll be beaming down in less than
five minutes. 
RIKER [OC]: Did you say we, sir? 
PICARD: You have your orders, Number One. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
