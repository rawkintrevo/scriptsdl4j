[Gymnasium]

(Worf is leading a Klingon Tai-chi class, including
Troi and Alkar) 
WORF: That will be all for today. There will be another class tomorrow
at oh seven hundred hours.
TROI: The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined.
ALKAR: I believe in a strong connection between body and mind. You
obviously share the same convictions.
TROI: Yes, I do. Only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to my
mind's wishes.

[Corridor]

TROI: I would imagine that your self-discipline
helps you in your work.
ALKAR: I don't know about that. I think maybe my biggest asset is
patience. I let everybody else talk until they're exhausted, and when I
start, they're too tired to argue.
TROI: You're going to need all your patience at Seronia. I can't
imagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other. 
ALKAR: Neither can I. I won't know that until I get there. I tend to
feel my way through a situation.

[Turbolift]

ALKAR: Deck nine. If I were empathic like you, I'd
have a real advantage.
TROI: I thought Lumerians were empathic.
ALKAR: Only with each other, not other species. So, I don't have any
idea what you might be feeling just now.
TROI: Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness,
serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that you
hope to draw out in others.
