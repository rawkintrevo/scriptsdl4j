[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is reading, when the door bell chimes, and
Beverly enters with her medical bag) 
CRUSHER: You sent for me, sir? 
PICARD: Yes, Doctor. Sit down. Look, this perhaps may be nothings, but
I've been feeling a bit odd of late. Fatigued. And now I've got this
damned headache. 
CRUSHER: A what? 
PICARD: Headache. Headache. Surely you know what a headache is. 
CRUSHER: Of course. But I don't often encounter them. 
PICARD: The reason is obvious, of course. What are the Ferengi up to?
Stand by, Enterprise. Stand by for what? 
CRUSHER: I don't see a thing wrong. 
PICARD: No, neither can I. Unless they're baiting some kind of trap. 
CRUSHER: With your head. I see nothing physically wrong, but I want to
run some additional scans in Sickbay. 
PICARD: Doctor, all I've got is 
CRUSHER: Is an order to report to Sickbay. From the one person aboard
this ship who can give you an order. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain from First Officer. They're finally sending a
message. 
PICARD: On my way, Number One. Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.
