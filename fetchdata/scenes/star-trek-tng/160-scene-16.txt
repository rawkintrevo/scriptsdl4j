[Side cave]

PICARD: Worf went down. I don't know if he's alive
or dead. And there were other casualties. 
CRUSHER: Was Wes on the Bridge? 
PICARD: Yes. He took cover. I didn't see any more than that. But you
all right though? 
CRUSHER: Yes, they needed a doctor. 
PICARD: The side effects of the transport? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
PICARD: We're getting closer to tracing their movements. Actually, it
was Wesley who put us onto this dimensional jump of theirs. He has been
extraordinary, Beverly. He's going to make a very fine officer. 
CRUSHER: He's had good role models. I'm sorry. If I'd only gone back to
the ship. 
PICARD: I should have beamed you up. 
CRUSHER: You wouldn't dare. 
PICARD: Oh yes I would, and should. 
CRUSHER: Without my permission? 
PICARD: If you don't follow orders. 
CRUSHER: If you'd give reasonable orders, I'd obey. 
PICARD: Doctor, I will be the judge of reasonable. 
CRUSHER: There aren't any exits to the surface. 
PICARD: So the only way out is by the transporter. Or the dimensional
jump. 
CRUSHER: A mode of travel I'd encourage you to avoid. It's killing
them. 
PICARD: They're mad. 
CRUSHER: I don't know any more. The difference between a madman and a
committed man willing to die for a cause. It's all become blurred over
the last few days. 
PICARD: Beverly, I don't have to remind you of the psychological impact
of being a hostage. 
CRUSHER: I know. I understand that. But their leader, Finn, he's not
what you'd expect. 
PICARD: No, he's certainly not what I would expect. Without cause or
reason, he and his little band of outlaws has attacked my ship!
CRUSHER: But he did have reasons. The medical supplies, the arrests.
Jean-Luc, if we really examined our role in all this 
PICARD: Beverly, you are arguing for a man who may have murdered your
son. 
FINN: I didn't kill your son, Beverly. We weren't able to destroy the
ship. We had to settle for him. She wouldn't even tell me her name. I
call her Doctor. 
PICARD: You have made a grave miscalculation. 
FINN: Oh? 
PICARD: You have assaulted a Federation starship, killed and wounded
several members of her crew, kidnapped two of her officers, and you
don't expect a response? 
FINN: On the contrary, I'm counting on it. 
PICARD: You want Federation involvement? 
FINN: Captain, the Federation has a lot to admire in it, but there's a
hint of moral cowardice in your dealings with non-aligned planets.
You're doing business with a government that is crushing us and you say
you're not involved. You're very, very much involved. You just don't
want to get dirty. 
PICARD: You accuse us of cowardice while you plant bombs in shadows? 
FINN: I am been fighting the only war that I can against an intractable
enemy. Now, I'm fighting a big war against a more powerful adversary.
Can't you see how that helps me? 
CRUSHER: I'm afraid I can't. 
PICARD: He's added another chair to the negotiating table. 
FINN: You added the chair, Captain. I am simply forcing you to sit in
it. The Federation will quickly tire of our little war. They'll want
you back. They will want to get as far away from Rutia as they can. And
I will not make it easy. Eventually, the Federation will force the
government into make concessions. And then a few more, and then a few
more. Until we can finally reach an honourable agreement that saves
face for all sides. Except we win. 
PICARD: You understand I will not cooperate with you in any way. 
FINN: You've already cooperated, Captain, just by coming here.
