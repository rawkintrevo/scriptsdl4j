TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER GREBNEDLOG WESLEY DATA REGINOD

[Shuttlecraft]

WESLEY: ETA thirteen thirty hours, sir. It's not
exactly warp speed. 
PICARD: More like a late twenty-second century interplanetary journey. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: You should read more history, Ensign. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Complete waste of time. 
WESLEY: Pardon? 
PICARD: I shouldn't be taking this trip at all. I should be back on
board the Enterprise. 
WESLEY: Why are you coming with me to Starbase Five One Five, sir? 
PICARD: Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign, I didn't
mean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damned
cardiac replacement. 
WESLEY: Cardiac replacement? I didn't know. 
PICARD: Well, now you do. 
WESLEY: A parthenogenetic implant? 
PICARD: What else would it be? My heart was injured and a replacement
was necessary. That would have been it, except that the replacement is
faulty. 
WESLEY: Why would anyone use a faulty replacement? 
PICARD: Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.

[Pakled ship]

(La Forge beams in and is immediately crowded by
four very big guys. Think Vogons without the green skin) 
LAFORGE: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, it's okay. I'm here to help. 
GREBNEDLOG: We are far from home. 
LAFORGE: Who's in charge of Engineering? 
GREBNEDLOG: My friend. His name is Reginod. 
LAFORGE: Think I could meet him? 
GREBNEDLOG: He is Reginod. 
LAFORGE: Yes, I think you mentioned that. 
REGINOD: We look for things. 
LAFORGE: So I've heard. 
GREBNEDLOG: Can you make our ship go? 
LAFORGE: Yes, I think so. 
GREBNEDLOG: We look for things to make us go. 
LAFORGE: Fellas, why don't you show me where your guidance system is,
okay? Excuse me.
REGINOD: He is smart.

[Bridge]

(The Bridge crew are watching everything on the
viewscreen) 
TROI: Commander? Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship? 
RIKER: Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks. 
DATA: How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine
curiosity. 
TROI: Commander. Those aliens. What they feel is not helplessness.
Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger, great danger. 
RIKER: Can you be more specific, Counsellor? 
TROI: It's not our help they want. 
RIKER: Well, our help is all they're going to get. They can't force us
into anything, can they? 
TROI: You think they're weak. 
RIKER: Look at them. They're certainly not Jarada or Romulans. 
DATA: Our Betazoid Counsellor is often aware of things beyond our
perceptive abilities.
