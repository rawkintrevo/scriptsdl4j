[Living room]

(a very old man and a young boy are crawling on the
floor) 
PICARD: Gotcha! Now I gotcha. 
MERIBOR: Some children are certainly making a lot of noise in here. 
PICARD: You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that.

MERIBOR: I'm wearing plenty of your skin protector. 
PICARD: How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protector
outdoors? You do? Good boy. 
BATAI JR: (now with his father's hairline) Happy day, everybody. It's
time to go see the launching. 
PICARD: What launching? What's he talking about? 
MERIBOR: They're sending up a missile, Father. We're going to watch it.

PICARD: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. 
BATAI JR: Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now. Let's go see the launching. 
(Batai puts a hat on his nephew and they leave) 
PICARD: It breaks my heart to look at him. 
MERIBOR: Who? 
PICARD: My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,
and he's not going to get one. 
MERIBOR: Please come, Father. 
PICARD: Why didn't I hear anything about a launching?

[Town square]

(everyone is in broad rimmed sunhats and loose
clothing) 
PICARD: Did everyone know about this except me? I'll be all right
sitting here. You go off with the others. Hold onto my grandson, and
watch the damned thing go up for all the good it'll do. What is it
they're launching? 
MERIBOR: You know about it, Father. You've already seen it. 
PICARD: Seen it? What are you talking about? I haven't seen any
missile. 
BATAI: Yes, you have, old friend. Don't you remember? 
PICARD: Batai? 
(Batai as the healthy middle-aged man we first met) 
BATAI: You saw it just before you came here. We hoped our probe would
encounter someone in the future. Someone who could be a teacher.
Someone who could tell the others about us. 
PICARD: Oh, it's me, isn't it? I'm the someone. I'm the one it finds.
That's what this launching is. A probe that finds me in the future. 
ELINE: Yes, my love. 
PICARD: Eline. 
ELINE: The rest of us have been gone for a thousand years. If you
remember what we were, and how we lived, then we'll have found life
again. 
PICARD: Eline. 
(a rocket soars into the cloudless blue sky) 
ELINE: Now we live in you. Tell them of us, my darling.

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: Something's happening. 
DATA: The nucleonic beam has ceased, Commander. The probe has shut
down. 
CRUSHER: His cerebral functions are stabilising. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, put a tractor beam on that probe. I want it in
shuttlebay two for examination. 
WORF: Yes, Commander. 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: Please, Captain, don't get up too quickly. 
PICARD: Captain? This is the Enterprise. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. How long?

RIKER: Twenty, twenty five minutes. 
PICARD: Twenty five minutes? 
CRUSHER: Captain, I want you in Sickbay. I'd like to run a full
diagnostic on you. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher. 
(he pauses at the turbolift to take a happy look around)
