PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge. 
RIKER: Geordi, can you give us enough power to get us out of here?

LAFORGE: Sorry, Commander, we haven't addressed
that one yet. First priority was to maintain the shields. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Acknowledged. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We'll get to work on it right away, Sir. 
PICARD: Pass my congratulations to the rest of your team.

LAFORGE: Thanks, Captain. We're all smiles down
here. 
(Except Leah is an immobile hologram awaiting a question)

DATA: Captain. We've been able to verify that these
coils are the logs of the Promellian captain, but most of them have
decayed and cannot be repaired. 
RIKER: Can you get any playback at all? 
DATA: On most, there are brief sections which may yield some
information. 
RIKER: Do the best you can, Data. Let's just hope we can get the
section we need. 
PICARD: Surely he must have logged the cause of the ship's death. What
captain wouldn't? 
RIKER: All found in an open locker? I don't think he was too concerned
with security.

LAFORGE: 452 through system L-575. 
COMPUTER: Adjustments to dilithium crystal chamber complete. 
LAFORGE: Impact analysis, computer. 
COMPUTER: Warp energy has increased fourteen percent. Reactants per
unit time remaining steady. 
LAFORGE: Yes! All right! Computer, do you have any, you know,
personality on file for Doctor Brahms? 
COMPUTER: Starfleet personality profile analysis, stardate 40056. 
LAFORGE: Did she ever debate at the intergalactic caucuses on Chaya
Seven? 
COMPUTER: Doctor Brahms attended Chaya Seven caucuses on the following
stardates 
LAFORGE: Never mind the dates. Computer, if you add data from all these
sources, could you synthesise a true representation
of Doctor Brahms? 
COMPUTER: There would be a nine point three seven percent margin of
error in the interactive responses from the facsimile. 
LAFORGE: I can live with that. Do it. (Leah takes a breath, then
smiles) Doctor Brahms? 
LEAH: Geordi, it's me, Leah. Don't start calling me Doctor Brahms or
I'll call you Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
LEAH: Now, we've managed to maintain energy but we can't leave it in
this realignment forever without burning out components, so we need to
move quickly. 
(Geordi's jaw is on the floor) 
LEAH: Are you with me? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!.
