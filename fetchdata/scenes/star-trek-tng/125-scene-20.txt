[Ante room]

AARON: Let's have some Andonian tea while we wait
for your Riker. Then you can tell us about what's brought you here. 
PICARD: I see you keep up with our duty roster. 
AARON: Yes, of course, Captain. The Enterprise is very important to us.

REMMICK: Excuse me, gentlemen. 
(Remmick leaves) 
AARON: To the Horatio, gentlemen. 
SAVAR: The Horatio. 
(Picard does not drink) 
AARON: What an awful tragedy. Such a terrible loss of life. 
PICARD: It's interesting that you should mention the Horatio. It's one
of the subjects I wanted to discuss. 
AARON: Really? 
PICARD: Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? 
SAVAR: Absolutely. Implosion, due to extreme negligence on the part of
her Captain. 
AARON: Enjoy, Picard. I believe you'll find it an excellent aperitif.

[Guest quarters]

(Worf and La Forge rush in) 
QUINN: It's good thing you're here. He slipped and hit his head. 
LAFORGE: This is Lieutenant La Forge in guest quarter seventeen. We
have a medical emergency. 
QUINN: Your Doctor Crusher is most capable. I'm sure he'll be all
right. Now if you'll excuse me, my time here is most limited. 
LAFORGE: Admiral. Don't you think we should wait until the Doctor gets
here? 
(Quinn throws him through the plywood doors into the corridor) 
QUINN: Now, Klingon, it's between you and me. 
(Worf's double handed blows have no effect. Quinn floors him easily) 
QUINN: Do Klingons fear death as much as humans? I could snap your neck
in a second, but it wouldn't be as much fun. 
(Three sustained bursts from Beverly's phaser finally put Quinn down) 
WORF: Are you all right? 
LAFORGE: If I could see, I'd be seeing stars. 
WORF: What is he? 
CRUSHER: Let's find out.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Retinal scans are an exact match It really
is Quinn. 
LAFORGE: How can that be? The man picked me up like a rag doll. 
CRUSHER: I'm going to have to do a complete internal scan. 
LAFORGE: Keep me posted, Doctor, I'll be on the Bridge. 
(She spots something at the back of Quinn's neck) 
CRUSHER: What is that? 
(A pointed something sticking out, wiggling)
