[Picard's quarters]

(Picard has dug out his Ressikan flute) 
PICARD: Computer, stop playback. Change the clarinet to an oboe.
Continue recording. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. 
(Data and La Forge enter) 
PICARD: Yes, gentlemen? 
LAFORGE: Captain we'd like your permission to take the Engineering
computer offline for a couple of hours. We're working on a new
interface that would allow Data to act as an emergency backup in the
event of a ship-wide systems failure. 
DATA: In theory, my neural network should be able to sustain key
systems until primary control is restored. 
PICARD: It sounds like an intriguing experiment. I'll be interested to
see the results. Permission granted. 
LAFORGE: It's possible we may even be able to run secondary systems
through Data. Weapons control, sensor arrays. 
PICARD: Yes, I get the idea, Mister La Forge. Thank you. Please
proceed. 
(Data and La Forge leave) 
PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Come. 
(Beverly enters) 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I need to talk to you about Something for Breakfast.

PICARD: Breakfast? 
CRUSHER: The play. 
PICARD: Ah, yes. Well, it's a very intriguing drama, but I really don't
have the time it would take to learn a part. And anyway, I'm not much
of an actor. 
CRUSHER: That's no problem. 
PICARD: Oh? 
CRUSHER: Well, you wouldn't be playing one of the leads. 
PICARD: Oh. 
CRUSHER: It's a very small part. Only two lines. 
PICARD: Really. 
CRUSHER: You play the butler. 
PICARD: Well, I'll think about it and let you know. 
CRUSHER: You would be wonderful, Jean-Luc. We're rehearsing today at
one thirty. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PICARD: Computer, begin playback from the first measure. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Computer, pause recording. Yes? 
(Worf enters) 
WORF: Captain, I am sorry to interrupt. 
PICARD: No, please, Mister Worf, come in. 
WORF: I was hoping to take advantage of the Biko's delay by staging
shipwide security drills. I have planned a tentative schedule. 
PICARD: Oh yes, this is very impressive, Mister Worf. But we'll be
taking on new personnel at Starbase one eighteen in a few weeks. Surely
the drills can wait until then. 
WORF: In that case, I will use the time to perform maintenance checks
on the forward phaser array. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, is there some reason why you're trying to give
yourself more work? 
WORF: No, sir. I simply wish to use the extra time 
PICARD: Enjoy yourself. You have the free time. Use it. 
WORF: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. 
(Worf leaves) 
PICARD: Computer, continue recording and playback once more. From the
top.
