CRUSHER: Dalen, I'm sorry to hear about Patricia. 
QUAICE: She'd been ill for some time. 
CRUSHER: Is her death the reason you're giving up your post here? 
QUAICE: We had a lifetime together, doing all the things we'd ever
dreamed, and more. But when she was gone, I couldn't continue to work
in that office, sleep in that bed without her. The absence of her was
too distracting. I'm not sure that I'm making any sense. 
CRUSHER: Jack and I didn't have a lifetime together, only a few short
years, but I understand. When you realise someone you love is lost
forever 
QUAICE: You know what the worst part of growing old is? So many of the
people you've known all your life are gone and you realise you didn't
take the time to appreciate them while you still could. Oh, I'm sorry.
There was no reason to heap all this emotional baggage on you. I
usually travel light.

LAFORGE: Wes, time for the experiment is over. I
want my warp engines back now. 
WESLEY: Almost done, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Almost isn't good enough. You want to be the one to explain
when the Captain says 'Engage' and we just sit here? 
WESLEY: I just need a couple more minutes. I'm ready to try the new
warp field. Mom? 
CRUSHER: Don't let me interrupt. 
LAFORGE: Wesley! 
WESLEY: Right! Okay! 
(There's a sudden flash. Wesley looks concerned.) 
LAFORGE: Computer, level two diagnostic on warp drive systems. 
COMPUTER: Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal
parameters. 
LAFORGE: Wesley, talk to me. 
WESLEY: That shouldn't have happened. Why would there be any visible
phenomena outside the drive? 
RIKER [OC]: Prepare for umbilical disconnect. 
LAFORGE: Are you done? 
WESLEY: Yeah. Mom? 
(But she's not there) 
RIKER [OC]: Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters. 
LAFORGE: Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power to the helm.
