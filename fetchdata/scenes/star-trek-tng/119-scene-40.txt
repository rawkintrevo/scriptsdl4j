[Classroom]

(The dynamics relationships test is on the screens,
and there are a lot of beeps going on) 
MORDOCK: I can't get it. 
WESLEY: Yes, you can. Don't fight it. Relax into it and let it come by
itself. 
MORDOCK: No, it's going too fast. Wesley, I can't do it. 
(Wesley turns from his own screen to look at Mordock's) 
WESLEY: Yes you can. You've got your rotation factor. Just put in your
vector coordinates. 
(Mordock finishes first, Wesley second. The Vulcan finished too.) 
COMPUTER: Time elapsed. 
(Chang enters.) 
CHANG: Congratulations, Mordock. That was the second fastest time ever
recorded on this test. You all did well. 
MORDOCK: No, it should not have been that way. Mister Crusher helped
me. 
CHANG: Yes. I know. An interesting choice, Mister Crusher. Especially
considering how close you and Mister Mordock are in overall score. You
all have an hour to prepare for your last test. 
WESLEY: The psych test, sir? 
CHANG: We prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on
reactions to various individual problems, but psych test will do.

[Admiral's Quarters]

(Remmick enters) 
REMMICK: Sir? 
QUINN: Please sit down, Mister Remmick. Proceed with your report. 
REMMICK: Admiral, I've done my best to be thorough during this
investigation. 
QUINN: Continue. 
REMMICK: I couldn't find what you asked, sir. I spoke to officer after
officer, at length. I pried into the ships log reports. And yet I could
find nothing wrong. Except, perhaps, a casual familiarity among the
Bridge crew, but mostly that comes from a sense of teamwork, and the
feeling of family. I'm sorry, sir. I did my best. 
QUINN: Quite. You're dismissed, Commander. 
REMMICK: Yes, sir. Captain Picard, my tour in the Inspector General's
office will be up in six months. When I'm finished, this is where I'd
like to serve, sir. 
(No reply, and Remmick leaves) 
QUINN: Don't judge the young man too harshly. He's a good officer. 
PICARD: It's not him I'm inclined to judge. 
QUINN: Don't judge me too harshly either, until I've finished. We had
to be very sure of you. Some of us at Starfleet Command became
suspicious of certain problems in the Federation. 
PICARD: What kind of problems? 
QUINN: Something or someone is trying to destroy the fabric of
everything we've built up in the last two hundred years. 
PICARD: What's your evidence? 
QUINN: I can't go into that. There are too many people involved. 
PICARD: What do you want from me? 
QUINN: I don't know whether the threat comes from the inside or whether
it's from outside. I need people I can trust in strong positions
throughout the Federation. 
PICARD: You have my complete support. You know that. 
QUINN: That's not enough. I want to promote you to Admiral, and I want
you to take over as Commandant of Starfleet Academy. 
PICARD: The Academy. 
QUINN: Yes. 
PICARD: The Academy? 
QUINN: I need you close. 
PICARD: Then there was never a problem with the Enterprise. 
QUINN: No, but I had to be sure you hadn't been co-opted. 
PICARD: Greg, this is politics, and I'm not good at politics. Surely
there are others who are better suited. 
QUINN: All right. Even if I am wrong, and I hope I am, you're still the
best man for the job. 
PICARD: I appreciate the value of what you're offering. It's not a
decision I can make quickly. 
QUINN: I need an answer soon. 
PICARD: All right. You'll have it tonight, Admiral. Thank you.

[Relva 7 Corridor]

(Wesley is sitting nervously on a bench when Chang
comes out of a room) 
CHANG: Mister Mordock will be finished with his psych test momentarily.

(The door to room 101 opens, Mordock is shaking) 
WESLEY: Mordock? Are you all right? 
MORDOCK: I will be. 
CHANG: Mister Crusher. You're next. Good luck.

[Room 101]

(A small room with bare walls and a single chair in
the middle) 
WESLEY: I'm here. I'm ready. (nothing) Maybe they forgot. Breathe. Got
to remember to breathe. 
(The sound of an explosion outside. Wesley goes to investigate)

[Corridor]

(There's a series of bangs, and the sound of a
voice calling out) 
COMPUTER: Evacuate immediately. Sixty five seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Somebody help! There's something's wrong in the Environmental
lab! 
MAN [OC]: Help! 
(Wesley opens the door)

[Environmental Maintenance Laboratory]

(There's steam from ruptured pipes) 
MAN: Help! We're trapped. I can't move. Please, help me. 
(Wesley sees him pinned under a piece of pipe) 
MAN: We're going to die in here! 
(There's a second man cowering in the corner) 
MAN: The liquid hydrogen's going to blow! The shut off valve ruptured.
Hurry up! My legs are crushed. You've got to help me! 
(Wesley goes to lift the debris, and calls to the uninjured man in the
corner) 
WESLEY: Give me a hand with this! 
MAN 2: We're going to die! 
WESLEY: Help me! 
MAN 2: I can't! It's too late! 
COMPUTER: Thirty seconds to seal off. 
(Wesley gets the pipe off the injured man) 
WESLEY: Come on! 
MAN: If we don't get out of here fast, they'll seal us in to contain
the explosion. 
WESLEY: (dragging the casualty) Come on, you're not hurt. 
MAN 2: I can't go through that! 
WESLEY: Yes, you can. You've got to. 
COMPUTER: Twenty seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Come on! I can't carry you both! You're not hurt. 
COMPUTER: Ten seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Come on! 
MAN 2: It's too late. 
(The doors are closing as Wesley drags the casualty out) 
WESLEY: I'm sorry.

[Relva 7 Corridor]

WESLEY: Officer Chang! There's 
CHANG: Wesley! It's all right. 
(The casualty gets to his feet, dusts himself off and shakes Wesley's
hand) 
MAN: Thanks. 
CHANG: An excellent performance, Mister Crusher. 
(The other man walks out of the lab and leaves) 
WESLEY: Performance? That was the test? 
CHANG: Yes. 
WESLEY: A man could have died. 
CHANG: Theoretically, yes. You had to make a choice. And you did.
There's no right or wrong about it. Your greatest fear has been that
you couldn't make that decision. 
WESLEY: Because of my father? Because Cap. Because someone made that
choice, and my father died.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: Yes, Number One? 
RIKER: Mister Remmick has left the ship. 
PICARD: Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. And you can
inform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed. 
RIKER: Thank you. They'll be pleased that. Can you explain now what he
was after? 
PICARD: They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over as
Commandant, Starfleet Academy. 
RIKER: Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir. You'll be able to
shape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet. You haven't decided
what you're going to do. 
PICARD: Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk.
