RIKER WORF HELENA PICARD ROBERT SERGEY GUINAN LOUIS MARIE

[Ten Forward]

(Sitting at the bar) 
SERGEY: It's a great crew, son, and they think the world of you. 
HELENA: They really do. 
WORF: Mother, Father, I wish you would be a little more reserved while
you are on board. 
HELENA: I know. We go too far, sometimes. 
SERGEY: We're just excited to be here. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Worf here. 
RIKER [OC]: I need to talk to you about the phaser test results. 
WORF: On my way, Commander. Have Guinan call me if you need anything. 
(Worf leaves, and Sergey and Helena get up, agitated and walk towards
the windows) 
SERGEY: Maybe we should just leave it alone. 
HELENA: I can't just leave it alone. I'm his mother. 
GUINAN: You know, sooner or later, everyone comes in here. They stand
by those windows and they look out and the stare. They're looking for
that little star they call home. It doesn't matter how far away it is,
everybody looks anyway. I'm Guinan. Pleased to meet you. You're Worf's
parents? 
SERGEY: Sergey and Helena Rozhenko 
GUINAN: Welcome. Sit, please. There's something I would like to ask
you. 
HELENA: Please. 
GUINAN: How come you never gave him prune juice? 
HELENA: I beg your pardon? 
GUINAN: He said he'd never had it till he came here. Mow he can't get
enough of it. 
HELENA: Worf? 
SERGEY: He never wanted any human food while he was growing up.
Everything had to be Klingon. 
HELENA: I learned to cook rokeg blood pie. 
SERGEY: However, we never quite learned how to eat it. 
HELENA: It was a difficult adolescence. 
GUINAN: But you got through it. 
SERGEY: We didn't do anything special. 
GUINAN: Didn't you? Just look at him. I think he's pretty special. 
HELENA: We knew it wouldn't be easy for him, growing up without other
Klingons to go to for guidance. 
SERGEY: We had to let him discover and explore his heritage by himself,
let him find his own path. 
GUINAN: So many parents could learn so much from the two of you. 
HELENA: Well, I'm afraid that Worf feels that we do not understand him.

GUINAN: Well, part of him may feel that way, but there's another part
that I've seen. A part that comes in and drinks prune juice. A part
that looks out the window towards home. He's not looking toward the
Klingon Empire. He's looking toward you.

[Chez Picard]

(Picard is at a desk by the front window. According
to the computer screen, this Atlantis Project is to create a land mass
over the mid-Atlantic ridge.) 
MARIE: Jean Luc? Are you all right? 
PICARD: I seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery. Louis
mentioned the Atlantis project needed a director, and I found myself
actually thinking about it. 
MARIE: Why shouldn't you? 
PICARD: Leaving my career, the Enterprise? 
MARIE: Considering what you've just been through 
PICARD: No, it's not that. Or is it? 
MARIE: Besides, it would be wonderful to have you back home. Given a
little time, maybe you and your brother might even get to like one
another. 
PICARD: Well, I already like his choice in wives. I never thanked you
for your correspondence. It made me feel like part of the family. 
MARIE: You're not like part of the family. You are part of the family,
Jean Luc Picard. 
(The door bell has chimed) 
ROBERT: Don't worry, my dear, I've got it. 
LOUIS: Robert. 
MARIE: Louis, come in. Let me get you some wine. You can talk business.

ROBERT: Business? 
PICARD: Well, there's nothing much to talk about. 
LOUIS: I'm interested to know what you thought about our plans. 
PICARD: I've only had a chance to glance at them. I've a few ideas. 
LOUIS: Wonderful. We should discuss them with the board of governors.
I've set up a meeting. 
PICARD: Meeting? 
LOUIS: Just a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow morning? 
PICARD: Preliminary to what? 
LOUIS: They want you. I mentioned your interest in the project, that's
all. That's all I had to say. They jumped at the prospect. 
PICARD: I never said there was a prospect. 
LOUIS: At least listen to them, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: All right. Very good. Fine. I'll listen. 
LOUIS: You won't regret it, Jean-Luc. I promise you. I'll see you in
the morning.
