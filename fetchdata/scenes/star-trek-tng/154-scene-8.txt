RIKER: What is it, Wes? 
WESLEY: The main power returner is acting a little weird. 
RIKER: Define weird. 
WESLEY: I'm getting fluctuating waveguide readings. 
RIKER: Run a maintenance sweep. 
WESLEY: Right.

[Warship]

DATA: Activating power pack, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, be sure we get tricorder images of their tactical
display. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: The source of the distress signal appears to be coming from up
there, Captain. 
PICARD: Let's put an end to their last cry for help. 
DATA: Captain, I believe this is an information storage device. A crude
analogue of our isolinear optical chip. 
PICARD: Crude by our standards today, Data. But when this ship was
built, humans on Earth were just perfecting the mechanical clock, still
using steel crossbows in battle. Is there any way to see what's on
this? 
DATA: Questionable, sir. I believe I can supply power to its playback
unit, but its components are quite old. I will attempt to amplify its
image with my tricorder. 
GALEK SAR [on monitor]: I am Galek Sar, Captain of the Promellian
cruiser, Cleponji. I wish anyone who finds this record to know my crew
has behaved courageously. I want it recorded for all time that I,
alone, am responsible for the fate that befell us.
I have failed as a captain, and as the man responsible for all the
souls aboard my ship. 
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. 
RIKER [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. 
PICARD: I think we have seen all there is to see here. At Mister
O'Brien's leisure, we're ready to return. 
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.
