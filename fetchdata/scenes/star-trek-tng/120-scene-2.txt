(Geordi has attached a block to the side of his
visor) 
RIKER: What exactly does this device do? 
LAFORGE: Data and I have been working on a way to transmit what my
visor sees. If it works, the Bridge'll be able to monitor us. 
DATA: It has restrictions. The information from Geordi's visor is so
complex it is difficult to encode. Therefore the signal breaks down
easily. 
RIKER: That means it doesn't have much range. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. So far, the effective range is only few kilometres,
but we're working on it. La Forge to Bridge. 
WORF [OC]: This is the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Worf, I've switched on the Visual Acuity Transmitter. 
WORF [OC]: We are receiving. The signal is strong. 
LAFORGE: Okay, Worf. I am switching off for transport. 
RIKER: Set phasers on stun. Let's be ready for anything. Energise.

[Batris Corridor]

(Fallen girders, hanging wires, steam, and creaking
sounds) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge.

PICARD [OC]: This is the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm switching on the transmitter.
