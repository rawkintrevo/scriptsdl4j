[Corridor]

(Troi rings the bell of 08-1402 and Timothy opens
the door. He's wearing a jumper with a gold body section like a
starfleet uniform) 
TROI: Hello, Timothy. Are you ready to go? 
TIMOTHY: Yes, Counsellor. I am ready. 
TROI: How are you feeling? 
TIMOTHY: I am functioning within established parameters. 
TROI: Established parameters? You sound like Data. 
TIMOTHY: I am an android. 
TROI: I see. Well, let's go for our walk, shall we? 
TIMOTHY: That would be acceptable.

[Ten Forward]

TROI: So, what would you like? 
TIMOTHY: Androids do not need to eat or drink. (spots a dessert being
carried by a waiter) However, sometimes we like to taste things. A
Tamarin frost, please.
Would you like anything, Counsellor? 
TROI: No, I'm fine, thank you. 
TIMOTHY: As you wish. 
TROI: So you're no longer a human? 
TIMOTHY: I'm an android. 
TROI: When did this happen? 
TIMOTHY: I've always been an android. 
TROI: What's it like being an android? 
TIMOTHY: I am designed to exceed human capacity, both mentally and
physically. But I do not experience emotions. 
TROI: You don't? No emotion at all? 
TIMOTHY: That is correct.

[Ready room]

(Data is included in the meeting) 
PICARD: An android? 
TROI: I know it sounds unusual, but it is understandable. Technically,
it's called enantiodromia. Conversion into
the opposite. Timothy went from human to machine, from being emotional
to being emotionless. But the underlying trauma is still there. He's
just found a new way to suppress it. 
PICARD: Counsellor, how long will this behaviour last? 
TROI: As long as he needs it to. Timothy is rebuilding his identity as
best he can. The android persona is just one step along the way. As
soon as he feels stronger and more sure of himself, it should drop away
naturally. 
PICARD: I assume this is not a time to confront him about what happened
to his ship. 
TROI: Not yet. The best thing we can do right now is to let Timothy
take us where he wants to go. We should support the process and even
encourage it. 
PICARD: Data, I would like you to make Timothy the best android he can
possibly be.

[Timothy's quarters]

(Data checks his appearance in the mirror, then
tries to brush Timothy's hair to match his own) 
DATA: Timothy, your head movements are counterproductive. Can you be
still? 
TIMOTHY: But you do it. 
DATA: The servo mechanisms in my neck are designed to approximate human
movements. I did not realize the effect was so distracting. 
TIMOTHY: I like it. Data, are there any other androids in Starfleet? 
DATA: No. I am the only one. 
TIMOTHY: How come you're not Captain? 
DATA: My service experience does not yet warrant such a position. 
TIMOTHY: Data, what's the scariest thing that ever happened to you? 
DATA: Fear is a quality that I do not possess. 
TIMOTHY: Because it's an emotion? 
DATA: Correct. 
TIMOTHY: But what if you had a nightmare? 
DATA: I have never had a nightmare. I do not require sleep. Timothy,
are you having disturbing dreams? 
TIMOTHY: I do not require sleep. 
DATA: Is that satisfactory? (the hair) 
TIMOTHY: It's perfect.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Transfer circuits are functioning
properly. 
TIMOTHY: Within established parameters? 
CRUSHER: Absolutely. Input processing, pattern recognition, all within
established parameters. 
DATA + TIMOTHY: Thank you, Doctor.

[Data's quarters]

(They are both painting - Data is doing a
traditional pastoral landscape whilst Timothy's image is, well, angry) 
TIMOTHY: I ran out of red ochre. 
DATA: You may use mine. 
TIMOTHY: Thank you. (yawns) 
DATA: Perhaps you should return to your quarters. 
TIMOTHY: I'm fine. The servo mechanisms in my mouth are designed to
approximate human movements. 
(Data tries a yawn) 
TIMOTHY: That is not bad. 
DATA: Thank you. (re painting) It is very expressive. 
TIMOTHY: Thank you. 
DATA: Is your painting representative of something? 
TIMOTHY: It's just a painting. 
DATA: Timothy, you understand that you may speak with me about anything
you wish? Any subject? 
TIMOTHY: I understand. 
DATA: At times, I too find it difficult to share my thoughts with
others. I am not always confident that I am expressing myself in a
manner which humans can comprehend. But do I know that 
(Data sees that Timothy has fallen asleep and carries him to the couch)

[Bridge]

WORF: We are approaching the perimeter. I'm picking
up the gravitational wavefronts. 
RIKER: Engage forward shields thirty five percent. 
WORF: Shields up. 
(the ship rocks in the waves) 
PICARD: Drop to one quarter impulse, Ensign. 
FELTON: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Bridge to Engineering.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Adjusting shield frequencies now,
Commander. We'll have this smoothed out in just a second.
