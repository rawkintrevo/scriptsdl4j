[Vico]

(flickering lights, escaping steam, debris, bodies.
A falling girder nearly catches the away team as they start to move
through the ship) 
DATA: This station is inoperable, sir. 
LAFORGE: This one seems to be stuck in a feedback loop. 
RIKER: Let's see if we can tap directly into the computer core. 
LAFORGE: The ODN junction is right down here. 
(takes of a panel) 
LAFORGE: Data? 
(puts the spare CPU down and sets up the laser link) 
DATA: Core transfer is engaged. 
(Geordi looks at the instrumentation on the device.)
LAFORGE: Exchange protocol verified. The files are intact. At least
some of them, anyway. 
(a high pitched voice is heard) 
RIKER: Stay here, Geordi. Data. 
(a little further along, they find a young boy trapped under
debris)
TIMOTHY: Are my parents alright?

Captain's log, supplemental. A young boy, shielded
from our initial sensor scans, has been discovered pinned beneath a
fallen beam. The degree of damage to the Vico is making our rescue
attempt difficult.

PICARD: Transporter room one, can you lock on
