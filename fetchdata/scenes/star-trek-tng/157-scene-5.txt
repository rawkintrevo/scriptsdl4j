[Bridge]

PICARD: Brull, will you show Mister Crusher the
course to set to the Hromi Cluster? 
GUEST4: A child? This doesn't inspire my confidence. 
(Picard gives him a withering glare. Brull goes over to the console but
clearly doesn't know what he's looking at) 
WESLEY: This is our present position. 
GUEST4: Set a heading for three four three mark seven two. 
WESLEY: That's going to take us through the centre of an asteroid belt.

GUEST4: What's the matter, kid? Can't you fly yourself around a couple
of rocks? 
WESLEY: Sure I can, but if we take this heading we can avoid the belt
completely, and only lose twelve point one minutes at warp seven. 
GUEST4: Have it your way, kid.

[Ten Forward]

GUEST3: For centuries, my planet was in chaos.
Loyalty to one's clan was absolute. The slightest injury to one member
demanded violent retaliation. 
PICARD: And these blood feuds could last for decades? 
GUEST3: The obsession with vengeance would be passed from generation to
generation. And with each act of retribution, the violence would
escalate. 
PICARD: It's not unlike much the history of my own planet. 
(Troi and Riker enter) 
GUEST5: Your pardon, Sovereign. May I be excused briefly? Commander Riker
requested that I prepare him an Acamarian dish. 
GUEST3: Of course, Yuta. 
(Brull enters and goes straight to the bar. He takes another man's
drink then heads over to Wesley's window seat) 
GUEST4: What are you doing? 
WESLEY: Homework. 
GUEST4: What is this? 
WESLEY: Math. 
GUEST4: I can see that, but what does it mean? 
WESLEY: This is the locally Euclidean metrisation of a k-fold
contravariant Riemannian tensor field. 
GUEST4: You good at it? You don't like me. 
WESLEY: I didn't say that. 
GUEST4: No problem. I have many friends that don't like me. But what do
you know about me? 
WESLEY: You're a thief. 
GUEST4: I do it to survive, not because I enjoy it. We Gatherers value
our freedom. We do as we want and we answer to no creature. 
WESLEY: Then why are you helping Sovereign Marouk to change all that? 
GUEST4: Maybe because I want something better for me, and for my
children. 
WESLEY: You have children? 
GUEST4: Yeah, two sons. One's just about your age. He's not any good at
math. 
(Yuta brings a tray to Troi and Riker's table) 
RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. 
GUEST5: With the help of one of your food stations. 
TROI: It's wonderful. 
RIKER: Truly excellent. 
GUEST5: Thank you. 
RIKER: Would you care to join us? 
GUEST5: I don't want to intrude. 
TROI: You're not. I was just leaving. Please, sit down. 
(Troi leaves) 
RIKER: It really is delicious. 
GUEST5: I'm glad it pleases you, Commander. 
RIKER: I'm not your commander. My name is William. 
GUEST5: I will call you William if you prefer. 
RIKER: I do. When you say Commander you say it like you say Sovereign
to Marouk. 
GUEST5: As a servant. You're an excellent commander, but you'd make a
poor sovereign. 
RIKER: Why's that? Not that I disagree. 
GUEST5: You're not comfortable with servants. 
RIKER: No, I prefer the company of equals. 
GUEST5: So you treat me as an equal. 
RIKER: And you're not comfortable with that? 
GUEST5: I'm not used to it. I've always been a servant. Not that I'm
complaining. The Sovereign treats me well. I have all that I could
want. 
RIKER: What about freedom? 
GUEST5: I can never have that. 
RIKER: Because you're the property of the Sovereign? 
GUEST5: No. I'm not her slave. I can leave whenever I wish. 
RIKER: But you have no place to go? 
GUEST5: Just the opposite. My path is all too clear. 
RIKER: Yuta, you're an excellent chef, but you speak in riddles. 
GUEST5: I've never been very good at conversation. 
GUEST3: Yuta. 
GUEST5: I believe the Sovereign wants me to return. Enjoy the parthas. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Sickbay to Commander Riker. I've discovered something
interesting, Will. 
RIKER: On my way.
