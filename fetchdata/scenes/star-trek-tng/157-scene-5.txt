MAROUK: A fine ship, Commander. 
RIKER: We're all very proud of her. 
MAROUK: Yuta, a light meal in twenty minutes. 
YUTA: (a young woman) May I be shown the kitchen, Commander? 
RIKER: You're the chef? 
YUTA: Yes. I'll prepare all meals for the Sovereign and her servants. 
RIKER: We can provide you with a kitchen, but it won't really be
necessary. These food dispensers can synthesise anything that you may
been. I'll show you. Sovereign, may I offer you a drink? 
MAROUK: Yes, thank you. Cold water. 
RIKER: Computer, a glass of water, five degrees. 
YUTA: Please. 
(She takes the glass and sips it)
RIKER: You're also the food taster? 
YUTA: That's part of the cook's duty. 
(She takes the drink to Marouk) 
YUTA: I'm sure the Sovereign will wish to sample many of the cuisines
your ship has to offer, but there are
some Acamarian dishes that she will insist upon. 
RIKER: I will arrange for a technician to help programme your recipes
into the computer. Of course, I'll have to try some of them. What's
your specialty? 
YUTA: I have none. 
RIKER: Don't be modest. You can't tell me you haven't come up with a
few culinary delights. 
YUTA: There is a spiced parthas dish. 
RIKER: Parthas? 
YUTA: A green vegetable with fleshy roots. 
RIKER: Parthas a la Yuta. I look forward to tasting it. Sovereign.
Chef.

WESLEY: Now entering standard orbit of Gamma Hromi
Two, sir. 
DATA: Captain, I am detecting life readings from the planet surface, as
well as several small areas of thermal radiation and carbon dioxide
emissions, indicative of combustion. 
WESLEY: Campfires, Data. 
DATA: Is that not what I said? 
RIKER: It's worth a look. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
RIKER: Data, Worf.
