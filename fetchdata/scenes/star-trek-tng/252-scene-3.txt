[Outpost]

(Worf, Data, Riker and a female security officer
arrive to find the crew of the outpost are slumped over their consoles)

WORF: These wounds were caused by a forced plasma beam, similar to a
Ferengi hand phaser. 
RIKER: This seems brutal even for the Ferengi. Any sign of survivors? 
DATA: Electromagnetic interference is still making it difficult to get
a precise reading. 
RIKER: How many people were assigned to this outpost? 
WORF: Two hundred and seventy four. 
RIKER: All right. we're going to need to do a room to room search.
Worf, you and Corelki start searching the north wing. You and I will
take the south. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Data tries to open a door) 
DATA: The mechanism appears to be jammed, sir. 
RIKER: There's not much damage. It doesn't look like they were
interested in the station, just the people. 
DATA: I have bypassed the primary system. 
(the door opens to reveal - a Borg! after the titles the shooting
starts. Data takes out the first Borg and at least three more turn up,
pinning down our heroes)

[Bridge]

(meanwhile, the Enterprise is under attack) 
PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign! Return fire. 
LAFORGE: Shields down to eighty percent. Compensating with auxiliary
power.
