WORF: We've reached the designated coordinates,
Captain. There is a ship bearing three two seven mark one five two on
an intercept course. 
PICARD: Advise them of our status, Mister Worf. Go. Replicate what you
need, and see that the devices are properly distributed.
Not forgetting Mister Crusher.

(Worf and Beverly enter) 
CRUSHER: Wesley? Wesley? 
WESLEY [OC]: In here, Mom. 
(she looks round the door into his bedroom to see Wesley and Robin, on
the bed, playing the game. So Worf and Beverly leave) 
ROBIN: It worked. 
WESLEY: We should keep these mock-ups with us. We can't trust anyone
anymore. Not even the Captain. 
ROBIN: I'm supposed to be on duty in Engineering. I've got to get back
before Commander La Forge suspects something. 
WESLEY: Okay. When you get there, start accessing the codes for the
security tracking system. There's something I want to try. 
ROBIN: Wesley, don't forget Law Ninety One. Always watch your back. 
WESLEY: You too.

[Bridge]

WORF: The vessel is approaching, Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, all senior officers report to the Bridge. On screen. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Report. 
PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await your
further instructions. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander
Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you
will rendezvous with the starship Endeavour. Proceed with distributing
the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a
shuttle to Starbase sixty seven. Distribute the device to all starships
currently docked there. 
PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet
Academy. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Excellent. See to it. The Ktarians commend your
efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will
be rewarded.
