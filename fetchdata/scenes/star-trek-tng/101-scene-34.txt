[Passageway]

TASHA: We've found something interesting. We're in
a passageway directly under the station, sir. 
LAFORGE: But these tunnel walls are something I've never seen before,
sir. 
[Marketplace]

RIKER: How are you examining them? 
LAFORGE [OC]: In every way. 
[Passageway]

LAFORGE: Microscopically, thermally,
electromagnetically. None of it is familiar.
RIKER [OC]: What about you, Troi? 
TROI: Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in the
Groppler's office became very uncomfortable. 
[Marketplace]

RIKER: I'm sorry, Counsellor, but you must. We need
more information. 
[Passageway]

TROI: Pain. Such pain! Pain! 
[Marketplace]

RIKER: Hang on, I'm coming. Enterprise, lock us
onto her signal. 
[Passageway]

(Data and Riker beam into the passageway) 
RIKER: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. 
TROI: Unhappiness. Terrible despair. 
RIKER: Who? 
TROI: I don't know. No life form anything like us. 
RIKER: What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see?

LAFORGE: Well, it's of no material I recognise, sir, or have even heard
of. 
(They carry on exploring)
