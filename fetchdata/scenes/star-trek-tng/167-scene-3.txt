PICARD RIKER CRUSHER

[Ready room]

(Picard is so engrossed in what he is doing, that
the doorbell has to ring twice to get his attention) 
PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: Sir, it's been brought to my attention one of the crew has
been neglecting his health again. 
PICARD: How so? 
CRUSHER: It's a classic case of stress-related ailments brought on by
overwork. Exhaustion, irritability, muscle spasms. Yet he insists on
ignoring them. 
PICARD: Doesn't sound too serious. 
CRUSHER: And I plan to keep it that way. 
PICARD: What's the treatment. 
CRUSHER: A week's shore leave. 
PICARD: Impossible. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I could make that an order. 
PICARD: But you won't. Beverly, you know I loathe vacations. 
CRUSHER: You loathe going on vacations. Once you're there you have a
marvellous time. You told me your four days on Zytchin Three were
wonderful. 
PICARD: I lied. Look, the Enterprise is scheduled to spend a week
undergoing maintenance overhaul at Starbase twelve. While there, I
promise that I will make full use of available recreation activity. 
CRUSHER: Watching some technician fill deuterium tanks is not my idea
of fun. 
PICARD: I suppose I could find a few hours to spend on the holodeck. 
CRUSHER: Forget the holodeck. Isn't there someplace you want to go? 
PICARD: The Astrophysics Centre on Icor Nine is holding a symposium on
rogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending. 
CRUSHER: The last thing you need is serious thought. Jean-Luc, why
don't you go some place beautiful, where you can relax and be pampered.
You deserve it. 
PICARD: I'll give it serious thought. 
CRUSHER: Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor. Enough.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: So, have you decided where you're going yet?

PICARD: Yes I have, Number One. Bridge. 
RIKER: No, I meant on your shore leave. 
PICARD: Not you too. 
RIKER: Halt. I know this perfect little vacation spot. In fact, it
falls within the coordinates of this sector. 
PICARD: How convenient. Except, Number One, I have absolutely no
intention of taking a holiday. Is that clear? 
RIKER: Very clear. 
PICARD: Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. Resume. 
RIKER: The place is called Risa, and believe me, Captain, it is a
paradise. Warm tropical breezes, exotic food. Nothing to do but sit
around all day and enjoy the quiet. And then 
PICARD + RIKER: The women. 
PICARD: Of course. 
RIKER: I'm sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life very
appealing. 
PICARD: Oh, I'm sure.
