TROI LAFORGE PICARD PULASKI COMPUTER KINGSLEY DATA

[Corridor]

PULASKI: Deanna, do you have a minute? You've known
the Captain for some time. I think I need some advice. I don't seem to
be dealing with him very well. 
TROI: Why do you say that? 
PULASKI: Well, my arguments don't seem to have any affect on him. We
just end up quoting regulations to each other. He has such a consuming
dedication to his ship, he doesn't seem able to step back to see the
human side of the equation. 
(Troi smiles) 
PULASKI: What's the matter? 
TROI: Kate, I don't think he'd be where he is if he couldn't see the
human side of the equation. Perhaps the two of you aren't all that
different. 
PULASKI: What do you mean? 
TROI: Let's just say you both have well established personalities.

[Doctor's office]

PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, this is Kate Pulaski. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: Doctor? Do you have a decision? 
PULASKI: I'm afraid it's bad news. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: How can that be?! 
PULASKI: The risk to the ship and crew is too great. Until we
absolutely know the cause of the disease, the children 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: The children are harmless. Every test on them
has been negative. I demand that you do something to save them. Please,
Doctor. For God's sake, we haven't got much time. 
PULASKI: Stand by. I'll get back to you.

[Engineering]

PULASKI: Geordi, I need your help. 
LAFORGE: What is it, Doctor. 
PULASKI: I need to prove the children are harmless. I can only do that
in a fail-safe environment. 
LAFORGE: The problem is there's no area on the ship that can be sealed
off with absolute certainty, even with force fields. 
PULASKI: Sickbay has an isolated system. 
LAFORGE: But it's not possible to totally cut it off from the rest of
the ship. The only truly independent environment would be something
like a shuttlecraft. 
PULASKI: A shuttlecraft. Why didn't you say so?

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
PULASKI: Captain, I'd like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft.
I can study him there without risk to anyone else. 
PICARD: What about you? 
PULASKI: I'm prepared to take that risk. Someone has to breathe the
same air he breathes, to touch him. I'm volunteering to make that test
myself. 
PICARD: Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which goes 
PULASKI: I also have a responsibility to humanity. 
PICARD: Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined 
PULASKI: You don't have to quote the rule book. You were saying? 
PICARD: Request approved. 
PULASKI: Captain, you said if I. Approved? 
PICARD: I recognise that you're trying to satisfy my conditions. 
PULASKI: Thank you.

[Shuttlebay]

(Shuttlecraft Sakharov is being prepped for launch)

DATA: You sent for me, Doctor? 
PULASKI: I did, Commander. I assume that you're qualified to pilot this
shuttlecraft. 
DATA: Certainly. I took advanced training in the operation of auxiliary
space vessels at Starfleet Academy, where I
received 
PULASKI: A more than passing grade, no doubt. Please, come aboard. We
don't have much time. 
COMPUTER: Shuttlebay three force field activated.
