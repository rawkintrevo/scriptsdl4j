PICARD KELSEY

[Sickbay]

(Picard is mixing up ingredients) 
KELSEY [OC]: That wasn't very clever, Mister Mot.

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: If you knew where we were, you should have
attacked us. Now we'll just take another route. One you might not be
able 
[Sickbay]

KELSEY [OC]: To predict. 
PICARD: There are only so many ways to Ten Forward. Ten Forward is the
logical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep. 
[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: That sweep is just as big a threat to you
as it is to us. In fact, if I were you, Mister Mot 
[Sickbay]

KELSEY [OC]: I'd be trying to find a way off this
ship. 
(Picard's test concoction flares nicely) 
PICARD: I plan on leaving the same way you do. On your ship. 
[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: What ship?
PICARD [OC]: Come on, Kelsey. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD: If you've been planning this so long, you
must have a way of getting off the Enterprise and leaving this system.
I think you have a ship coming for you. I plan to be on it. 
[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: It's a small ship, Mot. I don't think
there's going to be room for both of us. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send your
regrets.
