[Transporter room]

(The lady transporter chief has very long hair, and
will eventually achieve fame as Lois Lane in the TV show. She beams
Okona aboard with his broken guidance module) 
WORF: Your weapons, please. 
OKONA: A Klingon Security officer. 
WORF: Yes. 
OKONA: No wars available, eh? 
(He hands over his gun belt, and Worf holds his hand out for the rest.
The knife is down the back of Okona's thigh boots) 
OKONA: It's more of a piece of jewellry than a weapon. A remembrance. 
RIKER: Welcome aboard, Captain Okona. I'm Commander Riker. If you'll
turn over the inoperative part to Commander Data, we can begin repairs.

OKONA: I'd be most happy to do the work myself, Commander. I'm sort of
the hands-on type. 
RIKER: I think you'd find the tools we use rather unusual, sir. 
OKONA: I can believe that. May I at least watch? 
RIKER: That can be arranged. 
OKONA: Good then. Commander, I leave this in your capable hands. 
(And gives the module to Wesley) 
WESLEY: Sir, this is Commander Data. I'm just an acting ensign. 
OKONA: Well, acting ensigns have names, don't they? 
WESLEY: Wesley. Wesley Crusher. 
OKONA: Nice to meet you Acting Ensign Wesley Wesley Crusher. (to
Robinson) And thank you for beaming me here and enabling me to see a
truly beautiful woman. You have the majestic carriage and loveliness
that could surely be traced back to the noblest of families. 
ROBINSON: Well, I'm sure that you've said that to many ladies before,
and it was no more true then than it is now. 
OKONA: But it's how I say it that's really important. The warmth, the
attraction that I have for you. The attraction that we share. 
RIKER: Mister Okona seems to have excellent vision as well as a healthy
libido. 
ROBINSON: (quietly) It's eight oh six. 
RIKER: Captain Okona, if you follow Commander Data, you can get started
right away.
