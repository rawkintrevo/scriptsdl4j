[Courtyard]

SOREN: There you are, Commander. I wondered what
had happened to our guest of honour. 
RIKER: I just needed some air. I can only take so much of these social
functions, and then I need to breathe a little. 
SOREN: I would think you had attended so many affairs like this that it
would become second nature to you. 
RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable in
crowded rooms. 
SOREN: What do you think of our planet? Isn't it beautiful? 
RIKER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. 
SOREN: We have many varieties of plant life. Perhaps you would like to
inspect some of them? 
RIKER: Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. 
SOREN: Please, let me take you on a tour. 
RIKER: Thank you. It's kind of you.

[Woods]

SOREN: One of my favourites is this menellen tree.
The leaves first turn pure white, and then blue, when the weather gets
cold. This is called a falla bush. It produces a fragrant flower on
only one day of the year. 
(and finally they get down to the real purpose of the walk, with Riker
trying to eat her tonsils)

Captain's log, stardate 45620.4. In the hope that a
detailed map of null space will prevent the loss of other ships, we
remain in orbit of J'naii, charting the anomaly.
