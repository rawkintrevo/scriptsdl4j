PICARD CRUSHER WORF

[Installation entrance]

(an incongruous metal door set in the rock wall) 
PICARD: Looks like a maintenance hatch to the installation. I'm picking
up three proximity sensors around it. 
(Worf puts a device on the ground that sends out beams to the door) 
WORF: Sensor echoes established, but the false image will only last a
few minutes. The hatch is magnetically sealed, but I believe I can
bypass it. 
CRUSHER: I can't get a scan from the other side of the hatch. It's been
shielded. 
PICARD: We have no choice. Remember, aim low. Fire in short, controlled
bursts. 
WORF: Ready. 
PICARD: Now.

[Chamber]

(the door slides open and they dash into another
rock chamber with just one single pulsing piece of equipment.) 
CRUSHER: There's no one here. There's no lab. PICARD: It's a trap. Come
on. 
(there is weapons fire, then the door starts to close. Worf blocks it
with his body. Beverly squeezes through but Picard is in hand-to-hand
combat) 
WORF: Captain! 
(an injured Cardassian shoots Worf in the shoulder and he falls out of
the chamber. By the time Picard gets there, the door is shut)

[Installation entrance]

CRUSHER: Let's go. WORF: The Captain. 
CRUSHER: No. There are five more of them heading this way from another
tunnel. Come on. Now!
