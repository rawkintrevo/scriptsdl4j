[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: The Borg have adapted their
electromagnetic field to prevent main transporter functions, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: As expected. Mister Data, Mister Worf, proceed as we
discussed. 
DATA: Aye, Captain. 
(They switch on devices on their arms)

[Battle bridge]

CREWMAN: Channel open, sir.
RIKER: We would like time to prepare our people for assimilation.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Preparation is irrelevant. Your people will be
assimilated as easily as Picard has been. Your attempt at a delay will
not be successful, Number One. We will proceed to Earth, and if you
attempt to intervene, we will destroy you.
RIKER: Then take your best shot, Locutus, because we're about to
intervene.
CREWMAN: Channel closed. 
RIKER: Reset subspace communications. Scrambler code, Riker One 
GLEASON: Scrambler code, Riker One. Acknowledged.
RIKER: Shelby, report.

complete.
