CARDASSIAN RIKER JELLICO CRUSHER DATA NECHAYEV

[Installation entrance]

CRUSHER: Let's go. WORF: The Captain. 
CRUSHER: No. There are five more of them heading this way from another
tunnel. Come on. Now! 
[Chamber]

(Picard drops his phaser. One of the Cardassians
switches off the device and they take their prisoner away) 
CARDASSIAN: Come on. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Captain on the Bridge. 
JELLICO: What have you got, Will? 
RIKER: I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from a
Cardassian planet near the border. 
JELLICO: Which planet? 
RIKER: Celtris Three. 
JELLICO: Can you detect any theta-band subspace emissions coming from
Celtris? 
RIKER: There are some residual traces. It seems there were emissions up
until a few minutes ago. 
JELLICO: Open a secure channel to Admiral Nechayev. Priority two. Put
it through to my Ready room. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

NECHAYEV [on monitor]: Captain? 
JELLICO: Those emissions you were so concerned about have just stopped.
I'd say one way or another, our friends have finished their task. 
NECHAYEV [on monitor]: Have you heard from our friends? 
JELLICO: No. 
NECHAYEV [on monitor]: Let me know if you do. I'd very much like to see
them again. 
JELLICO: So would I, Admiral.
