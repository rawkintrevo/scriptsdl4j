RIKER PATTERSON JAYGORDON MARISSA PICARD DATA

[Turbolift]

(Marissa is helping Picard at an open panel) 
PICARD: The external power is cut off. 
JAY GORDON: We're going to die. 
(the turbolift jolts) 
PATTERSON: What was that? 
PICARD: I don't know. 
(Marissa helps Picard stand. He tries to reach the hatch in the ceiling
but misses) 
PICARD: Your name is Marissa. Is that right? Well, Marissa, I'm going
to need a first officer to help me. You're the oldest and so that makes
you my Number One. 
MARISSA: Number One? 
PICARD: That's what I always called my first officer. So, here. 
(He puts two of his rank pins on her top) 
PICARD: There. Now, Number One, we need a crew to help us get that
hatch off. Don't
you think that Jay here would make an excellent science officer? What
do you say, Jay? Will you join our crew? 
JAY GORDON: It's Jay Gordon. 
PICARD: Of course. Forgive me, Jay Gordon. 
JAY GORDON: I accept. 
(another pin) 
PICARD: There. 
PATTERSON: Can I be an officer, too? 
PICARD: Well, let me see. Your science project involved radishes, did
it not? 
PATTERSON: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Then I shall appoint you my executive officer in charge of
radishes. 
(he gets the last pin) 
PICARD: There. Right, then let's get to work.

[Jefferies tube]

RIKER: Thirteen sixty five baker. That should put
us right behind shuttlebay two. 
DATA: That is correct, sir. We have approximately fifty two metres
remaining in this crawlway before we can safely exit into a main
corridor. 
(opaque gas bursts out behind them) 
RIKER: Coolant leak!
(they scramble forward and manage to shut a bulkhead behind them, only
for an energy barrier to start up ahead)
