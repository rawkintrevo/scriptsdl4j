[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Captain. 
SHELBY: Try the power systems, Data. See if you can get them to power
down. 
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged. 
[Data's lab]

DATA: Attempting new power subcommand path.

LAFORGE: Shields have failed. They've 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Locked on, sir. They're pulling us
in. 
RIKER: Fire all weapons.

[Data's lab]

DATA: I cannot penetrate Borg power subcommand
structure, sir. 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: All critical subcommands are protected,
Captain. 
SHELBY: Then it's over.
RIKER: Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You
heard me. A collision course.
WESLEY: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to go to warp power. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Data's lab]

PICARD: Sleep.
CRUSHER: He's regaining consciousness. 
PICARD: Sleep.
TROI: It is Captain Picard speaking, not Locutus.
PICARD: Sleep, Data.
CRUSHER: He's exhausted.
DATA: Yes, Doctor, but if I may make a supposition, I do not believe
his message was intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course of
action.

WORF: Borg cutting beam activated. 
RIKER: Mister Crusher? Engage. 
DATA [OC]: Data to Bridge. Stand by. 
RIKER: Stand by, all stations. 
[Data's lab]

DATA: I am attempting to penetrate the Borg
regenerative subcommand path. It is a low priority system and may be
accessible. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Outer hull breach.
WORF: Sir, shall I execute evacuation sequence? 
RIKER: Negative, Mister Worf. Mister Data, your final report. 
DATA [OC]: Stand by. 
RIKER: I can't, Mister Data. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Inner hull failure imminent on decks twenty three,
twenty four, and twenty five. Decompression danger. 
(Then suddenly it all goes quiet. No shaking, no cutting) 
RIKER: Mister Data, what the hell happened?

[Data's lab]

DATA: I successfully planted a command into the
Borg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe it
was time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep.
