RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD DATA

  [Bridge]

WORF: Captain. Communication from Starfleet. They
have reported a disturbance in the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Of what nature? 
WORF: A battle. Quadrant nine, coordinates zero seven zero, mark three.
There's no information who is involved. They are asking if we can
investigate. 
PICARD: Answer affirmative. Lieutenant La Forge, lay in the course. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
DATA: I have no reports of any Federation ships in that area, sir. 
RIKER: Ferengi? 
PICARD: It's a little out of their territory. 
RIKER: Shall we separate the saucer? 
PICARD: Let's get a little more information first. 
LAFORGE: Course set, Captain. 
PICARD: Speed, warp seven. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir, warp seven. 
PICARD: Engage. 
(A short flight later) 
LAFORGE: We are now approaching the Neutral Zone. 
TASHA: Sir, sensors indicate several recent photon explosions and heavy
phaser activity. 
DATA: Sir, I have analysed the residue from the explosions. This is of
no known Ferengi design. It is possibly Romulan. 
PICARD: Now there's a name we haven't heard for a while. 
RIKER: I could go a lot longer without hearing it. 
PICARD: If the Romulans have returned to this sector we should know
about that. Mister Worf, any further activity? 
WORF: Negative, sir. 
PICARD: Slow to half impulse. 
LAFORGE: Going to one half impulse. Now entering quadrant nine zero
seven, mark three. 
PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. Go to Yellow Alert. 
DATA: I have located a vessel, sir. It is drifting. 
PICARD: Put it on main viewer. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
(An angular, practical ship, like an Eagle transporter) 
DATA: The life support systems on the ship are failing, sir.
Propulsion, navigation, and all communication, inoperative. 
PICARD: Any trace of the other vessel? 
DATA: No, sir. 
RIKER: If it is a Romulan vessel, it could be cloaked. 
PICARD: Tell Starfleet we're entering the Neutral Zone. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, take us in a little closer. 
LAFORGE: Aye, aye, sir. 
PICARD: Stay sharp everyone. 
RIKER: It's Talarian. 
PICARD: Life signs? 
WORF: Nothing yet, sir. 
DATA: I have identified the vessel, Captain. It is the Batris, a
general cargo vessel. 
RIKER: A long way from home. 
PICARD: Keep alert. 
WORF: Captain, possible life signs. 
PICARD: What do you mean, possible? 
WORF: The readings emanate from a location near what is left of main
Engineering. There is a great deal of magnetic and radioactive clutter
making a positive determination difficult. 
RIKER: I'll prepare an away team. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, you stay at your post. If this is the result of
a Romulan attack, they may still be in the area. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Data, Geordi, let's go. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, are we close enough to use the Visual Acuity
transmitter? 
LAFORGE: We can certainly try it, sir. 
PICARD: Please do. And Number One? Everything about this seems wrong. 
RIKER: Agreed. It smells like a trap. Let's go.

Captain's log, stardate 41503.7. We have entered
the Neutral Zone, where a Talarian freighter has been severely damaged
in a battle. I have sent an away team to investigate.
