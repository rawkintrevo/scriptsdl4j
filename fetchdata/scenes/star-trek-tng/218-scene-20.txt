[Someone's quarters]

RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the
deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. 
WORF: I hope so. 
RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I am experiencing nIb'poH. The feeling I have done this before. 
RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. 
WORF: That is not what I mean. 
CRUSHER: I've been having the same feeling. Wait. An eight, an Ace, a
Queen and a four. Deal the cards, Data. 
(Data deals everyone a three) 
DATA: Three. All threes. 
CRUSHER: I was positive I knew what cards were going to be dealt. 
WORF: I was also sure. 
RIKER: Finish dealing the hand. 
(Riker gets all eights, Worf all Kings, Crusher all tens and Data all
sixes) 
RIKER: Look at this, we've all got three of a kind. 
CRUSHER: First we get a three, and then three of a kind. 
OGAWA [OC]: Ogawa to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Go ahead. 
OGAWA [OC]: Commander La Forge needs you in Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: I'm on my way.

LAFORGE: At first I thought the catwalk was
spinning. As it turns out, it was me. I was lucky Ensign Fletcher was
there to grab me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. 
CRUSHER: You have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection. That
would explain the headaches, dizziness. But I don't see any physical 
LAFORGE: What? What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi, have you ever had these symptoms before? 
LAFORGE: Now that you mention it, I think I have. 
CRUSHER: Do you recall when? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't. 
CRUSHER: I know we've had this discussion before, and I remember giving
you this examination. Let's check the medical logs. You've been treated
several times for headaches related to your visor but there's no
mention of dizziness. 
LAFORGE: Must be dj vu. 
CRUSHER: Both of us? About the same thing? I'd like to run an optical
diagnostic. 
LAFORGE: For an ear infection? 
CRUSHER: I have a hunch. Hold still. This pulse may be a little bright.
Have you made any changes to your visor lately? 
LAFORGE: No. Why? 
CRUSHER: I'm detecting a small phase shift in your visual receptors.
