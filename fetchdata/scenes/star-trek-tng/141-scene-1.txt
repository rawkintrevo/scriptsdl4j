RIKER WORF PICARD TROI COMPUTER DATA

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, I've been reviewing the unmanned
probe scans. At some point during the last one hundred and fifty years,
the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema has shattered, forming an asteroid
belt. 
RIKER: I'd call that geological instability. 
WORF: Is there any indication that this is the work of an unknown
intelligence? 
RIKER: This is geology, not malevolence. These planets live fast and
die hard. The question is, why?

PICARD: You're sure you won't reconsider? 
TROI: No, I'll just watch you and be impressed. 
PICARD: An optimistic vote of confidence from a non-rider. 
TROI: You know, I never particularly thought of you as an animal
person. 
PICARD: Small animals, no, but horses. Computer, programme the holodeck
for a woodland setting, with a bridle path and an appropriate mount. 
COMPUTER: Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu, Klingon Sark 
PICARD: Horse. Earth horse. 
COMPUTER: Breed? 
PICARD: Arabian. The Arabs believed that Allah gathered the south wind
and made the horse. 
TROI: On the holodeck we've made that legend come true. 
PICARD: I like that. Oh yes, computer, English tack, and I will control
the animal myself. 
COMPUTER: Enter when ready.
