(Corey is under the don-jot table with a
screwdriver) 
PICARD: Corey. 
COREY: Ow! Johnny, don't sneak up on me like that. I thought you were
the gambling foreman. 
PICARD: Sorry. 
COREY: I'm glad you're here. Hand me that magnaspanner. 
PICARD: Corey, I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you from
making a serious mistake. 
COREY: You sound like my mother. 
PICARD: Cheating the Nausicaans could have serious consequences for all
of us. It's a risk we can't afford to take. 
COREY: You are my mother. Well gee, Mom, I guess I'll have to go tell
those Nausicaans I don't mind if they cheat me. 
PICARD: This is not a joke, Corey. 
COREY: It better be. Now, I'm going to finish my work here. If you want
to help me, fine. If not, I'll see you back at the Starbase. 
PICARD: I said you're not doing this. 
COREY: Are you going to hit me, Johnny? 
PICARD: No. But I'll tell the gambling foreman someone's been tampering
with his dom-jot table. 
COREY: All right. Have it your way, Ensign Picard.
