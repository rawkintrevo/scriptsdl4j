DATA: The reading I received is from behind this
door, sir.

[Hotel room]

DATA: My reading is intensifying, sir. 
RIKER: Are you getting any life signs? 
DATA: None, sir. 
(Riker pulls back the bedsheet to reveal the desiccated remains of a
person, mostly skeleton with some remaining skin) 
DATA: Definitely human. Male. 
RIKER: Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. 
WORF: What a terrible way to die. 
DATA: He has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years, sir. The
lack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. 
(Worf opens the wardrobe) 
RIKER: Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just window
dressing for a dead man. 
WORF: Commander. 
DATA: Is this significant, sir? 
(It's a spacesuit on a hangar) 
RIKER: American. 
DATA: Fifty two stars sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD. It
correlates with the debris we found. Colonel S. Richey. Rest in peace,
Colonel.

RIKER: This structure was apparently made to
resemble twentieth century Earth. All efforts to exit have failed.

RIKER: I assumed as much, sir. We've also located the remains of a
human. Request identity scan. Colonel Richey. American. First initial
S. Roughly the same time period.
