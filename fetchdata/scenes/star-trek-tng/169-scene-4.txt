[Ready room]

PICARD: I'm not accustomed to seeing an
unsatisfactory rating for one of my crew. 
RIKER: I guess the issue is whether Mister Barclay is Enterprise
material. 
PICARD: I assume from your request for his transfer that you think he's
not, Commander. 
LAFORGE: I hate to say it but, I always thought I could work with
anybody. But I just don't understand this guy. Broccoli makes me
nervous, Captain. He makes everybody nervous. 
PICARD: Broccoli? 
RIKER: Young Mister Crusher started that. I guess it's caught on. 
PICARD: Let's just get that uncaught, shall we? There's every
indication he's served competently in Starfleet for years. His ratings
aboard the Zhukov were satisfactory. In fact I recall Captain Gleason
speaking quite highly of him before his transfer. 
RIKER: In retrospect, I wonder if Captain Gleason wasn't buttering our
bread a little. He knew we were looking for a diagnostic engineer. I've
examined Barclay's psychological profile. He's a history of seclusive
tendencies. It was noted at the Academy more than once. 
PICARD: And yet he chose this way of life. He has made the same
commitment to Starfleet that we all have. It's easy to transfer a
problem to someone else. Too easy. 
LAFORGE: Captain, it's not like I haven't tried. 
PICARD: Try harder, Geordi. He's a member of your team. Try to find
some way to help him to make a positive contribution. Get to know the
man better. Make him your best friend. 
LAFORGE: With all respect, sir, my best friend? I can barely tolerate
being in the same room with the man. 
PICARD: Then I suggest you put your personal discomfort on one side,
Commander. Dismissed. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir.

the components of the anti-grav sled) 
LAFORGE: Hey, Reg. How, er, how's it going? 
BARCLAY: Oh, it's, er, I still haven't traced down the problem,
Commander. 
LAFORGE: That's all right. There's no problem. 
BARCLAY: I've been planning to run diagnostics on the graviton invertor
circuits. 
LAFORGE: Smart plan. I'd say we're in good hands here. 
BARCLAY: I'll see you get a preliminary report. 
LAFORGE: Whenever. 
BARCLAY: Before the end of the day. 
LAFORGE: Fine. Say, Reg, how about sitting in on the mission briefing
with my senior officers in the morning? 
BARCLAY: The briefing? Me? 
LAFORGE: I'd like your input. 
BARCLAY: What on? Do, do, do you want me to prepare a 
LAFORGE: No, no, just be there. Eight hundred hours. 
BARCLAY: I'll be on time, sir. 
LAFORGE: Good. Good. Carry on.
