PICARD VASH JOVAL SOVAK
ball followed puzzling offering pocket federation truth friend mistake

[Poolside]

(Picard and his book are splashed by someone
running past. Then a hoverball interrupts him.) 
JOVAL: Return. (the ball goes back to her) My apologies. I fear I have
yet to master the art of hoverball. 
PICARD: So it would seem. 
JOVAL: My name is Joval. I am employed here. Is there anything you
require to make your stay a more pleasant one? 
(Picard shakes his head) 
JOVAL: You find me amusing. 
PICARD: No. It's just that you are the fifth woman to ask me that
question this morning. All I require is to sit in the sun and read my
book. Alone. 
JOVAL: And afterward? 
PICARD: I really haven't thought that far ahead. 
JOVAL: Then may I suggest a swim to be followed by a massage? 
PICARD: Some other time perhaps. 
JOVAL: I don't understand. You say you wish to be alone yet you carry
the Horga'hn. 
PICARD: I just purchased that. Why? Are you implying this has some
special meaning? 
JOVAL: The Horga'hn is the Risian symbol of sexuality. To own one is to
call forth it powers. To display it is to announce you are seeking
Jamaharon. 
PICARD: Riker! 
JOVAL: Do you seek Jamaharohn? 
PICARD: I don't even know what it means. The Horga'hn is for a friend. 
JOVAL: I see. Someone close to you? 
PICARD: That's right. 
JOVAL: Someone you love? 
PICARD: I wouldn't go that far. 
JOVAL: Your attitude is most puzzling. I will leave you now to your
book. 
PICARD: That is all I ask. 
(Joval leaves, Picard hides the naughty statuette under a towel. Then a
Ferengi casts a shadow over him) 
PICARD: You're blocking the suns. 
SOVAK: I know you're working with her. I warn you, it's a mistake. 
PICARD: Are you addressing me? 
SOVAK: Don't bother to deny it. I've seen the two of you together. 
PICARD: I don't know what the devil you're talking about. But whatever
it is, I assure you it's no concern of mine. 
SOVAK: Tell her I want the disc returned to me immediately. 
PICARD: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. You have the wrong man. 
SOVAK: I am rapidly losing patience with you. I demand you talk
business. 
PICARD: You'll find Ferengi demands carry little weight with me. 
SOVAK: Obviously you've never dealt with my people before. 
PICARD: On the contrary, all too often. 
SOVAK: Then you know the Ferengi are not to be trifled with. 
PICARD: Or trusted. 
SOVAK: You dare to insult me? 
PICARD: I advise you to listen closely for I will not say this again. I
came to Risa for a holiday, nothing more. I have no knowledge of this
woman of whom you speak, nor have I laid eyes on any disc. 
SOVAK: You expect me to believe such feeble lies? 
PICARD: I don't care what you believe! 
SOVAK: This is not over yet, human. The disc is mine! And so is the
woman. Remember that. 
(Sovak leaves. Vash ends her massage and comes over) 
VASH: Hello. 
PICARD: Oh, it's you. 
VASH: That's not much of a greeting. 
PICARD: Look, I don't wish to appear rude, but I am not seeking
jamaharon. 
VASH: All right, but you really should try it some time. 
PICARD: If I try it, it will be at a time of my own choosing. 
VASH: That's fine with me. It's not as though I was offering to help
you find it. 
PICARD: I, er, I assumed because of the way you welcomed me the other
day. 
VASH: I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. 
PICARD: I don't recall saying I was embarrassed. If's just that I
prefer to be acquainted with the women that I kiss. 
VASH: That's understandable. The name's Vash. 
PICARD: Jean-Luc Picard. 
VASH: So tell me about yourself, Jean-Luc. 
(He tries to return to his book) 
VASH: Would you rather I guess? I can be very persistent. 
PICARD: I'm the captain of a Federation starship. 
VASH: That explains it. 
PICARD: Explains what? 
VASH: I noticed you arguing with that Ferengi. For a moment there it
looked like it was going to come to blows. 
PICARD: You're the woman he was talking about? 
VASH: I hope your disagreement wasn't over me. 
PICARD: For that information you'll have to ask him. 
VASH: Where are you going? 
PICARD: To find some privacy. 
VASH: Wait a second. 
[Resort lobby]

VASH: What did he tell you? I'm sure there wasn't a
bit of truth to it. 
SOVAK: And you said you didn't know her. 
PICARD: I don't. And I don't want to. 
SOVAK: Return the disc to me and all will be forgiven. 
VASH: The disc doesn't belong to you, Sovak. It never did. 
PICARD: It would seem you two have a lot to discuss. If you'll excuse
me. 
VASH: Jean-Luc, I'm sorry. Perhaps one day I could explain all this to
you later. 
(She slips something into his pocket) 
PICARD: Perhaps you can. 
(Picard leaves) 
SOVAK: I have a proposal I believe you'll find most interesting. 
VASH: Save your breath. 
SOVAK: I am willing to pay you your weight in gold in exchange for the
disc. Is that not a generous offer? 
(Vash leaves) 
SOVAK: I must have that woman.
