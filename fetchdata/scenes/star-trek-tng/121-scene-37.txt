TASHA: Maybe you should wait here while Data and I
search for the Captain and Doctor Crusher. 
RIKER: No, I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right. 
DATA: I am getting energy readings. Look out! 
(They're under attack again) 
TASHA: We'll do it just like before. 
(But there's a difference) 
TASHA: It's got a deflector shield. 
DATA: The product continues to upgrade and improve. 
TASHA: We'll concentrate our fire and try to collapse its shield.
Commander, we'll need you too. 
(It drops it's shield to fire at them) 
TASHA: Now! (Three phasers and it takes some time for it to go boom)
You're right, they keep getting better. 
DATA: The weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely twelve
minutes. 
TASHA: Well this one took everything we had. I don't know how we'll
handle the next one. 
RIKER: We're not going to wait around. Let's find the rest of our team.

[Cavern]

PICARD: We seem to be in some kind of underground
structure, but I don't see any. Hey, no, you don't. No time to sleep. 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. 
PICARD: Come on, stay with me. Come on now, stay awake. That's an
order. 
CRUSHER: I must have lost a lot of blood. 
PICARD: I've stopped the bleeding. 
CRUSHER: No, there's another wound. My leg. 
(He brushes the dirt off her leg and she winces) 
PICARD: Not to worry, Everything is going to be fine. Now, this is
going to hurt a bit. 
CRUSHER: I've heard that before. 
PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Stay awake. Come on. There's a lot of blood.
What do I do next? Doctor. 
CRUSHER: The wound needs a clotting agent. 
PICARD: I couldn't find your medical kit. 
CRUSHER: Those roots. What are they? 
PICARD: Roots? What, these? 
CRUSHER: Break off a piece and taste it. Don't swallow it. 
PICARD: Very bitter. 
CRUSHER: Apply some to your hand. Is there a colour change? 
PICARD: It's turning yellowish. 
CRUSHER: Good. Now, spread as much of it as you can onto the wound. 
PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Now, stay awake. You've got to help me. I
need your help. All right, now listen. Your patient has lost a great
deal of blood from multiple lacerations. 
CRUSHER: The patient's going into shock. 
PICARD: So what do I do? 
CRUSHER: Elevate the legs and try to keep her warm. 
PICARD: Good. All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking. 
CRUSHER: You didn't happen to bring a blanket with you, did you? 
PICARD: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end.
Stay awake.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: All right, I know it's risky, but a shot
in the dark is better than nothing. Let's see if we can get lucky. 
T'SU: I can't seem to pin down the pattern. 
LAFORGE: There. 
T'SU: Sorry, sir, I should have seen that. 
LAFORGE: That's all right, you're doing fine. 
WORF: Programme laid in. Phasers and photon torpedoes ready. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Mister Solis, bring her about to two three mark one
eight five. 
SOLIS: Aye, sir. 
(They are attacked again) 
LAFORGE: Fire! Now! 
WORF: Phasers and photons firing. We missed. 
T'SU: Number four shield buckling. Number three shield nearing failure.

LOGAN [OC]: Bridge, this is Engineering. I can't hold this power level
much longer. You've got to do something. 
T'SU: Backup systems are overloaded. Backup systems failing. 
LOGAN [OC]: La Forge, this is Logan. Tell me something. 
LAFORGE: Mister Logan, report to the Bridge. 
LOGAN [OC]: On my way. 
WORF: Deflectors are breaking down. We have less than one minute of
reserve. 
(Logan enters) 
LAFORGE: We are getting out of here. Lieutenant Solis, set course three
one five mark zero, zero seven. 
SOLIS: Course set. 
LOGAN: You are leaving them on the planet. 
LAFORGE: Speed warp five. 
SOLIS: Warp five. Aye. 
LAFORGE: Engage. Hold course and speed for twenty eight seconds, then
come to a full stop. Mister Logan, had we stayed, we would have been
destroyed. Now, there are over a thousand people on this ship. I have a
responsibility to them. 
LOGAN: What about your responsibility to Captain Picard and the members
of the away team? 
LAFORGE: I have a responsibility to them as well. Mister Logan, you are
going to take command of the Saucer Section. Backup crew, report to the
main Bridge. 
LOGAN: You're going to separate? 
LAFORGE: Yes, and I want you to take the saucer section and proceed
immediately to Starbase one zero three. 
LOGAN: You can't fight what you can't see, and you still won't be able
to see that thing. 
LAFORGE: Maybe we won't have to. 
LOGAN: Risky. 
LAFORGE: Yes. That's why we're going to separate. Worf, Solis, T'Su.
Report to the Battle Bridge. I'll join you in a moment. 
WORF: Ensign, secure connector levels. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

LAFORGE: Come in. 
TROI: Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, we're a few minutes away from separating the
battle section. I don't have a lot of time. 
TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotional
fitness of the crew. 
LAFORGE: And you sense I'm nervous. Well, you're right. Counsellor,
deep down I'm shaking. I'm about to take this ship into battle, and
there's a good chance she'll be blasted out of the sky. I'm taking a
huge risk here, and there are a lot of lives at stake. So, yeah, I'm
nervous. Did you expect otherwise? 
TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you've
ever experienced. 
LAFORGE: You think I'm about to crack? 
TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handling
command. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some very
difficult decisions. 
LAFORGE: Then what did you want to see me about? 
SOLIS [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge. Battle bridge is manned and ready.
However, deflectors have not yet returned to full efficiency. 
LAFORGE: Let's get them there, Mister Solis. 
SOLIS [OC]: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: I'll join you shortly. La Forge out. 
TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? 
LAFORGE: Solis is doing a fine job. 
TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both he
and Ensign T'Su are very young. 
LAFORGE: No, wait. They're good officers. 
TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried about
making mistakes, and they need some encouragement. 
LAFORGE: What do I do? 
TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to you
for guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. 
LAFORGE: Like Captain Picard showed confidence in me. Right. I
understand. Thanks, Counsellor. 
[Battle bridge]

LAFORGE: Prepare to initiate separation sequence. 
T'SU: All decks report ready. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Now. 
(The saucer rises away) 
COMPUTER: Main latch bags to zero. Main latch retraction one to one
eight, initiate. Static charge compensate. 
WORF: Separation complete. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Solis, lay in a reciprocal course for Minos, warp
five. 
SOLIS: Course set. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Engage. 
[Cavern]

(Picard and Crusher are far enough apart to be out
of sight of each other, but not earshot) 
PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: No exits? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
CRUSHER: If you find one, go. 
PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. I need to sleep. Woke up too early. 
PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about those
roots. How did you know their medicinal values? 
CRUSHER: My grandmother. 
PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? 
CRUSHER: No. 
PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? 
CRUSHER: No. She helped to colonise Arveda Three. 
PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use
what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then
taught it to me. 
PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But then
there must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. 
CRUSHER: Quite a few. 
PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt.
It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. 
(He presses a button and the whole wall lights up) 
PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. 
CRUSHER: Tracking what? 
PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. 
SALESMAN: Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. 
CRUSHER: Who's that? 
PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the
Enterprise. What unit? 
SALESMAN: Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement.
The ultimate in weapons system technology. 
PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? 
SALESMAN: Impressive demonstration, isn't it? 
PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. 
SALESMAN: Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does
it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground
personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. 
PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. 
SALESMAN: Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and
all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery,
whatever you need. 
CRUSHER: It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. 
SALESMAN: The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic,
adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. 
PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are the
people of Minos? 
SALESMAN: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing
system.
PICARD: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you.
What was that noise? 
SALESMAN: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new,
stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon
against the targets on the surface. 
PICARD: Abort it! 
SALESMAN: Why would I want to do that? It can't demonstrate its
abilities unless we let it leave the nest. 
[Planet surface]

DATA: They are down there, sir. 
RIKER: Let's clear some of that away. 
TASHA: If Data's calculations are correct, the next one should show
itself in two minutes. 
RIKER: Captain!
