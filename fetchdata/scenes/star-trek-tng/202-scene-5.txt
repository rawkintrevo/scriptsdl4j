PICARD DATHON WORF
thank runes casts just lit holding beneath shuttlecraft mean

[Planet surface]

(it is night. Dathon has lit a cozy fire while
Picard is only just getting his started when it goes out) 
DATHON: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
PICARD: Shaka indeed. What now, Captain? Will you attack me in my
sleep? If I don't freeze to death first. 
DATHON: Darmok of Kanza. Jalad of the Kituay. 
PICARD: Picard of the Federation. Of the starship Enterprise. Of the
planet Earth. 
DATHON: Kadir beneath Mo Moteh. 
(he casts some runes to make his mind up then lies down to sleep with
his dagger. But Picard is pacing. Dathon gets up and throws a flaming
brand towards him) 
DATHON: Temba. 
PICARD: Temba? What does that mean? Fire? Does Temba mean fire? 
DATHON: Temba. His arms wide. 
PICARD: Temba is a person? His arms wide. Because he's holding them
apart in, in generosity. In giving. In taking. 
DATHON: Temba. His arms wide. 
(Picard accepts the gift of fire, and Dathon smiles) 
PICARD: Thank you. Thank you.

First Officer's log, supplemental. I am sending a
shuttlecraft to find Captain Picard, gambling that the Tamarians will
sit tight rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire.
