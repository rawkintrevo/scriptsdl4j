KYLE: Scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me. 
PULASKI: That's right. I thought I knew you, Kyle. 
KYLE: You do, as well as anyone. 
PULASKI: Then what is this I hear about an anbo-jyutsu match with Will?

KYLE: You've heard. 
PULASKI: Haven't we grown beyond the point where we resolve our
problems with physical conflict? 
KYLE: I think you're overreacting. 
PULASKI: I'm overreacting? You're the one who's going out to fight with
his own son. 
KYLE: Don't think of it as a fight, Kate. Think of it as more of a
contest. 
PULASKI: And suppose one of you is injured? 
KYLE: I know where to find a good doctor. Kate 
PULASKI: Kyle. 
KYLE: Will and I have been playing anbo-jyutsu ever since he was eight
old, and he knows how to handle himself. And so do I. 
PULASKI: Don't take this personally, but Will is in his prime. 
KYLE: And I'm no spring chicken, I know. Don't worry. He's never been
able to beat me.

(A forbidding setting, lit with red light. There is
a channel between two raised platforms) 
DATA: Computer, is this it? 
COMPUTER: Correct. Klingon Rite of Ascension Chamber. 
LAFORGE: Is this really necessary? 
WESLEY: If we want to get Worf through his problem, it is. 
DATA: Computer, please give us Klingon personnel appropriate to this
event. 
(Four warriors stand on each side of the channel, with metre-long
painstiks) 
DATA: These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites. 
LAFORGE: Cute bunch. 
WESLEY: And they use those? 
O'BRIEN: Those are Klingon painstiks. I once saw one of them used
against a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor creature jumped five metres at
the slightest touch. It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures.

WESLEY: You mean? 
O'BRIEN: That's right. The animal's head exploded like 
PULASKI: I think that's enough, Chief O'Brien.

WORF: I do not enjoy riddles, Counsellor. 
TROI: You will enjoy this one. 
WORF: I am in no mood for trifling or games, not today. 
TROI: I know what an important day this is for you, the anniversary of
your Rite of Ascension. 
WORF: You know about that? 
TROI: All your friends on board do. 
WORF: That is impossible. It is a secret known only to Klingons. 
TROI: And certain resourceful young Ensigns. 
WORF: Wesley Crusher. What does he know about it? 
TROI: Just bear with me. 
WORF: Where are we going? 
TROI: The holodeck. 
WORF: This is truly trying my patience, Counsellor. 
TROI: I think you will approve. 
WORF: You're not coming in? 
TROI: No. 
WORF: Open.
