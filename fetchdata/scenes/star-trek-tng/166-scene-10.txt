HARO RIKER LAFORGE PICARD TROI ESOQQ THOLL DATA

[Ready room]

PICARD 2: Number One, you know I like to keep you
well informed as to the nature of our missions. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
PICARD 2: And if I don't inform you there is a reason. I don't like
keeping you in the dark, but for the next few days I may not be able to
be as communicative as usual. It may make things difficult for you. 
RIKER: Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it. 
PICARD 2: And the crew? 
RIKER: You can count on all of us, sir. 
PICARD 2: I appreciate that, Number One.

[Holding cell]

(Picard is tapping on the panel, 2 taps, then 3,
then 5, and so on) 
THOLL: Picard, what are you doing? 
PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possess
intelligence. 
THOLL: You don't think they already know that? They can hear us
talking. 
PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating through
language. 
HARO: Captain Picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by
tapping out the first six prime numbers. 
THOLL: I know what he's doing. I'm trying to understand why. 
PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, find
out what they want. 
THOLL: Obviously, they want us. 
PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makes
us special? 
HARO: I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I am just one
cadet. 
PICARD: What's your best area of study? 
HARO: Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. 
PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? 
HARO: I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why
didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? 
PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy
truce with the Moropa, are they not? 
HARO: That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology and,
even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with either of
you? 
THOLL: I've never even heard of the Moropa. My race has no enemies. 
PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, your
planet has been conquered six times! 
THOLL: And we've survived by not resisting. Mizarians value peace above
confrontation. 
PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. 
THOLL: No. I don't know of anyone who bears malice toward my race. 
PICARD: Or against you personally? 
THOLL: You can't mean to suggest that someone with a personal grudge
against me has gone to all this trouble. 
PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up with
some explanation for your abduction. 
THOLL: I'm sorry, Picard. I can't give you one. I am neither important
enough to hold for ransom nor radical enough to be dangerous. I'm a
simple public servant. 
PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl 
(There's a sound and a sparkling, and a figure in leather appears on
the fourth bed. He has lots of red hair and sharp teeth, and pulls a
dagger) 
PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. We
are not the enemy. 
ESOQQ: Who has done this? 
PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Our
captors refuse to show themselves. 
ESOQQ: I don't trust you. 
PICARD: You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Were
you abducted from Chalna? 
ESOQQ: You know my planet? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. I visited there twelve years ago, while commanding the
Stargazer.

[Data's quarters]

(The senior officer's floating poker game is in
session) 
RIKER: Five, and twenty. 
LAFORGE: Ouch. 
TROI: If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking, I'm thinking. 
(The doorbell rings) 
DATA: Enter. 
PICARD 2: Counsellor, gentlemen. Forgive this intrusion. I was just
passing by. 
DATA: You are always welcome, Captain. 
PICARD 2: I was wondering, Mister La Forge. What's our engine
efficiency status? 
LAFORGE: Operating at ninety three percent, sir. 
PICARD 2: That's very good, but I would like to increase the efficiency
to ninety five percent. 
LAFORGE: No problem, Captain, I'll get right on it. 
PICARD 2: That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want to
disrupt your recreation. 
LAFORGE: No Captain, it's no problem. Lady Luck left me long ago. 
(La Forge leaves) 
TROI: Would you care to join us, Captain? We have an opening. 
PICARD 2: I'd rather just observe, if you don't mind. 
RIKER: Not at all. Counsellor, twenty. 
(She and Data see Riker's bid) 
RIKER: Pair of threes. 
TROI: Flush. Queen high. 
DATA: That beats my fours. 
PICARD 2: Well played, Counsellor. May I have a word with you for just
a moment? 
TROI: Certainly, sir. 
PICARD 2: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in a
moment.

[Corridor]

PICARD 2: Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about the
crew. How are they reacting to our sudden change in course? 
TROI: I sense no unusual reaction, Captain. After all, such a change is
hardly out of the ordinary. 
PICARD 2: They're not curious or concerned as to why? 
TROI: They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. 
PICARD 2: How far do you think that trust goes? 
TROI: Sir? 
PICARD 2: I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had full
confidence in me. But what if it were to change? 
TROI: Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Counsellor.

[Holding cell]

ESOQQ: My given name is Esoqq. It means fighter. 
THOLL: I'll bet half the names in the Chalnoth language mean fighter. 
ESOQQ: Mizarians. Your names all mean surrender. 
THOLL: We are a peaceful race, a race of thinkers. 
ESOQQ: A race of cowards. And you? I don't know your people. 
HARO: I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine. 
ESOQQ: Who would want to imprison a child? 
HARO: I'm not a child. 
PICARD: Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy.
Someone with a reason for confining us here. 
ESOQQ: There are Chalnoth who would kill me if they could. But kidnap?
There is no reason. 
PICARD: You have many enemies? 
ESOQQ: None of consequence. I've slain all the ones who mattered. That
shocks you, Bolian? 
HARO: A little. 
ESOQQ: And you? 
THOLL: I'm not surprised. I've heard about your race. You're
uncivilised. You have no laws, no system of government 
ESOQQ: The Chalnoth have no use for laws or governments! We are strong.
We obey no one. 
THOLL: You live in anarchy, murdering one another, That mentality may
get us all killed. 
ESOQQ: And you may be the first. 
PICARD: Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. 
THOLL: Neither is asking us useless questions, Picard. But, if you must
pursue the topic, How long have you and the Romulans been adversaries? 
PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing to
entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans.
But what would the Romulans want with you? 
THOLL: My brainpower, perhaps. It's well known that my species
possesses superior intelligence and I am considered among the brightest
of my people. 
HARO: And the least modest. 
ESOQQ: What is this? 
PICARD: Food. 
ESOQQ: The only food? 
PICARD: It would seem so. 
ESOQQ: Poison! 
THOLL: Does this mean there's nothing here for you to eat? 
ESOQQ: You. 
THOLL: Don't even think that! Picard, you won't let him 
PICARD: Esoqq, how long can you go without food? 
ESOQQ: Three days. Perhaps four. 
PICARD: No longer? 
ESOQQ: No longer.
