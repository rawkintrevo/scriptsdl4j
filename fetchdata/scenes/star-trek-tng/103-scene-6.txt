(Another group of frozen people just lounging
about. Some are in a state of undress) 
LAFORGE: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge in the crew quarters. Something in
here. 
(He finds a door which is trying to close. He opens it and a corpse
falls out into his arms.

[Tsiolkovsky]

RIKER: Riker to Captain, I have a report for you,
sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard here. 
RIKER: They're all dead. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Apparently some of them were apparently
blown out the emergency hatches. 
PICARD: But there were eighty people on that ship, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes sir. 
[Tsiolkovsky]

RIKER: As I said, all dead.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading the
research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I am
concerned at being in such close orbit, but the Tsiolkovsky's research
records will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse.

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: I can't find anything unusual in any of
the tricorder readings they've sent over, Captain. 
PICARD: Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria?
Delusion? 
TROI: Any or all, Captain. 
PICARD: All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporter
to maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observation
when they're here.
