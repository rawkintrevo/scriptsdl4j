[Holding cell]

GUEST2: I hope you're satisfied, Picard. You've
accomplished nothing. 
GUEST1: The sound of your voice is beginning to anger me. 
PICARD: Well, I think this charade has gone far enough. (to Haro) Don't
you? 
GUEST3: I don't understand. 
PICARD: Oh yes, you do. This isn't a holding cell. It's a laboratory
maze, a carefully structured test. It's an experiment to see how well
we react under pressure. 
GUEST1: How do you know? 
PICARD: It's the only explanation. Look at the four of us. We do have
something in common. We all react differently to authority. You, the
collaborator, defer to whoever has control. You, the anarchist, reject
authority in any form. I, a Starfleet Captain, trained to command. And
you, a Starfleet cadet, sworn to obey a superior officer's authority.
Our captors have placed us here and have devised obstacles for us to
overcome. They give us food which Esoqq can't eat, to make him a
threat. They give us a door we can't open until the four of us
co-operate. And each time we succeed, they deal us reverses to set us
against each other again, while you observe our reactions. 
GUEST3: Sir, I've been trying to help. 
PICARD: I found it unlikely that a first year cadet would know of the
Enterprise's visit to Mintaka Three, so I tested you. Starfleet has
classified the Cor Caroli Five plague as secret. No cadet would have
knowledge of that incident. 
GUEST3: Captain. 
PICARD: So you may as well drop this pretence. I'm not playing any
further. I'm quitting the game. As far as I am concerned, this
experiment is over! 
GUEST3: You are correct, Captain Picard. 
(And she morphs into three balls of light which then become three
identical aliens with the same voice) 
GUEST0 1: To further our knowledge of alien interaction, we borrowed
you, Tholl, and Esoqq, and replaced you with replicas. 
GUEST1: Replicas? 
GUEST0 2: Our transporter is able to replicate living matter, including
the brain's many trillion dendritic connections where memory is stored.

GUEST2: You mean there's a copy of me on Mizar Two? 
PICARD: An impostor running my ship. 
GUEST0 2: No longer. Commander Riker has taken charge of the Enterprise.

GUEST0 1: Our species is telepathically linked. We are all in continual
contact. 
GUEST0 2: Much more efficient than your primitive vocal communications. 
GUEST0 1: We would like to pursue this study, but of course your
awareness of it would taint the results. 
GUEST0 2: We will therefore return you to your places of origin.
