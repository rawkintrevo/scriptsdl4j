[Transporter room]

MARLA: Chief O'Brien, Jeremy and I are going down
to the surface. 
(She and Jeremy get on the pads as Picard and Troi arrive) 
PICARD: Who are you? 
MARLA: I'm Marla Aster. 
JEREMY: It's my mother, Captain. She's alive. 
PICARD: What do you want? 
MARLA: To take my child down to the planet. 
PICARD: I cannot permit that. The boy is my responsibility. 
MARLA: I'm here to care for him. He needs me. Why do you resist? 
PICARD: Because I don't know who or what you are. 
JEREMY: Can't you see who it is, Captain? 
PICARD: Jeremy, she appears to be your mother, but she is not. 
JEREMY: What do you mean? 
MARLA: You're confusing the boy. 
(Worf grabs Jeremy and takes him off the transporter pad) 
JEREMY: Hey! Wait! Stop! No! No! Wait! Stop! 
(Marla vanishes) 
JEREMY: Mom! Mom? 
TROI: Jeremy 
JEREMY: Wait a minute. Let go of me. She was right there! 
[Corridor]

JEREMY: What did you do to her? 
TROI: Jeremy, I don't know what that was, but it was not your mother. 
JEREMY: You saw her. She was here. 
TROI: Your mother's dead. 
JEREMY: But I touched her. She was real. 
TROI: Why would your real mother want you to go down to the planet?
There's nothing there but dust and rocks.

[Aster home]

(Jeremy's quarters have been transformed) 
JEREMY: It's my house. It's my house on Earth. 
MARLA: Exactly the way it was. Remember, Jeremy? 
JEREMY: How did you do it? 
MARLA: Does it matter? 
TROI: Yes, it matters. 
MARLA: I am trying to understand your resistance. You spoke of rocks
and dust on the planet. I decided to show you what awaits us there. 
TROI: Why would you create this fantasy? 
MARLA: It's his home. And it makes you happy, doesn't it? 
TROI: But it's not real. 
MARLA: Isn't it? Jeremy, isn't that really Patches? 
(suddenly there is a kitten on the blanket, washing itself) 
JEREMY: He knows me. It's him. It's real. It's all real. 
TROI: No, it's not. Could your real mother just make all this appear?
You must not stay here. Come with me. 
JEREMY: I can't.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Is the boy in any danger? 
TROI [OC]: I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. 
PICARD: Help him? 
[Aster home]

TROI: By easing his pain. She's very confused by
our resistance, Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremy
from his cabin? 
TROI: He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend taking him
