HICKMAN [on monitor]: One to transport. 
LAFORGE: Computer, delete the audio. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. Freeze visual. Whose shadow is that? 
COMPUTER: Please restate question. 
LAFORGE: Computer, the shadow currently displayed in section B three,
what is its source? 
COMPUTER: Unknown. 
LAFORGE: Come on, it's got to belong to somebody. Computer, replay a
visual of the last time index. No audio, and slow to fifty percent.
Okay, Brevelle's behind the camera ,Susanna and I head off in that
direction. Mendez moves off that way. Freeze visual. Now, magnify four
times, and spectrally enhance those shadows. (there's the other shadow
in the background) Computer, do you have sufficient data to compile a
holographic simulation of this visual record? 
COMPUTER: A simulation would be limited to areas scanned by the visual
recording device. 
LAFORGE: Good, fine. Scan the entire record and then recreate it on
holodeck three.
