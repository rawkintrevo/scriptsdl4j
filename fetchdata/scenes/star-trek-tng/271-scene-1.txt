  [Sickbay]

(It's busy in Sickbay, minor injuries everywhere.) 
OGAWA: So why were you rolling around in Cypirion cactus? 
RIKER: You know Rebecca Smith? 
OGAWA: The new Tactical officer? 
RIKER: We took a walk in the Arboretum. We sat down, we got
comfortable, things got a little romantic, and then I rolled over. 
(Riker has wicked long spines sticking out of his back. Ogawa starts
pulling them out.) 
BARCLAY: Blurred vision, dizziness, palpitations, a stinging sensation
in the lower spine. It's Terrelian Death Syndrome, isn't it. 
CRUSHER: I thought we agreed you'd come to me before checking Starfleet
Medical Database. 
BARCLAY: Yes, well, this time I'm glad I did. Maybe we can stop the
cellular decay before it's too late. 
CRUSHER: Reg, you don't have Terrelian Death Syndrome. 
BARCLAY: You, you're sure? 
CRUSHER: I'm sure. 
BARCLAY: (scans himself) Then maybe it is Symbalene blood burn. 
CRUSHER: No, no. I don't see anything wrong with you at all. Wait a
minute, there is a slight imbalance in your K three cell count. 
BARCLAY: My K threes? Oh, no. 
CRUSHER: Barclay, I'm sure it's nothing. Look, I'll run a microcellular
scan. We'll see. This'll take a couple of minutes. 
(enter Data carrying something in his arms) 
CRUSHER: How's my smallest patient doing? 
DATA: I believe she is doing well. Her appetite has increased by seven
percent, and she is starting to engage in prenatal behaviour. 
(Spot is put down on a biobed) 
CRUSHER: Oh, she's getting close. You'll have a fresh litter of hungry
kittens before the week is over. Let me just run an amniotic scan to
make sure everything's fine and then I'll 
BARCLAY: Doctor! My capillaries are shrinking! 
CRUSHER: Excuse me. Alyssa, can you take care of Spot for a minute?
Start a preliminary amniotic scan. 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. 
BARCLAY: My intravascular pressure, it's going right through the roof. 
CRUSHER: You're right, it is elevated. You've also got heightened
electrophoretic activity. 
BARCLAY: Electrophoretic activity? Is it serious? 
CRUSHER: Well, based on this, I'd say you've got seventy, maybe eighty
years. 
BARCLAY: Eighty? Eighty years? 
CRUSHER: Yes, Reg. What you've got a mild case of Urodelan Flu. It's
nothing serious. Most humans have a natural immunity to it, but the
T-cell in your DNA that would normally fight off the infection is
dormant. 
BARCLAY: So you mean I have bad genes? 
CRUSHER: You have one dormant gene out of a hundred thousand, and I can
activate that gene with a synthetic T-cell let the body attack the
infection naturally. You should feel better in a couple of days. 
BARCLAY: Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better. 
CRUSHER: Good. Now, stay away from Medical Database. (to Riker) And you
stay out of the Arboretum. 
OGAWA: Everything looks fine, Data. Do you want to know the sex of the
kittens? 
DATA: I have noticed that many humans prefer not to know in order to
experience the surprise during birth. I believe I will preserve the
mystery until then. 
OGAWA: I know what you mean. I don't want to know either. 
CRUSHER: Alyssa? 
OGAWA: Spot's not the only one who's going to be a mother. 
CRUSHER: Oh, Alyssa, that's wonderful! How did Andrew take the news? 
OGAWA: He was a little shocked, but he's getting over it. 
DATA: I have spent the past nine weeks as an expectant parent. I would
be happy to share my insights with your husband. If my experience is
any indication, he will need all the help he can get.

field tests of our new tactical systems and weapon upgrades. Mister
Worf is supervising the exercises.
