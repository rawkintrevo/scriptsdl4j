WORF: The next test will involve the new photon
torpedoes. The explosive yield has been increased by eleven percent and
I have enhanced the targeting system for increased accuracy. 
PICARD: Sounds fascinating, Mister Worf. Please proceed. 
WORF: Setting targeting coordinates zero zero five mark three one
seven, spread pattern delta nine four. Torpedoes armed and loaded, sir.

PICARD: Fire when ready. 
(only two of the three find their targets in the asteroid belt) 
RIKER: Worf? 
WORF: One of the torpedoes has veered off course. It appears to be a
malfunction in the guidance system. 
PICARD: Abort and destroy. 
WORF: The torpedo is not responding. Subspace detonator will not
engage. 
RIKER: Lock on phasers. 
WORF: The torpedo is out of range. 
RIKER: Even for your newly improved phasers? 
PICARD: Maintain a sensor lock on the torpedo, Mister Worf. We'll have
to go after it. 
DATA: That would be inadvisable, sir. The asteroid field is unusually
dense. The Enterprise is too large to safely navigate through it. 
PICARD: Then I'll take a shuttlecraft and retrieve it. Mister Data,
you're with me. 
RIKER: Captain, the shuttle pilot who's on duty is Lieutenant Hayes. 
PICARD: I happen to be a reasonably qualified pilot, Number One.
Besides, these tests hardly require the Captain's personal attention. 
RIKER: Understood. Enjoy yourself. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I think that you should consider analysing your
new guidance system. 
DATA: Captain, I will need a few minutes to attend to a personal
matter.
