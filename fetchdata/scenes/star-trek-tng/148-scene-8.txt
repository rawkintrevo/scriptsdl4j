RIKER: Over here, Doctor. 
PULASKI: Fill me in. 
RIKER: I was walking along minding my own business, doing a simple
geological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. 
PULASKI: Any pain? 
RIKER: No. Just a little numb, that's all. 
PULASKI: Do you know what it was that stuck you? 
LAFORGE: We've been looking for it. No luck. 
PULASKI: Well, whatever it was, it left something behind. I'm going to
take you up to Sickbay. O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski.
