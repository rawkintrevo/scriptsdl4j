(Wesley dashes in and takes his seat) 
RIKER: Ensign, our position. 
WESLEY: Approaching one million kilometres from the neutron star, sir. 
RIKER: Slow to one third impulse power. 
STUBBS: (wearing the C24 equivalent of corduroy) Spectacular, isn't it,
my young friend? 
WESLEY: Yes sir. 
STUBBS: Over and over again, the intense gravitational pull of the
little neutron star sucks up the star material from the red giant, and
it builds up on the surface until it explodes, every one hundred and
ninety six years. Like clockwork. And it is but eighteen hours away. 
DATA: Eighteen hours, seven minutes, and ten seconds, Doctor. 
STUBBS: The interstellar counterpart to Earth's Old Faithful. The only
predictable burst of energy in the universe that can accomplish our
goal. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you would like to make one final inspection
of the unit. 
STUBBS: Captain, I've been inspecting the Egg for the last twenty
years. You may lay it when ready. 
PICARD: Begin launch sequence. 
RIKER: Shuttlebay two, stand-by to launch the Egg. 
[Shuttlebay]

CREWMAN: Standing by, Commander.

DATA: Five minutes to launch site. 
(There's a sudden jolt. Stubbs gets thrown against a bulkhead) 
PICARD: Stabilise. 
WESLEY: The ship isn't responding, sir. 
PICARD: Engineering. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Report, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Checking for failure of inertial dampeners. Instruments say
they're working
