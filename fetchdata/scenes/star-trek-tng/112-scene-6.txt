[Ready room]

CRUSHER: All the medical information the Admiral
provided is satisfactory, sir. 
PICARD: Excellent, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Except for one thing. The test results he gave me aren't two
days old, they're two months old. The medical file coder always
includes the date as part of the file number. He lied to me, sir, and I
don't know why. 
PICARD: He is eighty five years old, Doctor. For some, the memory
begins to fail. 
CRUSHER: He suffers from Iverson's Disease, sir. It affects the body,
not the mind. No, I have a gut feeling he's hiding something. 
PICARD: That is an observation I'd expect from Counsellor Troi. Doctor.
Doctor, I do respect your opinion, and I'll want you on the Bridge for
the next day or so. The Admiral must remain in the best of health for
these negotiations, and he might require your services.

PICARD: Admiral, we're approaching the Idini Star
Cluster. Would you like to take the conn as we make transit? 
JAMESON: Thank you, Captain. I would. 
(And he gets out of his wheelchair and walks a little unsteadily down
the slope to Geordi's station) 
PICARD: Well, Admiral, quite a little surprise you've pulled on us. 
CRUSHER: Yes, quite. 
JAMESON: Neglected to mention I began some new therapy before I left.
Seems to be working. I haven't felt this good since the last time I was
in space. The Gettysburg. All I needed to get me out of that chair was
the thought of walking the decks in command of a starship again. 
PICARD: Admiral, you only have the conn temporarily. 
JAMESON: A figure of speech. Of course she's your ship. I'll just keep
an eye on her for a while.
