WESLEY RIKER DATA WORF

[Shuttlebay]

RIKER: Did they send the right shuttle? 
DATA: Yes, sir. It matches Commander Worf's quantum signature
precisely. I have remodulated the shuttle's engines to emit an inverse
warp field. You will need to activate the field at the precise moment
you enter the fissure. 
WORF: Assuming it works, will I find myself near my own ship? 
DATA: That is one possibility. However, the uncertainty principle
dictates that time is a variable in this equation. You may end up
several days before the event or several days after. There is no way to
tell. 
WORF: I understand. 
RIKER: Good luck. 
(Data and Riker leave.Worf and Deanna embrace, then kiss) 
[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Setting course for the fissure. 
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Captain, the shuttlecraft is under attack. 
RIKER: The Bajorans again. 
WESLEY: No, sir. It's one of the Enterprises. They're hailing us. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(a bad signal and a Riker with a full ragged beard) 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: We won't go back. You don't know what it's like
in our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We're
one of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us! 
RIKER: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything will
return to 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: No, we won't go back! 
(transmission ends) 
WESLEY: Sir, they're firing on the shuttlecraft. 
RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them. 
WESLEY: Direct hit. Their shields have collapsed. Their engine core is
overloading. 
(KaBOOM) 
RIKER: What happened? 
WESLEY: It looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage. Their
warp containment field must have been weak. 
RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg. 
DATA: Captain, Worf is entering the fissure.
