KORRIS RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD KONMEL CRUSHER

[Bridge]

PICARD: Tasha, go to transporter room three. I want
you there when the away team returns. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
[Batris Corridor]

LAFORGE: Commander, we are out of time. This ship
is blowing. 
RIKER: Transporter room, have you got a lock on us? 
[Transporter room]

TASHA: Too much interference. You have to get
farther away from the Engineering section.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Engineering section is critical.
Destruction of the Batris is imminent. 
PICARD: They're out of options. Do it!

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Now! 
(The first attempt fails and the group arrive back on the Batris as
explosions head towards them. The ship goes bang on the viewscreen,
then Tasha materialises them) 
RIKER: Bridge, this is Commander Riker. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: We are taking the survivors to Sickbay.

PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. 
WORF: Captain. Request permission to join you. 
PICARD: Granted.

[Sickbay]

WORF: Debris is still being analysed. 
PICARD: Inform me as soon as it is complete. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Situation, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: His injuries are very critical. 
PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard, Captain of this vessel. 
KORRIS: My name is Korris, Captain of the Klingon Defence Force. This
is Lieutenant Konmel. 
PICARD: Would you mind telling me what has happened? 
KORRIS: We were passengers. The Talarians were taking us to outpost M
Zed Five. 
PICARD: What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? 
KORRIS: We were attacked without warning by a Ferengi cruiser. During
the course of the battle we must have unknowingly entered the Neutral
Zone. 
WORF: The weapons were not Ferengi. 
KORRIS: What is your name? 
WORF: I am Lieutenant Worf. 
KORRIS: And you are a member of this crew? 
WORF: Yes. 
KORRIS: You are correct. The weapons were Klingon, but the vessel was
Ferengi. 
PICARD: What precipitated the attack? 
KORRIS: I don't know. We were in our quarters. 
KONMEL: The captain of the freighter had no combat experience so he did
not anticipate the first attack, which was nearly fatal. 
KORRIS: We took control with his permission. The Ferengi called for
surrender. I told the Captain to agree to all their terms. We had only
one chance, but I was confident it would be enough. 
KONMEL: As adversaries the Ferengi are not very worthy. 
WORF: Still, your weapons were limited and their ship superior. 
KORRIS: Yes. All we had was an ancient battery of Merculite rockets.
Our only chance was to trick them into lowering their shields. 
KONMEL: We reduced power and lured them in. 
KORRIS: They suspected nothing. 
KONMEL: Then, when they lowered their shields to beam over a boarding
party, we opened fire. 
PICARD: Still, there are some points that I'm not very clear about. 
KORRIS: Captain, we are hungry and tired. 
PICARD: Of course. 
KORRIS: If there is anything else you wish to know about this incident,
we will be available. 
WORF: Permission to show our guests to their quarters, Captain. 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
(Worf, Korris and Konmel leave) 
RIKER: What do you think, Captain? 
PICARD: There's more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarian
ship so far off course? What was its point of departure? 
RIKER: Why would three Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken down
freighter? 
PICARD: Contact Starfleet. Find out what they know about Korris and
company. 
RIKER: It'll take forty eight hours for a message to get to Starfleet
on subspace frequency. 
PICARD: They're going to be with us for a while. Let's find out all we
can about them. 
RIKER: Do you think I should have assigned a security team to keep an
eye on our guests? 
PICARD: No. Worf can deal with anything that might arise. How's your
patient, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Not good. I'll keep you posted.
