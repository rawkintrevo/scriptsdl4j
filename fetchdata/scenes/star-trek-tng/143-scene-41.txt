SONYA: Are you sure he can do it, sir? Geordi's an
engineer, not a weapons specialist. 
RIKER: If anyone can improvise, it's Geordi. 
SONYA: What makes you think the Pakleds even have that kind of gear on
board? 
DATA: Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. The
timing will be crucial. Geordi must correctly interpret our intentions.

RIKER: Geordi's up to speed. I trust his instincts. 
DATA: The Pakleds did hear our little fiction about Geordi's weapons
knowledge. 
RIKER: Exactly. And since they equate intelligence with strength, they
won't pass up the chance to use that knowledge. Can you do it? 
SONYA: Count on it. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker! 
RIKER: Go ahead, Bridge.
