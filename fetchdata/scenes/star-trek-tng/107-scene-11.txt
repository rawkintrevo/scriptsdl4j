TROI: It's getting much, much colder, sir. How far down is it likely to
go? 
PICARD: A lot. Even in orbital space it'll get below minus two hundred
degrees. 
CRUSHER: We won't have to worry much past minus seventy or so. 
PICARD: Feels like that right now. Good. Thank you.

LETEK: If he moves, kill him. 
MORDOC: Letek, has what we've done broken our agreement with their
captain? 
LETEK: We will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us. It will be

badge) It looks like gold. Tastes like gold. 
RIKER: It is gold. 
(Renewed thunder and lightning makes the Ferengi try to cover their

LETEK: Accursed planet! 
RIKER: It's nothing compared to what our Captain will do when he finds

RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, First Officer of the USS
Enterprise. You have a lot to learn.

WORF: Pygmy cretins! 
LETEK: Kill them. 
MORDOC: Hideous monsters! 
TASHA: No! (they stop) Good, you've heard of phasers. Now, over there. 
MORDOC: Is this a female? 
KAYRON: A human female, Letek? 
LETEK: Yes, it is true. You work with females, arm them, and force them
to wear clothing. 
MORDOC: Sickening.
