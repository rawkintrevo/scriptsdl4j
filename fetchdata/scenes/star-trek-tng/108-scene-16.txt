RIKER: These weapons were taken from two of your
people who were loitering out of sight in the vicinity of the Selay
delegation quarters. Would you care to explain, sir? 
ANTICAN: These are not weapons, First Officer. They are tools. We use
these to dispatch the animals we consume. 
TASHA: Your food supply is not on the same deck as the Selay
delegation, sir. 
RIKER: And you have to admit that these could kill. 
ANTICAN: I admit some of my people are impulsive. and we all have
reason to hate the Selay. 
TASHA: They appear to have the same feelings about you, sir. 
ANTICAN: The nature of politics. 
RIKER: Nevertheless, Chief Delegate, you're on notice that all of your
weapons, no matter what their basic function, are being confiscated.
Violence will not be tolerated on the Enterprise. 
ANTICAN: Of course not. And if any does occur, let me assure you it
will not be we Anticans who start it. 
TASHA: Thank you, sir. 
(Riker and Tasha leave) 
ANTICAN: But we will finish it.
