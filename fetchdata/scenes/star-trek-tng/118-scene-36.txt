[Transporter room]

(Riker and Data get on the pads) 
RIKER: We're ready, Lieutenant Worf. 
[Bridge]

RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, you may come down
now to conclude our discussions, or your ship may leave. It's your
choice. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations.

(They are beamed away) 
WORF: Transporter room, now!

[Aldean corridor]

(Data and Riker arrive safely and head off into) 
[Custodian room]

DATA: This is it, Commander. It is programmed to
accept only authorised voice command. 
RIKER: There's no way we can override. 
DATA: No, but I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. 
[First Unit]

RADUE: Before we begin, Captain, you must speak
with the children. It seems they are on some sort of strike. I don't
understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm not very good with

(Picard beams in) 
KATIE: Hi, Captain Picard. 
HARRY: Hi, Captain. 
WESLEY: Sir, I knew you'd come. 
PICARD: It's not over yet, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I think I figured out their computer controls, sir, but I'm not
sure. It's a much different system than ours. 
PICARD: Good, Wesley. Now 
HARRY: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Harry. 
HARRY: If something happens and you have to leave us here, will you
tell my Dad that I'm sorry that I made him angry, and that I miss him. 
PICARD: You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much I
admire his son. Hello, Alexandra. 
ALEXANDRA: (Arms open for picking up) Hi. 
(So he does, uncomfortably, while she hangs on to her pet tribble. Did
I mention that before?)
