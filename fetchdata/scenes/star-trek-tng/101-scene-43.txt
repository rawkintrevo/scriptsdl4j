orbital city shielding ferengi exactly doesn computer enterprise data

[Bridge]

PICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. You
mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: But we have had no dealings with them. It was
only a, a thought. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Are you certain? 
ZORN [OC]: I promise you, Captain. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: We were making an empty threat. I wanted your
cooperation. Forgive me. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir. 
SECURITY: (at Tasha's station) It measures twelve times our volume,
Captain. 
(A purple light envelopes the Enterprise) 
WORF: Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.

[Passageway]

TASHA: Pain again? 
RIKER: Troi, you've been at it enough. 
TROI: No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. 
DATA: Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. 
TROI: Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someone
doesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. 
RIKER: Come on, let's get to the surface.

[Bridge]

WORF: There is no computer record of any such
vessel, sir. Nothing even close. 
SECURITY: Still no response, sir. We've done everything but threaten
them. 
PICARD: Sensor scans, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Our sensor signals seem to just bounce off. Something's
happening, sir. They're firing on Farpoint, sir! 
PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready! 
WORF: Wait, sir. They're hitting the old Bandi city, not Farpoint
Station. 
(The ruined and empty city is being smashed by purple blasts)
