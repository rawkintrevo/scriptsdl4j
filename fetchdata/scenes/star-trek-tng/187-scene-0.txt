  [Ebenezer
Scrooge's bedchamber] 
 (It's Dickens time on the holodeck, and Data is
playing Scrooge) 
MARLEY: You don't believe in me. 
DATA: I don't. 
MARLEY: What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your
senses? 
DATA: I don't know. 
MARLEY: Why do you doubt your senses? 
DATA: Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the
stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot
of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. Why,
there's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are.
Humbug, I tell you. Humbug. 
(the ghost roars, and Scrooge cowers) 
PICARD: Freeze programme. Very well done, Data. Your performance skills
really are improving. 
DATA: Your courtesy is appreciated, sir. But I am aware that I do not
effectively convey the fear called for in this scene. 
PICARD: Well, you've never known fear, Data. But as an acute observer
of behaviour, you should be able to approximate it. 
DATA: Sir, that is not an appropriate basis for an effective
performance. Not by the standards set by my mentors. 
PICARD: Your mentors? 
DATA: Yes, sir. I have studied the philosophies of virtually every
known acting master. I find myself attracted to Stanislavsky, Adler,
Garnav. Proponents of an acting technique known as the Method.
