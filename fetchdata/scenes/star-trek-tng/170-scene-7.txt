[Fajo's den]

(Data is feeding the lapling when Fajo enters) 
GUEST1: You are still wearing that uniform. Why? 
DATA: I am a Starfleet officer. 
GUEST1: You are not in Starfleet any longer. It's time you adjusted your
programme
to accept reality. 
DATA: Even if I chose to do so, it is doubtful that my programming
could be sufficiently altered to accede to your wishes. 
GUEST1: Oh? 
DATA: I have been designed with a fundamental respect for life in all
its forms and a strong inhibition against causing harm to living
beings. 
GUEST1: What a marvellous contradiction. A military pacifist. Tell me,
whose dreadful decision was it to enlist you in Starfleet to begin
with? 
DATA: My skills seemed appropriate 
GUEST1: Data, Data, Data. Big mistake. A grievous error. You belong in
Starfleet about as much as I belong in a verbal contract. Tell me, have
you killed yet? 
DATA: No, but I am programmed with the ability to use deadly force in
the cause of defense. 
GUEST1: Shame on you. Shame on you. How neatly you rationalise your
capabilities. How can you just casually accept your role in murder? 
DATA: I would not participate in murder. Perhaps you misunderstand. 
GUEST1: Can't you see how much better it will be for you right here? The
intellectual rewards alone. Our personal exploration of the
galaxy. I am at war with no one. I am your liberator. 
DATA: You are a fine debater, sir. It is a pity you have used your
verbal gifts for mere hucksterism and the advancement of your own
greed. 
GUEST1: Perhaps. Perhaps you would not judge me so harshly if you knew of
my desperate youth, wasted, wasted on the streets of Zimballia. 
DATA: Your past does not excuse unethical or immoral behaviour, sir. 
GUEST1: Well, it doesn't matter. It isn't true anyway. My father was
quite wealthy, actually. He was a thief. Data, why don't you put on
these lovely new clothes and sit on the chair. 
DATA: I must decline. 
GUEST1: You are going to be much more of a challenge than I had first
thought. (goes to replicator) Finoplak, one hundred denkirs. (A vial of
liquid appears) Now, Data, in the meantime, here is something for your
logic circuits to analyse. 
(Fajo thrown the liquid onto Data's uniform, which begins to smoke and
dissolve) 
GUEST1: Oh, don't worry. The solvent won't harm your, your skin. But in
seconds it will completely dissolve that uniform. Personally, I'd be
delighted to see you go around naked. I assume you have no modesty.
But, then, I guess that decency is the rule of your Starfleet training.
In any case, Data, why don't you make a decision about which
alternative you dislike the least. Make a decision by dinnertime
tonight. I have invited a guest to meet you, and I expect you to be as
entertaining with him as you have been with me.
