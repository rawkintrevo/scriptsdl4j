[Ready room]

AMANDA: Kill me? But why? 
PICARD: They're not convinced that you are fully Q. And they are also
responsible for your parent's death. 
AMANDA: My parents? But what right do they have? Q? Answer me. Are you
afraid to face me? 
Q: She's such a plucky little thing, now, isn't she. I really do enjoy
you, you know. 
PICARD: Amanda's question deserves an answer, Q. You've made yourself
judge, jury, and if necessary executioner. By what right have you
appointed yourself to this position? 
Q: Superior morality. 
PICARD: Yes. I recall how you used your superior morality when we first
encountered you. You put us on trial for the crimes of humanity. 
Q: The jury is still out on that, Picard, make no mistake. 
PICARD: Your arrogant pretence at being the moral guardians of the
universe strikes me as being hollow, Q. I see no evidence that you are
guided by a superior moral code, or any code whatsoever. You may be
nearly omnipotent, and I don't deny that your parlour tricks are very
impressive, but morality? I don't see it. I don't acknowledge it, Q. I
would put human morality against the Q's any day. And perhaps that's
the reason that we fascinate you so. Because our puny behaviour shows
you a glimmer of the one thing that evades your omnipotence, a moral
centre. And if so, I can think of no crueller irony than that you
should destroy this young woman, whose only crime is that she's too
human. 
Q: Jean-Luc, sometimes I think the only reason I come here is to listen
to these wonderful speeches of yours. But this time, your concern is
unwarranted. We've decided not to harm her. And we're prepared to offer
her a choice. 
AMANDA: What kind of choice? 
Q: You can either come to the Continuum with me 
AMANDA: Or? 
Q: Now this choice is more difficult. You have it within yourself the
ability to refrain from using the power of Q. If you can do that, you
can stay here. 
AMANDA: Then I'm staying here. 
Q: Think about this. This is not so easy. Your parents were given this
choice and they were unable to resist the temptation of using their
power. 
AMANDA: All I've wanted since this whole thing began is to become a
normal human being again. I know I can resist. 
WORF [OC]: Worf to Picard. There is an emergency message from Commander
Riker. 
PICARD: I'm on my way.
