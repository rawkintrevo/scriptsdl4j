[Lounge]

GUEST0: We've talked it over, Captain, and the
ceremony will be tomorrow if you agree. And Captain, would it be
possible for you to perform the ceremony? 
PICARD: Well, yes, of course, if all parties request it. 
LWAXANA: All parties do not request it. It's simply out of the
question. I'm sorry, Captain, but unfortunately you are not practiced
in the ways of Betazed joining. 
PICARD: No, that's quite true. 
LWAXANA: Therefore you are totally unqualified. 
GUEST0: He is qualified to lead a traditional Earth ceremony, which
is what this will be. 
LWAXANA: I thought you had no sense of humour. Earth wedding?
Ridiculous! 
GUEST0: My family and I are living on Earth now. 
LWAXANA: So, that's why you want that backward ritual. Terrible,
Captain, to see a woman go downhill like this. 
TROI: Mother! 
GUEST0: Downhill? 
LWAXANA: The matter is settled. Mister Homn will conduct the joining. 
GUEST2: But Homn can't even talk! 
LWAXANA: No matter, he is highly adept in the acts of sign language.
The matter is closed. 
GUEST0: Who are you to tell us what we should do? 
LWAXANA: Your ignorance is astonishing. I am Lwaxana Troi. Daughter of
The Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy
Rings of Betazed. Who are you? 
PICARD: Ladies and gentlemen, it is a Starfleet tradition that at
social gatherings, disputes are not permitted. I hereby declare
therefore all disagreements resolved. 
(At table, during the meal) 
PICARD: A toast. To the young couple and their families. 
GUEST0: And? 
PICARD: And may this union be a productive one. 
(General hear, hear, and cheers) 
(Data is standing by Mr. Homn, who is standing by a small gong, and
knocking back drinks as if he's spent a month in a desert) 
DATA: Considering the rate at which you imbibe, sir, is your lineage at
all mixed with human? 
(Homn exaggeratedly sticks his nose in the air. Such an insult, young
android) 
GUEST5: Is it true, Captain, that there's a Tarellian ship headed for
Haven? 
(Lwaxana takes a bite of food, Homn strikes the gong. This goes on
during the following conversation and gets on everyone's nerves) 
PICARD: Yes, it is true. 
GUEST5: That's amazing. I've read everything I could about them.
Biological virus analysis was a favourite subject at medical school. 
CRUSHER: In which case I'd very much like to confer with you. I'm
pleased to have a medical colleague aboard. 
GUEST5: Yes, ma'am, Doctor. Would it be possible to prepare some medical
needs, geared toward the Tarellian's probable needs? We could beam it
over without any fear of infection. 
PICARD: What do you think, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: It's a very considerate idea. Our Sickbay is at your disposal,
Doctor. 
GUEST5: Thank you. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: You're circling the room like a buzzard. 
DATA: Perhaps being human yourself, sir, you do not find them as
intriguing as I. 
GUEST0: Must he do that? 
LWAXANA: As you well know, it is the Betazed way of giving thanks for
the food we eat. 
GUEST0: You giving thanks? Besides, you never did this before. 
LWAXANA: I do it now. Unlike some people, I am in growth. 
(The apparently decorative leaf-like thing on her sleeve, shakes at
her) 
LWAXANA: Victoria, I've forgotten whether you enjoy pets or not. 
GUEST0: Love them, of course. 
LWAXANA: Good. 
(So the thing on her sleeve slides over to Victoria Miller, who of
course screams) 
LWAXANA: Gently, gently. Poor baby, did she hurt you? 
RIKER: Captain. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend some time
considering the Tarellian situation 
PICARD: Yes, of course. 
RIKER: Ladies and gentlemen. 
(Riker leaves) 
DATA: Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in the Betazed ceremony you
mentioned. Could you tell us more? 
LWAXANA: Why, I'd be delighted, Commander. It's an ancient ceremony,
widely regarded as the most beautiful in the universe. After the young
couple have removed their clothing 
TASHA: The bride and groom go naked? 
LWAXANA: All guests must go unclothed. It honours the act of love being
celebrated. Oh, you needn't worry too much, dear. Your body's not that
bad. Besides, your husband quite likes the idea of seeing me unclothed.

GUEST0: Steven! 
LWAXANA: You did know he's attracted to me, didn't you? 
GUEST2: Untrue! I don't. 
TROI: Stop this petty bickering, all of you! Especially you, Mother! 
(Troi storms out, knocking over the gong on her way)
DATA: Could you please continue the petty bickering? I find it most
intriguing.
