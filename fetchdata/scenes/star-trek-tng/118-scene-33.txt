CRUSHER: I've got it, Captain. The Aldeans are
suffering from a form of radiation poisoning. 
PICARD: Is that what made the Aldeans sterile? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
PICARD: Is it reversible? 
CRUSHER: With the proper treatment, yes. 
DATA: Captain. 
CRUSHER: Sir. 
DATA: These permutations are going to take a very long time. 
PICARD: How long? 
DATA: Weeks. 
RIKER: There is the option. 
LAFORGE: We were able to further define the weakness in their shield.
Now, it's not a hole as much as it is a fluctuation. 
RIKER: If the timing is precise, it's possible to beam through and onto
the planet. 
PICARD: Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole? 
RIKER: The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater. 
PICARD: All right. You and Data beam down. Locate the power source of
that shield. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans until you're ready.

[Wesley's room]

LEDA: Will you at least eat? 
(She puts the tray on the table and leaves) 
WESLEY: No, Alexandra. 
ALEXANDRA: Why? 
WESLEY: We can't eat. I know you're hungry. We all are. But it's our
way of telling them that we want to go home. Understand? 
ALEXANDRA: Yes. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and Data get on the pads) 
RIKER: We're ready, Lieutenant Worf. 
[Bridge]

RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, you may come down
now to conclude our discussions, or your ship may leave. It's your
choice. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations.

(They are beamed away) 
WORF: Transporter room, now!

[Aldean corridor]
