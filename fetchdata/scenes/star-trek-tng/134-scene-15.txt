MENDON: It is confirmed that the organisms feed on
some of the compounds that make up the hull of the Enterprise. 
PICARD: And the Klingon ship, the Pagh? 
MENDON: They are much more susceptible. Their hull contains more of the
compounds. 
PICARD: Projection. 
DATA: According to the rate of reproduction, there should be a twelve
centimetre opening in the Klingon hull at this time. 
PICARD: Signal them at once. They could be unaware of the danger. They
may need our help. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Change course to intercept. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
DATA: It will take some time to locate them, sir. They are on
undesignated manoeuvres in the Pheben system. 
PICARD: Find them.

KARGAN: Tell me, Commander Riker, what do you make
of this? 
(The hole in their hull is displayed on the viewscreen) 
RIKER: I felt no collision. Were we hit by a small meteor? 
KARGAN: No. No collision. 
RIKER: Corrosion, then? 
KARGAN: No, not corrosion. 
RIKER: Science Station, analyse. 
KARGAN: We already have, and fortunately the cavity opened onto a
section that could withstand the change in pressure. 
RIKER: Then what is it? 
KLAG: A space organism eating away at our hull. 
RIKER: What are you talking about? What is it? I mean, you must have
some way to repair it. 
KARGAN: I'm afraid not. 
KLAG: Our estimate is that in less than eight hours we will have lost
too much of our shell to remain intact. 
KARGAN: The only vessel we've had contact with recently is the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: There was no direct contact with the Enterprise. 
KARGAN: Tactics Officer, report to Commander Riker. 
TACTICS: The Enterprise did conduct an extensive scan of this vessel. 
RIKER: That's normal procedure. 
KARGAN: What type of beam did the Enterprise use to cause this damage
in our hull? 
RIKER: None. Why would they do that? We're allies. 
TACTICS: But my logs indicate that the Enterprise directed an intense
scanning beam at this specific area for a duration of two minutes. 
KARGAN: Explain that. 
RIKER: I can't. 
TACTICS: It could be a weapon. 
RIKER: It's no weapon. The Enterprise has no reason to do that,
especially with me on board. It makes no sense. Why? 
KARGAN: Why is no longer important. What is important is our response
to this attack. Engage cloaking device. Change course to intercept the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: What do you intend to do, Captain? 
KARGAN: Intend? There is only one response. I intend to attack the
Enterprise and destroy it.
