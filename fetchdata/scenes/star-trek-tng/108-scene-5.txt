LAFORGE TASHA PICARD GEORDI CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

TASHA: We're making a close sensor pass on an
unusual object, Geordi. Any problems? 
GEORDI [OC]: Not at all, Lieutenant. All equipment on line and
functioning. 
TASHA: Sensors ready, sir. 
PICARD: Life form reading? 
DATA: No life form reading, sir. 
PICARD: Begin the pass. 
(The Enterprise approaches the blue cloud) 
DATA: Sir, it is changing shape. 
PICARD: Any readings of matter there? 
DATA: Negative, Captain. Energy only. 
(The Enterprise enters the cloud)

[Sensor Maintenance]

(Worf goes over to a wall panel, and puts his pen
device on it. Blue energy goes up his arm and he cries out. Then he is
flung back to the floor) 
LAFORGE: Worf! La Forge to Sickbay. We havd a medical emergency in
sensor maintenance. I repeat, this is a medical emergency. 
(after the titles, Crusher and a medic dash in) 
CRUSHER: What happened? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. He got hit by some sensor feedback, maybe. 
(Worf suddenly wakes up and starts fighting the medic. Geordi lies
across him so Crusher can inject him) 
LAFORGE: You got it, Doc? 
CRUSHER: I got it. Lieutenant Worf, can you hear what I'm saying? Let's
get him up. 
GEORDI: Okay. Come on, big guy. On your feet. Here we go. That's it. 
CRUSHER: (to medic) Are you okay?

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: He was just monitoring the sensor console
when he jerked as though something hit him. What my sensors showed was
a glow, just for a second. I can't explain it. 
PICARD: Could your Visor device have malfunctioned? 
LAFORGE: I doubt it, sir. It seemed what I was seeing was something
real.
