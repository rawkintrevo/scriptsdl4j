DATA: Commander, I'm afraid the only entry we have
on Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. 
RIKER: Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on their
planet. 
CRUSHER: Commander? I've been digging through the medical database from
Acamar Three for hours, and I have found another victim of the same
microvirus that killed Volnoth. But only one. Fifty three years ago, a
Gatherer named Penthor-Mul. 
RIKER: Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? 
DATA: Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was captured
while leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of a
heart attack before his trial ended. 
RIKER: Display Volnoth's birth record again. 
CRUSHER: Lornak. The same clan. 
RIKER: The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from the
same clan. What does that tell us, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: If these microbes were engineered for murder, I'd say somebody
could be going after a whole family. 
DATA: Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also
from the Lornak
clan. 
RIKER: I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarian
blood feuds, and I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemies
were. How could this virus have been transmitted, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: More ways than I can count. And it's perfectly safe to the
carrier as long as he doesn't have the same DNA patterns. 
RIKER: Tailor made for their enemies. 
DATA: Commander, eighty years ago the Lornaks massacred a rival clan,
the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years. 
RIKER: Ended it? 
DATA: According to these records, there were no survivors. The
Tralestas were annihilated. 
CRUSHER: Something tells me they weren't all been wiped out. 
RIKER: There must be a missing link here. 
CRUSHER: Computer, any members of the Acamarian delegation from the
Tralesta clan? 
COMPUTER: Clan affiliation is not within provided records. 
DATA: Sir, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths.
Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. 
(a still image on the monitor) 
RIKER: I don't see the connection. 
DATA: Behind him and to the left, sir. 
RIKER: Computer, scan left and magnify. 
DATA: The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the
face, sir. 
RIKER: Do it. 
(It is Yuta) 

CRUSHER: But that photograph was taken over fifty years ago. 
RIKER: Fifty three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day.
