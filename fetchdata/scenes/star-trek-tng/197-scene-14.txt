PICARD RIKER ODAN WORF

[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: Lieutenant. We'll be entering the upper
ionosphere in two minutes and twenty seconds. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, an unidentified ship is emerging from
the limb of the moon. 
PICARD: Hail the vessel. 
RIKER [OC]: I have visual contact. I don't recognise it. 
WORF: It claims to be an escort vessel from the Beta moon. 
PICARD: There was no mention of an escort. Request a security clearance
code. 
WORF: They do not answer, sir. 
PICARD: Commander Riker, prepare to return to the shuttlebay. 
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged. 
WORF: Captain, they are loading its phaser banks. 
[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: Increasing power to the shields. 
(the ship starts taking pot-shots at them. at least one hits them) 
RIKER: Coming about. 
(Odan is thrown out of his seat and the shuttle is damaged) 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: We've lost port thrusters 
[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losing
control. 
PICARD [OC]: We're bringing you in. 
(the tractor beam grabs them and the other ship veers off) 
RIKER: Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up.
You can't tow us. You'd better beam us directly on board. 
ODAN: No, don't do it. 
RIKER: I can't stabilise the shuttle. 
ODAN: If you transport me, it will kill me. Please. 
PICARD [OC]: Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. 
RIKER: Belay that order, Captain. I'll bring her in manually.
