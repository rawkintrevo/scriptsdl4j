[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: The Captain's team. 
CRUSHER: I'm not going to leave you down there. 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: You pull as many people off the surface as
you can and get back to the transwarp conduit. The Captain's orders
were to get the Enterprise back to Federation space. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: Acknowledged. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker out. 
CRUSHER: Prepare to leave orbit. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg ship is powering up its forward weapons array.
They'll be in firing range in, in twenty seconds. 
CRUSHER: Salazar, how many people do we still have down there? 
SALAZAR [OC]: Seventy three, sir. 
CRUSHER: Put the Borg ship onscreen. 
TAITT: Should I raise shields, sir? 
CRUSHER: Not yet. I want to keep bringing people up until the last
possible second. 
TAITT: Ten seconds. 
CRUSHER: Stand by to raise shields and break orbit on my mark. 
TAITT: Five seconds. 
CRUSHER: Mark. 
(an energy bolt hits) 
TAITT: Shields down to seventy percent. 
CRUSHER: Establish a frequency shift firing pattern and return fire. 
TAITT: Er, right. 
(two torpedoes are fired) 
TAITT: Direct hit, no damage. 
CRUSHER: Helm, set course for the conduit, maximum warp. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg aren't following us. 
CRUSHER: Salazar 
[Transporter room]

CRUSHER [OC]: How many people did we leave behind?

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Riker to any team leader. 
POWELL [OC]: Lieutenant Powell here, sir. 
RIKER: Round up everybody who was left behind. Take cover. Try to avoid
any contact with the Borg. 
POWELL [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Riker out. Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space,
it'll be a few days before Starfleet can get any ships here. Until
then, we're on our own.
