TROI: Tasha? What are you doing? 
TASHA: I need your advice. That's why I came to your quarters. 
TROI: Of course. Anything I can do 
TASHA: On clothes. You always wear such beautiful clothes off duty. And
your hair always looks so nice. I want to change my image. What do you
think about this? Or this one? 
TROI: It's not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain. Yhat
you're fighting something. (their hands touch) What is it? 
TASHA: Never mind. I'll find what I need myself. Ship's stores will

TROI [OC]: Troi to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Sir, I think Tasha's been infected too. 
[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: She just left my quarters, 
PICARD: Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nut
whatever it is, she's got it. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seems
our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. 
DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? 
PICARD: Forget it.
