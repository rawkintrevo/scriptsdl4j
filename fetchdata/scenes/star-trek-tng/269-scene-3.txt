[Troi's quarters]

CRUSHER: Worf says he's going to teach us some
mok'bara throwing techniques today. 
TROI: More like falling techniques. Last time we did that I was sore
for a week. 
CRUSHER: What's this? 
(a three segment column with a rounded stone on top) 
TROI: I have no idea. I've never seen it before. 
CRUSHER: Maybe Will left it for you. A little present? 
TROI: It's not quite his style. 
CRUSHER: Then maybe it's a secret admirer. 
TROI: That's an interesting thought 
CRUSHER: Well, you'll figure it out later. Come on, we're going to be
late. 
(Troi and Crusher leave, and a compass rose appears on the top stone)

TROI: (to a child) That's nice. Data, this is
amazing. How did you come up with this? 
(Data has made a half-face mask with a compass rose motif on the
forehead) 
DATA: I followed your advice, Counsellor. I used my imagination. 
TROI: That's an understatement. 
DATA: For some reason, as I was shaping the clay, the image of the mask
was exceptionally clear in my mind. The design seemed to flow quite
naturally. 
TROI: Data, have you been in my quarters? 
DATA: No, Counsellor. 
TROI: Somebody left an object in my room. Some kind of artefact, and it
has something very similar to this. And you don't know anything about
it? 
DATA: I do not. 
ERIC: Excuse me, Counsellor. Can you help me with my terminal? It's not
working right. 
(the screen shows the mask and alien glyphs) 
DATA: Perhaps we should investigate this matter further.
