thank consumption shuttlebay pocket beam lets understand functioning checks

[Shuttlebay]

LAFORGE: That's it, Commander, everything checks
out. The energy buffer is installed and functioning. I estimate it
should reduce the power drain to your systems by about forty percent. 
RIKER: Any guess how long we'll have? 
LAFORGE: Lets just say you don't want to waste any time once you get in
there. You'll have to give him continuous readouts on energy
consumption. I can't even predict if the drain will be at a constant
rate. 
SOREN: I understand. 
LAFORGE: Then that's it. Commander, I'll monitor you as far as I can,
but once you get inside that pocket you're on your own. 
RIKER: We don't have any idea what condition the shuttle crew is in, so
we'll all beam directly to Sickbay. 
LAFORGE: I'll notify Doctor Crusher to be standing by. 
(Soren and Riker get in the shuttlecraft) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard here. 
LAFORGE: We're ready to initiate shuttle pre-launch sequence.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Proceed, Mister Data. 
DATA: Initiating pre-launch sequence. 
RIKER [OC]: Request flight clearance. 
DATA: Clearance is granted. The shuttle is under way, sir. 
PICARD: Good hunting, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: Thank you, sir. See you for dinner.
