WORF: We are closing on shuttlecraft, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. 
RIKER: Magnify. 
(Definitely a tiny Federation shuttlecraft, tumbling gently in space) 
RIKER: Prepare to lock on tractor beam.

seconds. 
RIKER: Set automatic locking device. Alert Shuttlebay two. 
[Shuttlebay two]

DATA [OC]: Shuttlebay two, prepare for retrieval
procedure. 
[Bridge]

bay door) 
PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: You're with me, Mister Worf. 
PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, you are needed in Shuttlebay two. 
PULASKI [OC]: I've been monitoring. I'm on my way.

[Shuttlebay two]

(Guy Vardeman is on duty here) 
DATA [OC]: Engage secondary tractor beam. 
(The external beam is swapped for an internal one to bring the shuttle
in to land. The markings say NCC-1701-D 05 El Baz. Riker and Worf
enter) 
RIKER: It's a Federation shuttlecraft, all right. 
WORF: Yet there are no Federation bases or vessels in this area. 
RIKER: NCC one seven zero one D USS Enterprise, shuttlecraft five. 
(They look over to a shuttlecraft already parked in the bay. Pulaski
and a medic enter) 
RIKER: NCC one seven zero one D USS Enterprise shuttlecraft five. 
WORF: How is this possible? 
PULASKI: Commander, come here! 
(They gaze at the unconscious pilot of the new shuttlecraft - Jean-Luc
Picard) 
RIKER: Captain? 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Number One. 
RIKER: Are you on the Bridge? 
PICARD [OC]: Where else would I be? 
RIKER: Well. right now I think you should be in Shuttlebay two.
