PULASKI PICARD DATA SARJENKA

[Pulaski's office]

PICARD [OC]: And her visit to this ship? 
PULASKI: Assuming her brain structure is similar to ours, the memories
would be stored chemically on the neurons of the cerebral cortex.
They're also time dependent. I would have to scan for age of the
chemical links, and try to find 
[Ready room]

PULASKI [OC]: The relevant neurons. 
PICARD: Well, do your best.

[Corridor]

SARJENKA: You have many different kinds of people
here. 
DATA: Yes. 
SARJENKA: When I am bigger, can I be on your ship? 
DATA: I am certain that you could. 
SARJENKA: I wish I could come with you now. 
DATA: I am afraid that is not possible. 
SARJENKA: I know, but I can still wish for it.

[Pulaski's office]

DATA: Doctor Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. 
PULASKI: Hello, Sarjenka. 
SARJENKA: Hello. 
(She picks up a brown and white stone from the desk) 
SARJENKA: What is this? 
PULASKI: An Elanin singer stone. It sings a different song for each
person. 
SARJENKA: What does it sing for you? 
DATA: It does not sing for me. 
SARJENKA: Why not? 
DATA: Because I am a machine. 
PULASKI: Sarjenka, we're going to run a few scans just to be sure
you're all right. Data's will be right here. Don't worry.

[Sickbay]

(Sarjenka lies down on a bed, and Pulaski puts her
to sleep)
PULASKI: You did a good thing, Data. 
DATA: But are we doing a good thing now, Doctor? 
PULASKI: This is to protect her as much as us. 
DATA: By robbing her of her memories? 
PULASKI: To remember you and this ship would complicate her future. She
has to be the person she was born to be. And you'll remember.
