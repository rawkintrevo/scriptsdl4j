(Frere Jacques drifts through the evening air) 
BATAI: You've been brooding behind that flute all evening. 
PICARD: I'm not brooding. I'm immersed in my music. 
BATAI: Music. 
PICARD: I find that it helps me think, but the real surprise is I enjoy
it so much. 
BATAI: No, the real surprise is that you may actually be improving. 
ELINE: Batai? 
BATAI: Yes, ma'am. 
ELINE: Go home. 
BATAI: Yes, ma'am. Goodnight, Kamin. 
PICARD: Goodnight, my friend. 
ELINE: Go carefully, Batai. 
(Batai leaves) 
ELINE: Don't forget these. (picks up his shoes) I won't put them away
for you again. 
PICARD: Yes, ma'am. 
ELINE: I've done nothing but nag all day. I'm sorry. 
PICARD: No, I'm the one who's sorry. Everything you said this morning
was absolutely correct. I feel that I have given you so little and you
have given me so much. 
ELINE: No. You're a good man. A wonderful husband. I didn't mean 
PICARD: No, not such a wonderful husband. I spend my spare time
charting the stars. I disappear for days at a time exploring the
countryside. My life is very much as it was. Old habits. 
ELINE: You're gentle and kind. You never once raised your voice to me. 
PICARD: I'd like to ask your permission to build something. 
ELINE: Kamin, you've built your telescope, your laboratory. You don't
need my permission for something new. 
PICARD: In this case, I think I do. 
ELINE: What is it? 
PICARD: A nursery. 
ELINE: Really? Really? 
PICARD: Unless, of course, if you would prefer a porch. It would
certainly be easier to build. I could make a start on it right away. 
ELINE: No. 
(They embrace and kiss)

RIKER: Geordi, any progress identifying the probe? 
LAFORGE: Maybe. I've picked up some residue on the probe's shell. I
think it came from the propulsion system. Looks like it used a solid
propellant as fuel. 
RIKER: Solid propellant? 
LAFORGE: Sensors read this stuff as crystalline emiristol. It produces
a radioactive trail that ought to be traceable. 
RIKER: Then we should be able to send out a probe of our own, trace it
back to the origin. 
LAFORGE: I'll get right on it. 
DATA: Commander, I have been analysing the nucleonic beam. I believe it
would be possible to reflect the particles back toward the probe in a
way that would disrupt the signal. 
RIKER: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I simply don't know the risk of shutting down the beam. 
RIKER: I'm not willing to let this thing keep drilling into him. 
CRUSHER: If somebody gets stabbed, you don't necessarily pull the knife
out right away. It might do more harm than leaving it there. 
WORF: The Captain is under attack. We must act. 
RIKER: I'm inclined to agree. Doctor, monitor him closely. Mister Data,
prepare to disrupt the beam. We're going to try to cut this cord.
