TIMICIN LWAXANA LAFORGE PICARD

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: Jean-Luc! You delicious man. You were just
thinking of me, weren't you? 
PICARD: As a matter of fact 
LWAXANA: Well think no further, dear heart. She's here! 
PICARD: Yes, indeed. 
LWAXANA: Oh, serious. You're always so serious. 
PICARD: Lwaxana, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy at the moment. 
LWAXANA: And you're always busy with something or other. Never the
right thing, though. My daughter tells me that we're picking up someone
interesting here. 
PICARD: Yes, the leading scientist of Kaelon Two and 
LWAXANA: Oh, Kaelon Two? I've never heard of that. 
PICARD: Well, Lwaxana, it is something of a rather delicate
situation It's the first real contact with a rather reclusive
race, and this is in the nature of an official greeting, so 
LWAXANA: Diplomacy. I adore diplomacy. Everyone dresses so well. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD: Mister O'Brien, energise. 
(Charles Emerson Winchester III beams in, having escaped from the 4077
MASH) 
PICARD: Doctor Timicin. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of The Enterprise.
This is Lieutenant Commander La Forge. 
TIMICIN: I beg your pardon, Captain. This is my first time aboard a
Federation starship. Oh yes, they told me. Shaking hands, a form of
greeting. 
PICARD: I beg your pardon. Doctor Timicin, allow me to present Lwaxana
Troi of Betazed. She's also a guest on board, and 
LWAXANA: And Daughter of The Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred Chalice
of Rixx, Heir of the Holy Rings of Betazed, and what are you doing for
dinner? 
TIMICIN: Well, I don't know, really. 
PICARD: Lwaxana, we have quite a bit of work planned. 
LWAXANA: The man's never been on board a starship before, Jean-Luc.
Certainly somebody ought to make him comfortable before you get
started. 
PICARD: It seems that Mrs Troi is our acting ambassador of goodwill for
today. 
LWAXANA: You just think of me as your Entertainment Director. 
(Picard, Lwaxana and Timicin leave) 
LAFORGE: That man is in a lot of trouble.

Captain's Log. Stardate 44805.7. For generations,
the people of Kaelon Two have been working to revitalise their dying
sun. The Federation has offered to assist in testing what may be a
solution to this problem.
