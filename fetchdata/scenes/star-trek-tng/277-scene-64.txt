[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Auxiliary power. I'm having trouble
keeping the impulse engines online. I've got power fluctuations all
across the board. 
PICARD: Maintain course and speed. Mister Data, how long until we reach
the centre? 
DATA: At least thirty seconds, sir.

[Future - Bridge]

GAINES: We've entered the anomaly.

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: We have reached the centre, sir. 
PICARD: Initiate warp shell!

[Bridge]

DATA: Initiating static warp shell now.

[Future - Bridge]

RIKER: Is it having any effect?

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Something is happening. A new subspace
barrier appears to be forming, 
TASHA: Captain, the sensors are picking up two other ships. 
(and we see the other Enterprises on the three viewscreens)

[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Captain, it appears to be working. The
anomaly is beginning to collapse. I think that 
TASHA: Temporal energy is rupturing our warp containment system! 
WORF: We must eject the core! 
PICARD: No, we have to maintain the static warp shell as long as
possible! 
TASHA: We're losing containment, Captain! I can't stop it, it's going
to 
(KaBOOM!)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transfer emergency power to the antimatter
containment system! 
LAFORGE: I'm trying, but there's a lot of interference. 
DATA: The warp shell is definitely having an effect, sir. The anomaly
is collapsing. 
LAFORGE: I can't hold it. The containment system is going. 
PICARD: Maintain position! Mister La 
(KaBOOM!)

[Future - Bridge]

DATA: Both of the other ships have been destroyed. 
Q: Two down, one to go. 
PICARD: Data, report! 
DATA: The anomaly is nearly collapsed. 
LAFORGE: We're losing containment. 
Q: Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'm going to miss you. You had such potential.
But then again, all good things must come to an end. 
LAFORGE: Containment field is at critical. I'm losing it! 
(the anomaly sucks into the Enterprise and KaBOOM!)
