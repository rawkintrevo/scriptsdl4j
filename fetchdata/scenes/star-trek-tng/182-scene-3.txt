PICARD: Mister Data, we must hurry or we'll miss
Commander Riker's party. 
DATA: Sir. I find it interesting how much importance humans place on
celebrating the day of their birth. A day they cannot possibly
remember. 
CREWMAN: Captain, I am detecting some unusual fluctuations in subspace
frequencies. 
PICARD: You'd better take a look at it, Mister Data. 
DATA: It appears we are being probed, sir. 
PICARD: Source? 
DATA: The third planet of the Alpha Onias system. Our reports list it
as presently uninhabited. Perhaps reports were incorrect, sir. 
PICARD: Maybe the rumours of a secret Romulan base in this sector are
true. Picard to Commander Riker.

[Ten Forward]

PICARD [OC]: I apologise for interrupting your
celebration, but I'm going to need an away team. Could you report to
the Bridge, please?

[Bridge]

DATA: Although Alpha Onias three is a class M
planet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable. 
RIKER: Any life signs? 
DATA: No, sir, but we have traced residual energy readings to a cavern
two kilometres beneath the surface. 
WORF: Romulans? 
DATA: It is possible. 
PICARD: I suppose you'll just have to go down there and find out. 
RIKER: Geordi, Worf, you're with me. 
PICARD: Number One. Happy birthday.
