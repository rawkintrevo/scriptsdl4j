[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: We're having trouble reading you. 
PICARD: And we are having similar difficulties reading you. I am
advising you and your away team

[Cavern]

PICARD [OC]: to transport up at once. 
LAFORGE: That's good advice, Commander. We've got a sudden build up of
gases here, especially methane. 
RIKER: Transporter Room. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: Take us up. 
GUEST1: I can't get a solid lock on you, sir. Too much interference.

[Cavern]

GUEST1 [OC]: I'm trying again.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, what's happening?

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Report. 
GUEST1: I'm trying again, sir. 
[Cavern]

(The team are on their knees, coughing, as the
transporter beam comes and goes. Then they finally collapse)

[Sickbay]

OGAWA: Doctor Crusher, he's awake. 
RIKER: Beverly? 
CRUSHER: Will. You remember me. That's good. What else do you remember,
Captain? 
RIKER: Captain? 
(He catches sight of his reflection. There's a little grey in the
beard) 
(After the opening titles) 
CRUSHER: Water, three Celsius. How do you feel? 
RIKER: Confused. 
CRUSHER: That's understandable, considering what's happened. 
RIKER: What has happened? What happened to Sickbay? To you? To me? 
CRUSHER: Sit down, Captain. 
RIKER: Captain? I am Commander William T Riker. What is going on here? 
CRUSHER: Sit. Please. What is the last thing that you remember clearly?

RIKER: Alpha Onias three. The Enterprise had been probed. Geordi, Worf,
and I transported down to track the source. 
CRUSHER: But all you found there was toxic gas. They barely had time to
get the three of you out. Will, that happened sixteen years ago. 
RIKER: That's not possible. 
CRUSHER: With an Altarian virus, anything is possible. In fact, we've
been expecting this. 
RIKER: Could you be more specific? 
CRUSHER: That day on Onias three, you were infected with a strain of
Altarian encephalitis, a retrovirus that incorporates its DNA directly
into the cells of its host. It can lie dormant for many years and then
suddenly become active again, as it did in your case ten days ago. You
have been in a coma, delirious. Your fever finally broke this morning. 
(really? So why is he in uniform and not sickbay gown?) 
RIKER: But what happened to my memory? 
CRUSHER: Let me show you a scan of your brain tissue. When the
encephalitis became active it caused widespread synapse degradation,
interrupting the consolidation of your memory patterns. 
RIKER: Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Will, this virus inevitably causes memory loss back to the
moment of the original infection. In your case, all the way back to
Alpha Onias three. 
RIKER: I don't believe this. Is this a dream? 
CRUSHER: Feel my hand. It is flesh and bone. This is not a dream and
you are, in fact, Captain William T. Riker in command of the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: The Enterprise. For how long? 
CRUSHER: Nine years. 
RIKER: If I have lost my memory, how do I get it back? 
CRUSHER: Memories are formed by association. Smells, sounds, and images
from the present could possibly trigger them. 
RIKER: Like a song reminds you of an old friend. 
CRUSHER: Exactly. In associational therapy, we expose the patient to
familiar surroundings. This could stimulate the brain's neural synapses
into regenerating. 
RIKER: Then let's get started. There's nothing more familiar than the
Enterprise. Maybe that'll bring back some 
CRUSHER: Will, I said your memory could return. In many of these cases
the damage is permanent.
