easily transmitter lost rocks cell way advised situation research

[Holding cell]

(Riker enters the comfortably furnished cell.
Tomalak and the guard stay outside) 
RIKER: Jean-Luc? 
TOMALAK: That is not his name, of course, nor have you ever really met
him. We merely used his image to augment your
programme. 
RIKER: What have you done to him? 
TOMALAK: While I am gone, please give careful thought to your
situation. 
(the forcefield goes back up, and the Romulans leave) 
RIKER: What's your name? 
(the boy backs away from him) 
RIKER: Whoa. If we're going to get out of here, you're going to have to
trust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you get
here? My name is Will. 
ETHAN: Ethan. They brought me here with my parents. We were at a
research station on Miridian six. 
RIKER: Miridian six? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought that
was uninhabited. 
ETHAN: The station was set up last year. Then the Romulans came. 
RIKER: It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are your
parents now? 
ETHAN: They took them away. 
RIKER: Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here? 
ETHAN: No. I just want to get away. 
RIKER: I'll get us out of here, Ethan. 
ETHAN: How? Even if we do get away, they'll find us. They found me when
I escaped before. 
RIKER: You escaped? 
ETHAN: Yes. I hid in a secret place for weeks, but they caught me when
I came out to find food. 
(Tomalak and a guard storm back in) 
TOMALAK: I want that information, Commander. I want the location of
Outpost twenty three. Very well. I have been given permission to use
whatever means are necessary 
(Ethan makes a run for it through the open door) 
RIKER: Ethan, no! 
TOMALAK: Stop him! 
(Riker punches Tomalak, then gets the guard off Ethan and takes his
weapon) 
[Tunnel]

RIKER: That secret hiding place of yours? 
(he shoots another guard) 
ETHAN: This way 
(they run, shooting another Romulan on the way) 
ETHAN: In here.

[Crawlspace]

(Ethan fastens the grill back in place. Another
Romulans tests it and tries to look in, then leaves) 
RIKER: Their sensors should have picked us up. 
ETHAN: No, they can't. I heard them. There's something in these rocks. 
RIKER: Heavy metals? 
ETHAN: Right. 
(they go through a hole in a wall into -)

[Store room]

ETHAN: The Romulans forgot all about this storeroom
when they rebuilt their tunnels. Here, use these. Help me. 
(they build a barricade of boxes in front of the hole, then switch on
the light. It's quite a big room) 
ETHAN: After I got away last time, I mapped out all their tunnels.
Supply depot, communications, living quarters and shuttlebay. 
RIKER: How many guards in the shuttlebay? 
ETHAN: Only two or three. 
RIKER: If we stole a shuttlecraft, that would get us nowhere. The
Romulans could follow their own ship to easily. But if we broke into
their communications system, we could send a message to the Enterprise.

ETHAN: We can't do that. The transmitter is on a voice-activated
security system. 
RIKER: Do you know whose voice activates it? 
ETHAN: Only Ambassador Tomalak. 
RIKER: Who? 
ETHAN: Tomalak. 
RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? Tomalak is a Romulan Captain. The only time
he was ever called Ambassador was in a holodeck fantasy. How do you
know about that? 
ETHAN: You, er, you told me about him. 
RIKER: Who are you? What is your part in all this? 
(noises off) 
ETHAN: They've found us! 
RIKER: But you said their sensors didn't work in this tunnel. 
ETHAN: They must have fixed them. We've got to go! 
RIKER: Where are we going to go, Ethan? 
ETHAN: The shuttlebay. There's still time. 
RIKER: I've had enough. 
(the barricade is knocked down) 
TOMALAK: Commander, surrender your weapon. 
RIKER: No more games. No more fantasies. I'm not going to play anymore.

(and the Romulans and the store room vanish)

[Cavern]

RIKER: It was never the Romulans. It was you all
along, wasn't it?

[Bridge]

DATA: There is no question about it, sir. It is his
signal. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Do you read me? 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Picard. I'm here. 
PICARD: Are you all right? 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir, I'm all right. What about

[Cavern]

RIKER: Geordi and Worf? 
PICARD [OC]: We beamed them up an hour ago. They're fine.

[Bridge]

PICARD: But we lost you in mid-transport. Where've
you been? What is going on down there? 
RIKER [OC]: I'm not sure yet, sir.
