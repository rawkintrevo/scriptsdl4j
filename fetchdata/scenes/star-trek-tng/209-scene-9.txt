[Corridor]

DATA: If you're referring to the first production
model automobile of the twentieth century, perhaps the subsequent Model
A might be a more apt analogy, since I am Doctor Noonian Soong's
revised prototype. 
RASMUSSEN: I stand corrected.

[Rasmussen's quarters]

DATA: Is there a problem, Professor? 
RASMUSSEN: I suppose it will have to do, for now. I'll get you a list
of the things I'll be needing, okay? 
DATA: Would I be correct, Professor, in assuming that you know whether
or not I am still alive in the twenty sixth century? 
(Rasmussen washes his hands and then holds them out for a towel. Data
obliges) 
DATA: Since you seemed to know so much about Captain Picard and the
ship, I assumed that you would. 
RASMUSSEN: It'd be best if you kept your assumptions to yourself,
wouldn't it? 
DATA: Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

Captain's log, stardate 45350.3. We have arrived at
Penthara Four and can see for ourselves the atmospheric devastation
caused by the asteroid impact.

[Penthara science lab]

(a lot of snow has fallen) 
PICARD: We've located three underground pockets of carbon dioxide,
here, here and here. Our drilling phasers can release enough of the gas
to form an envelope which would temporarily hold in the heat of the
sun. 
MOSELEY: We've spend years, decades, trying to avoid anything that
would lead to a greenhouse effect and now here we are about to create
one on purpose. 
LAFORGE: Less than twenty percent of your normal sunlight is getting
through that dust, Doctor. If we can hold enough heat in with the CO2,
that should give the planet time to mend itself. 
WOMAN: Excuse me, Doctor Moseley. 
MOSELEY: What now? 
WOMAN: New Seattle's reporting a cloud depth of twelve kilometres. Two
rivers, tropical rivers, are beginning to freeze. 
MOSELEY: We'd better get started before there's nothing left to mend.
