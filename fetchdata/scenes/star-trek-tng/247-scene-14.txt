TROI DATA RIKER SYRUS

[Corridor]

RIKER: How's Lieutenant Suna? 
TROI: A little shaken but all right. 
RIKER: I feel like such an idiot. 
TROI: It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're your friends. We all
know the stress you've been under. I'm sure everyone understands
perfectly. 
DATA: Commander, I must compliment you on your performance this
evening. 
RIKER: Oh? 
DATA: Your unexpected choice to improvise was an effective method of
drawing the audience into the plight of your character. You gave a
truly realistic interpretation of multi-infarct dementia. 
RIKER: Thank you. 
TROI: Well, maybe not everyone understands. 
RIKER: I think I'd better get a little rest. Clear my mind a little. 
TROI: I want you to try a few relaxation techniques as well. Remember
the ones I showed you a few months ago?

RIKER: They never seem to work for me. 
SYRUS [OC]: Maybe you need another treatment. 
TROI: What's wrong? 
RIKER: Nothing. Nothing. 
TROI: Will, I want you to get some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow. 
RIKER: Okay.

RIKER: It's not real. It's not real. 
(he closes his eyes and when he opens them again)
