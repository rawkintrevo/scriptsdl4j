(the female alien is waking up, and flickering
between human and alien) 
PICARD: Can you communicate? 
ALIEN: Yes. 
PICARD: You're injured. 
ALIEN: Why have you interfered with us? 
PICARD: You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that. 
ALIEN: We need your energy. 
PICARD: Perhaps we can find a substitute. 
ALIEN: No. There is none. We must continue. 
PICARD: We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew have
returned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site on
Devidia Two. 
ALIEN: Destroy it? Your weapons will only amplify the time distortion.
You will annihilate your own world.

RIKER: I'm going back for Captain Picard. Mister
Worf, assemble an Away team to accompany me to the surface. Doctor, I
need to know anything you can tell me about that ophidian. 
CRUSHER: I've just started running some tests. If I can have a few
hours. 
RIKER: I can't give the alien any more time. 
CRUSHER: Will, I haven't been able to determine if our phaser energy
can generate a stable field. The risk would be 
RIKER: I'll take that risk. 
WORF: Sir. Permission to speak frankly. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
WORF: Our priority is to stop the aliens from any more incursions to
Earth. Any delay is unacceptable. 
RIKER: If I can save Captain Picard, I consider that very acceptable. 
WORF: The Captain would not. I recommend we target photon torpedoes on
the alien habitat and destroy it. Immediately. 
TROI: He's right, Will. 
RIKER: Power up the photons, Mister Worf. Alert me when they're ready.
