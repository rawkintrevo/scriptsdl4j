RIKER: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeck
three. 
WESLEY: Commander? I've studied all the technical manuals on the
holodecks, sir. I think I can be of some help down there. 
RIKER: Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Right
now, your duty's here on the Bridge.
TROI: Will. His mother's missing too. 
RIKER: Come on, Wesley. 
[Interrogation room]

BELL: And you say you never met her before she came
to hire you. 
PICARD: I've already told you that twice. 
BELL: Yeah? Well you're going to have to tell me again. 
PICARD: Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. 
MCNARY: Easy, Dan! 
BELL: You think you're tough, Hill, but you're nothing! 
(Bell leaves) 
MCNARY: Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving
him a hard time. You know how it is. 
PICARD: Actually, I do need to get out of here. 
MCNARY: I'll see what I can do.

[Police station]

(Crusher is continuing to try and imitate the other
women, this time by powdering her nose. The Desk Sergeant is enjoying
the view) 
CRUSHER: Something on your mind? 
SERGEANT: Yeah, nut I'm not sure it can be repeated in mixed company.
(he offers her gum) You're a pretty hep lookin' broad. 
CRUSHER: Is that good? 
SERGEANT: It ain't bad. You like Tommy Dorsey? (she nods) I got two
tickets for the dance tomorrow night. 
(Crusher swallows the gum)
