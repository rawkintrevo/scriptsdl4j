PICARD: Do it! 
JAKE [OC]: But I'll burn up! 
DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I am
giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva!

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Okay. It's done. 
PICARD [OC]: Good. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Now, monitor your speed exactly. When it
hits point zero two zero, I want you to restart the engine 
[Shuttlecraft]

PICARD [OC]: And when I tell you, pull up hard.
JAKE: Point zero two zero speed. Captain, I sure hope you're right. 
PICARD [OC]: You'll just have to trust me. 
JAKE: Point zero zero three. 
[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero zero nine. Zero one two. 
DATA: Six seconds to impact.

[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero one nine. 
PICARD: Restart the engine, now! Pull up hard! 
REMMICK: (amongst others) Yeah! 
RIKER: Incredible, Captain! 
REMMICK: How did he do it? I thought 
LAFORGE: He built up enough speed and then bounced her off the
atmosphere! 
PICARD: Mister Kurland, I assume you can manoeuvre it home? 
JAKE [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Do it. Then report to Mister Riker. 
JAKE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir! 
REMMICK: Very original, Captain. But how did that child acquire access
to a shuttlecraft? 
RIKER: Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate,
fully trained in many areas including shuttles. 
REMMICK: And did this full training include discipline? 
PICARD: Mister Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Which is
why Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically in
discipline 
REMMICK: I'll note that in my report. 
PICARD: Full cooperation, Number One.

[Relva 7 Corridor]

RONDON: You. I have a package for Operations. Where
is it? 
WESLEY: End of the corridor, room on your right. One oh four. 
(The seven foot tall man bumps Wesley as he walks between him and
Mordock) 
WESLEY: Excuse me. 
RONDON: You blocked my path. you Bulgallian sludge rat! 
WESLEY: I'm sorry, it was an honest mistake. I apologise. 
CHANG: Is there a problem here, gentlemen? 
WESLEY: No, sir, I 
RONDON: How dare you! I am Rondon, you despicable Melanoid slimeworm!
Liar! 
WESLEY: Who do you think you're bullying? You bumped into me. It was
your mistake. You were at fault. Do you want this to become violent? 
RONDON: Friend. I like you. 
(Rondon leaves, smiling) 
MORDOCK: A very strange reaction. 
WESLEY: Not really. When he raised his hand, I saw that it was webbed.
The sign of a Zaldan. 
CHANG: But you became hostile. 
WESLEY: Zaldans are infuriated by courtesy. They view it as a form of
phony social behaviour, designed to cover true feelings. 
CHANG: Congratulations, Mister Crusher. You handled that particular
incident very well. 
MORDOCK: Was this incident deliberate? 
CHANG: It's important to know how you candidates deal with other
cultures, other species. 
MORDOCK: Then it was a test. 
CHANG: Yes. Not all tests are announced, or what they appear to be. 
(Chang leaves) 
MORDOCK: Zaldans have webbed fingers? I wouldn't have passed.
