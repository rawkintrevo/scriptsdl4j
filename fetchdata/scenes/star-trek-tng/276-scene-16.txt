RIKER: We picked up a request for emergency
assistance from a Federation science ship in the Topin system. 
PICARD: Are there any other ships in the vicinity? 
RIKER: We're the closest. 
PICARD: Helm, set course for the Topin system. Mister Data, will you
signal the science ship that we're on our way. 
DATA: It is unlikely that they would receive our communication, sir.
The Topin system contains an unstable protostar. It generates
significant magnetoscopic interference. 
PICARD: Can we use our sensors to find them? 
DATA: Most of our sensors would be ineffective, although our
directional array should cut through the interference. 
RIKER: That array has such a narrow scan field. We might as well break
out the palm beacons and try to find them that way.

KALITA: This is insane. We're sitting here, no
sensors, blind to the outside, waiting for a galaxy class Starship to
come swooping down on us. 
RO: Don't worry. It'll be hard for them to locate us with just the
directional sensors. Besides, they're looking for a damaged science
ship that wants to be found. They're here. Standby to engage thrusters.

RIKER: Anything? 
DATA: No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan this
system. 
WORF: Captain, the distress call is being repeated. 
PICARD: Data, can you locate the signal? 
DATA: I am attempting to do so.

[Ro's ship]

KALITA: They're scanning our last position. 
RO: All right, I've locked onto their sensor beam. I'm going to use it
to manoeuvre into transporter range. 
KALITA: How are we going to beam through their shields? 
RO: We can't. If we're going to get those medical supplies, we're going
to have to take this ship through their shields.
