Q VASH NURSE SIRGUY

[Castle courtyard]

Q: Congratulations, Sir Guy. I see you've snared
the jackal. 
SIR GUY: It's Marian who deserves the credit. Took him with his own
sword.

[Marian's chamber] 
NURSE: You sent for me, Milady? 
VASH: I want you to take this letter to Robin's men. 
NURSE: You want me to go to Sherwood Forest at this time of night? 
VASH: You'll leave immediately. 
NURSE: But it's dark. I'll get lost. Besides, it's not safe. What with
all them hedge robbers and worse lurking about. 
VASH: Please, this is urgent. 
NURSE: If you ask me, you'd be better off with Sir Guy. He's got a
future. Why, you'll be living in London afore you know it. 
VASH: But you must go, otherwise they'll kill him. 
(the Sheriff enters) 
Q: Out. 
(the nurse leaves) 
VASH: How dare you barge in here like this 
Q: I've come to apologise for my harsh words. I had no idea that you
were so ruthless. 
VASH: That's most gracious of you. 
Q: I admit I was surprised, but no more surprised than Jean-Luc. 
VASH: You're Q. 
Q: Yes. And you are a very interesting woman. What is this? 
VASH: Give me that. 
Q: A letter to Riker. Quick, Come to Castle. Save the Captain. Why,
this is wonderful. What marvellous duplicity. You
certainly fooled Sir Guy, and me as well. I think you're worth further
study. 
VASH: Am I? 
Q: Yes, but unfortunately we just don't have the time. Guards! Take
this traitor away. It appears there's going to be a double execution.
