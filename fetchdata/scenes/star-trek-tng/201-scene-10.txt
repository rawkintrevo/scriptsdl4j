PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE HOBSON

[Sutherland Bridge]

HOBSON: We've arrived at the designated
coordinates, Captain. 
DATA: All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. 
HOBSON: Starboard power coupling has overloaded. We've got a radiation
leak on decks ten through twelve. 
DATA: Why are the backups not functioning? 
HOBSON: There wasn't enough time to test all the backups before we left
the yard. Terry, I want you down in Engineering working on a new
coupling. 
DATA: You have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline. 
HOBSON: Keith, you and I will start bringing the radiation 
DATA: Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a course
of action without consulting the commanding officer. 
HOBSON: I was trying to safeguard the lives of people on those decks,
but you're right. Belay those orders, everyone.
Phasers and torpedoes are back online. What should we do, sir? 
DATA: You will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and begin
repairs of the starboard power coupling. 
HOBSON: Thank you, sir. You heard the Captain, everyone.

RIKER [on monitor]: We're ready, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take the
Romulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated? 
LAFORGE [on monitor]: Not long Romulan sensors are as good as ours. 
PICARD: Very well. Energise the network.
