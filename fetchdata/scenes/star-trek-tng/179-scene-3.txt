WESLEY CRUSHER LAFORGE COMPUTER RIKER [OC]
says positive doorbell antimatter interrupt computer time beverly disconnect

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Wes, time for the experiment is over. I
want my warp engines back now. 
WESLEY: Almost done, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Almost isn't good enough. You want to be the one to explain
when the Captain says 'Engage' and we just sit here? 
WESLEY: I just need a couple more minutes. I'm ready to try the new
warp field. Mom? 
CRUSHER: Don't let me interrupt. 
LAFORGE: Wesley! 
WESLEY: Right! Okay! 
(There's a sudden flash. Wesley looks concerned.) 
LAFORGE: Computer, level two diagnostic on warp drive systems. 
COMPUTER: Antimatter containment positive. Warp drive within normal
parameters. 
LAFORGE: Wesley, talk to me. 
WESLEY: That shouldn't have happened. Why would there be any visible
phenomena outside the drive? 
RIKER [OC]: Prepare for umbilical disconnect. 
LAFORGE: Are you done? 
WESLEY: Yeah. Mom? 
(But she's not there) 
RIKER [OC]: Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters. 
LAFORGE: Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power to the helm.

override code)
