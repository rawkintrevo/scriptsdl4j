[Engineering]

(Shimoda is using the chips as building blocks,
Wesley is muttering and Riker and MacDougal are trying to get past the
force field) 
WESLEY: Lock on. Lock on Tsiolkovsky. 
RIKER: Where's that sonic driver? 
MACDOUGAL: It's over there. Okay, let's see if this cuts out his
tractor beam power. (No, it doesn't) Oh, come on. 
[Crusher's Office]

(The symptoms are starting to set in) 
CRUSHER: Oh no! I must find the answer. I've got to find the answer. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, tractor beam. We just locked onto
the Tsiolkovsky. 
PICARD: Captain to. Wesley. Wesley Crusher, come in! 
(Data enters, smiling and weaving slightly) 
PICARD: Ah, Data. At least you're functioning. 
DATA: Fully, Captain. 
PICARD: Data, intoxication is a human condition. Your mind is
different, it's not the same as 
DATA: We are more alike than unlike, my dear Captain. I have pores.
Humans have pores. I have fingerprints. Humans have fingerprints. My
chemical nutrients are like your blood. If you prick me, do I not leak?

(Crusher enters) 
PICARD: Doctor, 
CRUSHER: Captain, can I see you in your Ready Room? It's a private
matter. No, actually it's an urgent one. 
PICARD: But. Damn it. 
(Data makes as if to lean on a chair, but there is nothing there and he
falls) 

[Ready Room]

PICARD: Now, Doctor 
CRUSHER: I believe I'm infected myself, Captain. 
PICARD: Do you know what the infection is? Come on, quickly. 
CRUSHER: Sorry. It is definitely like alcohol intoxication. The same
lack of good judgment, For example, right now I find you extremely,
extremely, Of course we haven't time for that sort of thing, 
PICARD: What sort of thing? 
CRUSHER: Oh God, would I love to show you. 
PICARD: Doctor, there must be a cure. Some formula, similar to the old
one, 
CRUSHER: Damn it, damn it, Captain. My dear Captain. 
(She tries to kiss him, but he dodges) 
CRUSHER: You owe me something. You do realise that, don't you? I'm a
woman. I haven't the comfort of a husband. A man. 
PICARD: Not now, Doctor. Please.

(Beverly goes to the turbolift, and Picard waves
her goodbye) 
WORF: Bridge to Riker, Urgent.

[Engineering ]

RIKER: Riker here. 
WORF [OC]: Sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, regret to inform you that the Captain
appears to be infected. And Data.
