[Engineering]

WESLEY: He is on the Bridge, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare for saucer separation. 
WESLEY: Sir, we're at Warp nine three. 
PICARD: I am aware of the risks, Ensign. When the umbilical splits, we
should regain primary control, do you agree? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: The saucer module should fall out of warp in two minutes. Be
prepared to sweep back. Pull it in with a tractor beam. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Initiate auto sequence.

from your present location. 
PICARD: And just what location are they accepted from?

functions. 
PICARD: It seems Commander Data has it them as well.
