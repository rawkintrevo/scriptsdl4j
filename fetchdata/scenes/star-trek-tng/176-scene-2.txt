RIKER WORF PICARD TROI CHIEF NURSE CRUSHER JONO

[Talarian ship]

WORF: Ancillary power is failing. 
CRUSHER: They're nothing more than children. 
RIKER: I am Commander Riker of the Federation Starship Enterprise. We
will evacuate you and give you medical care. You will not be harmed. 
CRUSHER: Enterprise, prepping five Talarian males for transport
directly to Sickbay. Trauma team, stand by to receive injured. We have
radiation burns and possible respiratory distress. 
CHIEF [OC]: Transport locked in and ready, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Stand by for my orders. 
RIKER: Captain, this appears to be a basic training ship. Five boys,
all teens, all wearing uniforms. 
PICARD [OC]: Proceed with the evacuation, Number One. 
WORF: No other life signs aboard, sir. 
CRUSHER: Commander, quickly. 
RIKER: What is it? 
CRUSHER: This boy. He's human.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have completed
emergency evacuation of four Talarians and one human. How this young
man found himself in the company of these aliens remains a mystery.

[Sickbay]

(The boy is sitting up, staring straight ahead, not
responding) 
CRUSHER: It's Jono, right? Is that what I heard them call you? I'm
Doctor Crusher. I'm just examining you for radiation injuries. It won't
hurt. I have a son not much older than you. Perhaps you'd like to meet
him. Well, Jono, you seem to have escaped radiation damage. Pretty
lucky. 
NURSE: Doctor Crusher. 
(Hands over a PADD with his examination results) 
CRUSHER: Now how did this happen? 
(All the boys suddenly start making a keening noise and rocking back
and forth) 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
TROI: They're terrified. 
(Picard and Riker enter) 
CRUSHER: They all just started up. 
PICARD: Please may I have your attention. Please may I have your
attention! Stop that immediately! (silence) Well, that's better. Now,
what's your name, young man? 
TROI: He won't talk, Captain. We haven't been able to get through to
him. 
JONO: Captain (stands up and bows) I am Jono. Take me home to
my Captain. Take me home to Endar!
