PICARD VASH CRUSHER RIKER CREWMAN

[Picard's quarters]

(guess what happened between the kiss and
breakfast) 
PICARD: I had no idea you were a member of the Archaeology Council. You
are a member, aren't you? 
VASH: More or less. 
PICARD: Why did you come to Tagus Three? 
VASH: To see you, of course. 
PICARD: Is that the only reason? 
VASH: Isn't it enough? 
PICARD: I wish I could believe you. 
VASH: I really have missed you, Jean-Luc. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Excuse me. 
(he goes to the door) 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry I'm late. Oh. Excuse me. I didn't realise you had
company. 
PICARD: That's all right. Er, allow me to introduce you. This is
Beverly, Doctor Beverly, Doctor Beverly Crusher. This is Vash. She's a
friend of mine from the Archaeology Council. 
CRUSHER: I didn't mean to interrupt. The Captain and I often share
morning tea together. 
VASH: Yes, I know. Jean-Luc has told me all about you. 
CRUSHER: Really? When was that? 
VASH: On Risa, where we met. 
CRUSHER: I see. That must have been during your vacation last year. 
PICARD: No. Yes. Yes. 
CRUSHER: Well, I'm surprised he never mentioned you. 
VASH: So am I. Doctor, are you busy? 
CRUSHER: Not at the moment. 
VASH: I was wondering, I would love to see some more of this marvellous
ship. 
CRUSHER: I would be delighted to show it to you. 
PICARD: I, er 
CRUSHER: That is, if it's all right with you, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: Of course. 
VASH: Don't worry, I promise to behave myself.

[Ten Forward]

CRUSHER: And this is Ten Forward, where the
Council's welcoming reception will be held today. 
VASH: Well, I can't think of a better location. Tell me, does Jean-Luc
come here often? 
CRUSHER: Not often. The Captain is a very private man. Would you like
something to drink? 
VASH: Please. 
RIKER: Eternity never looked so lovely. 
VASH: Excuse me? 
RIKER: I was referring to the view. Eternity never looked so lovely. 
VASH: You must be Commander Riker. 
RIKER: I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage. 
VASH: I didn't mean to interrupt. I believe you were about to tell me
that my eyes are as mysterious as the stars. 
RIKER: You're Betazoid. 
VASH: Not at all. It's just that Jean-Luc does a very good imitation of
you. 
RIKER: He does? 
CRUSHER: I see you two have met. 
RIKER: Not exactly. 
CRUSHER: This is Vash, a member of the Archaeology Council. And a
friend of the Captain's. 
RIKER: So I've gathered. 
CRUSHER: They met during his visit to Risa. 
RIKER: On Risa? That vacation must have been better than he let on. 
VASH: You mean he never mentioned me to you, either? 
CREWMAN [OC]: Doctor Crusher, please report to Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: I'm afraid I won't be able to finish our tour. But perhaps
Commander Riker could take over for me. 
RIKER: It would be my pleasure.
