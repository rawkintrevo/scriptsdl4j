CRUSHER: You're the only person on board to undergo
a memory probe by the Ullians. I'd like to do a neurological work up
and see if I can detect any residual effect. Doctor Martin will monitor
your vital signs while I conduct the scan. 
KEIKO: I'm happy to help. 
CRUSHER: Have you had any unusual symptoms since the probe? Headaches?
Dizziness? 
KEIKO: No, nothing like that. It was a wonderful experience. 
CRUSHER: Electrical activity is normal. CPK levels are normal.
Hippocampus is stable, and the thalamus? The thalamus is normal. There
is no indication at all of the electropathic residual. 
KEIKO: Is that good? 
CRUSHER: Oh, you're fine, Keiko. But I am no closer to solving this
mystery.

LAFORGE: Computer, locate the electropathic pattern
described in medical database four delta one. 
COMPUTER: Electropathic pattern located. 
LAFORGE: Okay, we're going to track down any possible cause of that
brain pattern. First, what are the medical conditions that might
account for it? 
COMPUTER: Iresine syndrome is a cause of the electropathic pattern. 
LAFORGE: Right. And Doctor Crusher already eliminated that, so how many
non-medical forces or substances might cause the pattern? 
COMPUTER: There are twenty two non-medical agents. 
LAFORGE: Okay. And how many of those are present on the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: None are present on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Are the ship's sensors calibrated to detect all those agents? 
COMPUTER: All agents are scanned by the sensors. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Let's start with the chemical substances. Name them. 
COMPUTER: Ferrazene, hylanatine, dardilion, chrysimite, and manzene. 
LAFORGE: Ferrazene has a complex molecular structure. It breaks down
into bilenium and tarrisite. Do the sensors scan for those? 
COMPUTER: Ship's sensors scan for both compounds. 
LAFORGE: And are they present on the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: Bilenium and tarrisite are not present. 
LAFORGE: Do any of the substances break down into by-products that are
not scanned for? 
COMPUTER: Dardilion contains the byproduct nilizene. Sensors do not
routinely scan for that substance. 
LAFORGE: Well, this isn't a routine situation. Scan for the nilizene. 
COMPUTER: There is no nilizene on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: How did I know you were going to say that? Okay. Let's move on
to the non-chemical agents.
