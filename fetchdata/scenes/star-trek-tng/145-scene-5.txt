[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: Thank you. 
RIKER: Glad to help. 
(Riker leaves, Homn picks up the case as if it were empty) 
PICARD: Well, I trust you will be comfortable here. If you will excuse
me. 
LWAXANA: I am be serving a Betazoid dinner of greeting tonight,
Captain. It is an ambassadorial function. 
PICARD: It sounds delightful. 
(Picard leaves) 
LWAXANA: He's a fine man. Solid, reliable. He's a little on the stuffy
side, but, all in all, he's not that bad. 
TROI: I can't believe you, Mother. You sound like you're sizing up a
commodity. 
LWAXANA: But that's exactly what men are, darling. Especially human
men. Was your father ever unhappy with me? 
TROI: No. He worshipped you. But I don't think I'll ever learn to see
men the way you do. 
LWAXANA: You will as you mature, darling. And the men in your life are
going to bless you for it. You're so beautiful.

WESLEY: And she actually complimented Captain
Picard on his legs? 
DATA: I would have thought a telepath would be more discreet, sir. 
RIKER: Exactly the opposite. She knows what's in your mind and she lets
you know what's on hers. 
PICARD: Gentlemen. I think we must not lose sight of the fact that
we're talking about someone who has been granted ambassadorial rank.
Even though she may appear somewhat eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be
treated with the appropriate respect. Is that understood? Picard to
Pulaski. 
PULASKI [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: When did you last time you look in on the Antedean guests?
