[Bridge]

WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased. 
RIKER: Increase shields to seventy five percent. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(a big wave sets off alarms) 
RIKER: Damage, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Minimal, sir. Shields are holding. 
(Picard, Timothy and Troi enter) 
PICARD: Ensign, full about. Go to warp two. 
FELTON: The gravitational distortion is too high. We can't maintain a
warp field. 
PICARD: Full shields. 
WORF: Aye. 
FELTON: Captain, impulse power has been disrupted. The helm won't
respond. 
TIMOTHY: We couldn't get out either. 
TROI: Timothy, perhaps you and I should go below and get out of
everyone's way. 
TIMOTHY: No. 
RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Stand by. 
TIMOTHY: That's what they kept saying. More shields, more shields. 
DATA: Timothy, accompany me, please. (go to science station) I want you
to recall everything you heard people say aboard the Vico before it was
destroyed. 
TIMOTHY: I don't know. Just that. Just more shields. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, I've transferred 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Fusion reactors four through nine into the
shield array. That should double the shield strength.

[Bridge]

WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased by an order
of magnitude. Impact in three, two, one. 
(very big hit) 
WORF: Wave front intensity is continuing to increase. Structural
over-pressure now exceeding one hundred eighty percent. 
PICARD: La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I don't understand. That should have been enough.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We could run the shield grid directly off
the warp drive.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. 
WORF: Initiating warp-transfer pathways now. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Diverting warp power to the shields. 
TIMOTHY: Warp power to the shields. They said that too, Data. I'm
positive. 
WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased by a factor of ten. Contact in
thirty one seconds. Without additional power to the shields, the outer
hull will not hold. 
RIKER: La Forge? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Warp transfer to the shields complete. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: That's as strong as they're going to
get. 
WORF: Impact in fifteen seconds. 
(Data finishes running his analysis) 
DATA: Sir, drop the shields. 
RIKER: That's suicide, Data. 
DATA: Captain, drop the shields. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
WORF: Aye. 
(a very gently ripple rocks the ship) 
DATA: Our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts, sir. We
have been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect. 
RIKER: The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse the
impact. 
DATA: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothy
remembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis of
shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation. 
PICARD: If we had transferred all that warp power to the shields, it
would have torn the ship apart. 
RIKER: Status, Ensign? 
FELTON: Navigation is coming back online. 
PICARD: Full about, one quarter impulse. Take us out of here.

[Classroom observation area]

(the class is singing 'Row your boat') 
TROI: Timothy's a boy feeling a great deal of pain. But he is a boy
again. Is this difficult for you, Data? 
DATA: Difficult? 
TROI: To watch him moving away from being like you. 
DATA: That would require an emotional context which I cannot provide.
