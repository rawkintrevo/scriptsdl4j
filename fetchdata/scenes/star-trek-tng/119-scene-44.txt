[Corridor]

(There's a series of bangs, and the sound of a
voice calling out) 
COMPUTER: Evacuate immediately. Sixty five seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Somebody help! There's something's wrong in the Environmental
lab! 
MAN [OC]: Help! 
(Wesley opens the door)

[Environmental Maintenance Laboratory]

(There's steam from ruptured pipes) 
MAN: Help! We're trapped. I can't move. Please, help me. 
(Wesley sees him pinned under a piece of pipe) 
MAN: We're going to die in here! 
(There's a second man cowering in the corner) 
MAN: The liquid hydrogen's going to blow! The shut off valve ruptured.
Hurry up! My legs are crushed. You've got to help me! 
(Wesley goes to lift the debris, and calls to the uninjured man in the
corner) 
WESLEY: Give me a hand with this! 
MAN 2: We're going to die! 
WESLEY: Help me! 
MAN 2: I can't! It's too late! 
COMPUTER: Thirty seconds to seal off. 
(Wesley gets the pipe off the injured man) 
WESLEY: Come on! 
MAN: If we don't get out of here fast, they'll seal us in to contain
the explosion. 
WESLEY: (dragging the casualty) Come on, you're not hurt. 
MAN 2: I can't go through that! 
WESLEY: Yes, you can. You've got to. 
COMPUTER: Twenty seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Come on! I can't carry you both! You're not hurt. 
COMPUTER: Ten seconds to seal off. 
WESLEY: Come on! 
MAN 2: It's too late. 
(The doors are closing as Wesley drags the casualty out) 
WESLEY: I'm sorry.

[Relva 7 Corridor]

WESLEY: Officer Chang! There's 
CHANG: Wesley! It's all right. 
(The casualty gets to his feet, dusts himself off and shakes Wesley's
hand) 
MAN: Thanks. 
CHANG: An excellent performance, Mister Crusher. 
(The other man walks out of the lab and leaves) 
WESLEY: Performance? That was the test? 
CHANG: Yes. 
WESLEY: A man could have died. 
CHANG: Theoretically, yes. You had to make a choice. And you did.
There's no right or wrong about it. Your greatest fear has been that
you couldn't make that decision. 
WESLEY: Because of my father? Because Cap. Because someone made that
choice, and my father died.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: Yes, Number One? 
RIKER: Mister Remmick has left the ship. 
PICARD: Yes. He found nothing wrong on the Enterprise. And you can
inform the crew that Admiral Quinn is most impressed. 
RIKER: Thank you. They'll be pleased that. Can you explain now what he
was after? 
PICARD: They were after me, Number One. They want me to take over as
Commandant, Starfleet Academy. 
RIKER: Congratulations! What a wonderful choice, sir. You'll be able to
shape the minds of the future leaders of Starfleet. You haven't decided
what you're going to do. 
PICARD: Yes, I have, Number One. I've decided I'm going for a walk.

[Classroom]

CHANG: I'm proud of all of you. You've done a
superb job. Each of you would make a fine Starfleet officer. It's
unfair that only one candidate from Relva will attend the Academy this
year, and a loss to the Federation if the rest of you do not return to
test again. Mister Mordock will be the candidate. His results were
slightly higher than Mister Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister Mordock.
You're the first Benzite in Starfleet. 
MORDOCK: Thank you, sir, but it's not right. It shouldn't be me. Wesley
lost points because he helped me. He should not be punished for his
generosity. 
CHANG: He wasn't. He lost time, but it wasn't only that. Candidates,
thank you. And good luck. 
(Chang leaves) 
MORDOCK: I am sorry, Wesley. 
WESLEY: It's okay. You deserved to win. Besides, you would have done
the same thing for me. 
MORDOCK: Yes. I believe I would. 
T'SHANIK: Congratulations. 
OLIANA: Well, personally, I hate losing. So you'd better be ready next
year, Wesley. I won't be easy to beat.

[Corridor]

(Picard is in dress uniform when he meets an
embarrassed Jake) 
PICARD: Mister Kurland! 
JAKE: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Are you feeling better? 
JAKE: Yes, sir, Look, I'm sorry I damaged the shuttle, Captain. But
Mister Riker says I can work on fixing it as part of my discipline
training. 
PICARD: Good idea. I hope you learned that running away solves nothing.

JAKE: Yes, sir. And I am sorry I messed up. 
PICARD: At least you kept your wits about you out there. Don't forget
that. 
JAKE: No, sir. And thank you. Thank you for saving my life. 
PICARD: That's my job, young man. 
JAKE: Yes, sir. 
[Observation Lounge]

PICARD: Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in your
dress uniform for Admiral Quinn's farewell dinner? 
WESLEY: I didn't think that would be appropriate. 
PICARD: Why not? 
WESLEY: I failed, Captain. I didn't get into the Academy. I failed you
and I failed the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Ridiculous. Did you do your best? 
WESLEY: Yes. 
PICARD: When you test next year, and you will test next year, do you
think your performance will improve? 
WESLEY: Yes. 
PICARD: Good. The only person you're truly competing against, Wesley,
is yourself. 
WESLEY: Then you're not disappointed? 
PICARD: Wesley, you have to measure your successes and your failures
within, not by anything I or anyone else might think. But, if it helps
you to know this, I failed the first time. And you may not tell anyone!

WESLEY: You? You failed? 
PICARD: Yes. But not the second time. Now, you'll do me the courtesy of
joining us at dinner. I have to disappoint an old friend.

[Transporter room]

QUINN: Wish I could convince you to change your
mind. 
PICARD: I'll serve you better here. 
QUINN: This is where you belong. 
PICARD: If you need me. 
QUINN: I've been playing politics too long. Perhaps I see conspiracies
everywhere. Don't worry. Safe travels, my friend.
