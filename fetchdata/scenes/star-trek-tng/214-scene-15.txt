(a phaser shot lances out into space) 
MACDUFF: (at tactical) The phasers are operational. 
WORF: We now have full tactical control. 
PICARD: (helm) We should run a complete diagnostic of all command
systems. 
WORF: A full diagnostic would require us to take our systems offline.
We would be defenceless. 
PICARD: If we're going to trust our lives to these systems, we should
be certain they're not going to fail. 
MACDUFF: The computer was damaged. Some processors might still be down.

WORF: Proceed with the diagnostic. 
(Crusher enters) 
WORF: What have you found, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Not much. The brain scans I've run are unusual, but there's no
damage to the hippocampus. That suggests that we still have our
long-term memories but somehow they're being blocked. 
PICARD: Is it possible to bypass the normal pathways? To get at those
memories some other way? 
CRUSHER: That's what I'm hoping. What I need now is to see some normal
brain scans for comparison. Is there any chance I can get the crew's
medical files? 
WORF: We are currently running a full diagnostic. Computer resources
are limited. 
PICARD: The medical records are our next priority. 
CRUSHER: Thank you.

(a crewman is standing in a doorway) 
CREWMAN: I guess these are my quarters, but I don't remember anything. 
RIKER: If it's any comfort, we're all in the same situation, so stay
put for now. We'll be back in touch. 
CREWMAN: Okay, sir. Thanks. 
RO: That's all I need for now. 
(the crewwoman she has been talking goes back into her quarters) 
RO: Well, that's it for the living quarters on this deck. What's next? 
RIKER: There's a large room up ahead called Ten Forward. 
RO: Let's go. So if everything were back to the way it was supposed to
be, what do you think you'd be doing right now? 
RIKER: I'd be having more fun than searching the ship, I'd imagine. 
RO: Fun? 
RIKER: Well, with that holodeck we just saw. I think I could conjure up
an interesting
programme or two. 
RO: Now that's disappointing. 
RIKER: Why? 
RO: You don't strike me as a man who needs a holodeck to have a good
time.

RIKER: Who reported to the Bridge from this group? 
TROI: I did. 
RIKER: Have you found anything that might give us some insight into
what happened? 
TROI: Not specifically, but there are two things that seem unusual. The
bartender is an artificial lifeform. 
DATA: Can I get you something? A beverage? 
RIKER: No, thank you. 
RO: I'm fine. 
RIKER: Your memories are gone as well? 
DATA: The databanks that identify who I am are not functioning. 
RIKER: You were going to mention something else? 
TROI: I don't know if this means anything, but I seem to have an
ability that the others don't. I have a very strong sense of what other
people are feeling at times it's almost 
RIKER: Is something wrong? 
TROI: No. Just for a moment, you seemed familiar. 
RIKER: You remember me? 
TROI: Not exactly. I mean, I don't know who you are, but there's
something about you. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to survey team. 
RIKER: Survey team here. Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: We have accessed the personnel files. Report to the Bridge
immediately. 
RO: We're on our way.

LAFORGE: Computer give me a biographical listing of
all personnel responsible for primary operation of the ship. 
COMPUTER: A full biographical listing is not available. 
LAFORGE: Is there any list of the ship's senior officers? 
COMPUTER: The crew manifest is available. 
LAFORGE: That's better than nothing. Give me the crew manifest. 
COMPUTER: Commanding Officer, Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Executive
Officer, Commander Keiran MacDuff. Second Officer, Commander
William Riker. Operations Officer, Lieutenant Commander Data. Chief
Medical Officer, Doctor Beverly Crusher. Ship's Counsellor, Lieutenant
Commander Deanna Troi. Chief Engineer, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La
Forge. Security Chief, Lieutenant Worf. Helm Officer, Ensign Ro Laren. 
PICARD: Commander MacDuff, have the other officers listed here report
to the Bridge. 
MACDUFF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Your next priority will be to retrieve any information you can
about this ship's mission. Contact the Operations
Officer to assist you. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RO: He's in Ten Forward, waiting tables. 
WORF: Captain. I regret my recent behaviour. I assumed an attitude of
authority that was unwarranted. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, we're all doing the best we can in a difficult
situation. Think nothing more of it. 
WORF: Thank you, Captain.
