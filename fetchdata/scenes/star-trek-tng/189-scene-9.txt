PICARD MIRASTA MALE DATA DURKEN

[Durken's office]

(The Chancellor is stamping documents) 
MALE [OC]: Chancellor, Minister Yale of the Space Bureau would like to
introduce you to someone. 
DURKEN: Call her back. See if the Vice-Chancellor will do. 
MALE [OC]: They're out here waiting to see you, sir. 
DURKEN: All right. Send them in. 
(Mirasta enters, follows by Picard, but Durken hasn't noticed) 
DURKEN: Always time to meet your friends, Mirasta. 
MIRASTA: Chancellor, I think you might want to clear your afternoon
schedule for this. 
(Picard walks forward, Durken's jaw drops) 
[Bridge]

PICARD: And this is the Bridge. 
MIRASTA: Chancellor. 
(a brief gaze at their planet on the viewscreen) 
PICARD: Here we have Environmental and Engineering stations, mission
operations, and the two principal science stations. 
PICARD: Data, allow me to introduce Chancellor Avel Durken and Space
Administrator Mirasta Yale. 
DATA: Chancellor. Minister. 
PICARD: Commander Data is my Second Officer. 
MIRASTA: He's an android, Chancellor. A constructed being. 
DURKEN: A machine? 
DATA: In a manner of speaking. The term artificial lifeform would be
more accurate. 
DURKEN: Captain Picard, is there someplace we might speak together
without distraction? 
PICARD: Certainly. 
MIRASTA: Chancellor, with your permission, I would like to beam to the
surface. I have several matters to attend to. 
DURKEN: Not a word to anyone about this, Mirasta. 
MIRASTA: Of course. 
PICARD: Mister Data, will you escort the Minister to the transporter
room? Chancellor. 
(Picard and Durken leave) 
MIRASTA: Has there still been no communication from Commander Riker,
Data? 
DATA: No, Minister. He has not returned to our designated transport
coordinates. We have continued to scan the capital city without
success.
