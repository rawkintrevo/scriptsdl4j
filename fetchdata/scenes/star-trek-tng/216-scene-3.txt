Think Hillary Clinton) 
CRUSHER: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly
Crusher. 
RUSSELL: A pleasure. I have some equipment aboard the Potemkin. Would
you please have it sent to one of your medical labs. 
CRUSHER: Of course. Send it to medlab four. 
CREWMAN: Yes, Doctor. 
RUSSELL: Before we get down to business, I just wanted to say that I
had the pleasure of reading your paper on cybernetic regeneration
recently. 
CRUSHER: Really? You're the first person to mention it. 
RUSSELL: I thought it was brilliant. 
[Corridor]

RUSSELL: Your ideas on bio-active interfaces border
on revolutionary. It's going to be a genuine pleasure working with you.

CRUSHER: Thank you. Have you had a chance to review Worf's case history
yet? 
RUSSELL: Only briefly. I must admit, I was a little shocked to find the
state of Klingon neurological medicine to be so primitive. 
CRUSHER: It's a cultural bias. When I contacted the Klingon Medical
Division, they informed me that they usually let the patient die in a
case like this. As a result they've done almost no research on
neurological trauma. 
RUSSELL: We'll be in uncharted waters. 
CRUSHER: Worf is having a hard time dealing with his injuries. He's
always been a difficult patient, but now. He's a little tough at first,
but I'm sure you'll get to like him after you get to 
RUSSELL: Doctor, I know that as a starship doctor, you have to maintain
close ties with patients, but I think it would be best if I maintain a
discreet distance. That way, I can give you a completely objective
opinion regarding treatment. 
CRUSHER: Yes. You're probably right. 
RUSSELL: Good. Well, I believe you said I'll be working in medlab four?

CRUSHER: Right. This way.
