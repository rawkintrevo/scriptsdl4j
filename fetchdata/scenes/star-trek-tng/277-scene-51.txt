[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three
time periods is what is causing the anomaly. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Is there any change in the anomaly? 
[Past - Bridge]

DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Disengage the tachyon pulse. 
O'BRIEN: but e haven't finished the scan, sir. 
PICARD: I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage the
tachyon pulse immediately. 
DATA: Aye, sir. Disengaging. 
PICARD: Why isn't the anomaly being affected? 
O'BRIEN: Why would it be, sir?

[Future - Bridge]

PICARD: I've shut off the tachyon pulses in the
other time periods but it hasn't changed the
anomaly. 
DATA: It remains unaffected here as well, sir. 
CRUSHER: What do we do? 
LAFORGE: The only way to stop this thing's to repair the rupture at the
focal point where time and anti-time are converging. 
RIKER: How do we do that? 
DATA: It would require taking the ship into the anomaly itself. Once
inside, we may be able to use the engines to create a static warp
shell. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Data, that's right. And the shell would act as an
artificial subspace barrier separating time and anti-time. 
DATA: Collapsing the anomaly and restoring the normal flow of time. But
this would have to be done in the other two time periods as well. 
PICARD: That could be a problem. The anomaly's so much larger in the
other two time periods
