RIKER CRUSHER WORF PICARD JOHN DATA

[Sickbay - room four]

JOHN: Home? 
PICARD: Yes. Using the information we found in your escape pod, we may
be able to return you to your people. 
JOHN: I cannot go back. 
PICARD: Why is that? 
JOHN: You must not take me home, Captain. 
CRUSHER: John, your memory, has it returned? 
JOHN: All I know is that we came out here to escape. 
PICARD: Escape? 
CRUSHER: There were others with you? 
JOHN: Yes, I was not alone. But what happened to the others, or what we
were escaping from, I cannot remember. But I do know you must not take
me back. Not yet. 
PICARD: We will not arrive in your star system for at least three
weeks. That will give us plenty of time to discuss this further. 
CRUSHER: Hopefully, by then you will have regained more of your memory.

JOHN: You're right, of course, Captain. I apologise for my outburst. 
PICARD: It's understandable. 
(Picard and Beverly leave, and John has another golden glow moment) 
[Ten Forward]

JOHN: This ship is astounding. It seems to stretch
on without end. 
CRUSHER: We can see the rest of it some other time. This is your first
day out of Sickbay and I don't want you to overexert yourself. 
JOHN: This looks like an ideal place to rest. 
CRUSHER: My thoughts exactly. 
JOHN: Truly remarkable. 
CRUSHER: What is? 
JOHN: These people. They're all so different from one another yet they
work together freely. 
CRUSHER: That surprises you? 
JOHN: It is new to me. My people are different somehow. If only I could
remember. Yesterday, for one terrifying moment, there was clarity. 
CRUSHER: You mean the energy pulse? 
JOHN: Yes. For that moment my purpose seemed clear, and then it was
gone. 
CRUSHER: The pain, the energy pulse, must be linked to the cell
mutation in the body. I wish I could help you find the truth. 
JOHN: Beverly, you've done so much for me. I only wish there was some
way I could repay you. 
CRUSHER: But you have. The friendship we've developed has made me very
happy. 
JOHN: The rapport that exists between us also means a great deal to me.
But I am on some kind of journey. Whatever brought me here, whatever is
happening to my body, is all part of that journey. And I must complete
it before any other consideration.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, I am reading a vessel on long range
scanners. It is coming from sector nine five six nine. 
PICARD: What configuration? 
WORF: Impossible to identify at this distance. However, it is on an
intercept course. 
DATA: Captain, the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two. 
RIKER: Warp nine point seven two? 
PICARD: Time to intercept? 
DATA: At present course and speed, ten hours fifty three minutes. 
PICARD: Try and hail them, Mister Worf. 
WORF: No response, Captain. 
PICARD: Keep monitoring their approach. Repeat the hail every half an
hour. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here.
