make pretend library discovered need team report clothing listen

[Bridge]

RIKER: Data, I need help in locating some library
computer information. 
DATA: Specifics, sir? 
RIKER: All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone
taking a shower in his or her clothing. 
DATA: Ah. The body Geordi discovered. 
RIKER: I believe it may have happened before. 
DATA: To someone, somewhere. 
RIKER: This ought to be easy for someone written up in bio-mechanical
texts. 
DATA: About that, sir. Did the Doctor believe I was boasting? 
RIKER: Probably. This may take some time. 
DATA: At least several hours. But what I said was a statement of fact.
Perhaps she will look it up. 
RIKER: You can depend on it.

[Sickbay]

(While Beverly puts the results of her latest scan
into her computer, Geordi takes off his comm. badge and walks out into
the corridor. When she gets there, he is nowhere in sight) 
CRUSHER: Geordi!

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Security. Lieutenant La Forge just left
Sickbay while I was in my office. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: He doesn't have his communicator. It
is very important that we find him. 
TASHA: Security team alert, pick up Lieutenant La Forge. He just left
Sickbay moments ago. Captain, anything further? 
PICARD: Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. 
[Crusher's quarters]

(Geordi is with Wesley, who is showing off his
latest device by floating a chair around the room) 
WESLEY: It's a model of the same kind of tractor beam our ship uses
with a few ideas of my own added. 
LAFORGE: So that's your science project, huh? Wes, you're really
something. 
WESLEY: And since the Captain won't let me on the Bridge, I use this to
imagine I'm there. 
PICARD [OC]: Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirty
seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. 
LAFORGE: It's the Captain's voice. 
WESLEY: It's pieced together from words he's used on the intercom. With
this, I can pretend he's ordering me to take the Enterprise anywhere.
And listen to this, 
PICARD [OC]: Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,
report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: What do you think? 
LAFORGE: I think the Captain's lucky you're on his side. 
WESLEY: But he still won't let me on the Bridge. And there's nothing
there I don't understand. 
LAFORGE: I wish I understood myself that well. 
WESLEY: Are you okay? 
LAFORGE: No, Suddenly I seem to be burning up inside. It's hot in here.
