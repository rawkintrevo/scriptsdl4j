PICARD: Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Is your quarantine intact? 
CRUSHER [OC]: So far, sickbay force fields don't seem to have been
affected. 
PICARD: The boy?

[Sickbay]

(The child is in effectively what is a glass box
the size of a large bed, with it's own ventilation system) 
CRUSHER: He's alright. But he's not going to stay alright. Sir, we have
to get this ship to a starbase medical facility. 
PICARD [OC]: It seems, Doctor

[Engineering]

PICARD: That Data has other plans for the
Enterprise right now.

[Sickbay]

(Beverly is tending to her 'boy in a bubble') 
CRUSHER: Oh, Come on, I can't believe that. Everybody's played a
practical joke on somebody at one time or another. 
WILLIE: Not me. 
CRUSHER: Not even a little one? How about April Fools? I can't believe
that you're telling me that you've never tried to pull something even
on April Fools' Day? 
WILLIE: What for? It's never funny to the one getting fooled. 
CRUSHER: Well, I'm sure your brother didn't intend for it too get out
this of hand. Certainly not to the degree it has. Take a deep breath. 
WILLIE: What's so funny about making someone think you killed them? 
CRUSHER: Take a deep breath. Have you been drinking all the water I
asked you to? 
WILLIE: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Well, keep it up. There might have a short delay in reaching
starbase and I want 
(Troi and Jake enter. Willie turns his back to them) 
JAKE: There, you see? How can I tell him if he's not going to listen to
me? 
TROI: Why don't you try, Jake? 
JAKE: It's just a waste of time. He won't listen. 
(Jake rushes off down the corridor again)

[Bridge]

(The Enterprise has established orbit around a
green world) 
DATA: Computer, prepare to transport me directly to the following
coordinates. 
COMPUTER: Site to site transport interlocks have been manually
deactivated. 
DATA: Can you override? 
COMPUTER: Negative. 
DATA: Show me the shortest route to Transporter room one. Computer,
prepare to activate cascade force field sequence in the following
progression.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: No matter what we try, the computer will
only accept commands from the Bridge, sir. 
WORF: He has blocked every subspace channel, sir. We cannot even call
for help. 
PICARD: Have you tried tracing back navigation inputs? 
WESLEY: We don't even know what star system we're in, sir. 
RIKER: The only way we knew we'd come out of warp was by looking out a
window. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Chief. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Captain, he's up to something. 
PICARD: What now?

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: He discovered the site to site lockout. I
wouldn't be surprised if he
