[Corridor]

(Norah is giving instructions to her silent aide,
Nellen) 
SATIE: Mister Worf has found a brother who still lives on Mars Colony.
Contact someone there and have him interviewed. 
PICARD: Admiral Satie? 
SATIE: And start a background check into all his friends at the Academy
training programme. 
PICARD: Admiral Satie? 
SATIE: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: I would like to have a word with you. 
SATIE: Of course. 
PICARD: In private and off the record. 
SATIE: Of course. After all, you are my partner in this.

[Ready room]

SATIE: I cannot possibly believe you mean this. 
PICARD: But I do. This must stop. It has gone too far. You lied to him
about the Engine Room. There were no volatile chemicals found there. 
SATIE: It was a tactic. A way of applying pressure. 
PICARD: We are hounding an innocent man. 
SATIE: And how, may I ask, have you managed to determine that? 
PICARD: I've talked with him. 
SATIE: I see. And he told you he was a victim of circumstance,
blameless and pure. 
PICARD: No, he admits his mistake in falsifying his application. That
does not make him a traitor. 
SATIE: How can you be so incredibly naive? Captain, may I tell you how
I've spent the last four years? From planet to Starbase to planet. I
have no home. I live on starships and shuttlecraft. I haven't seen a
family member in years. I have no friends. But I have a purpose. My
father taught me from the time I was a little girl still clutching a
blanket, that the United Federation of Planets is the most remarkable
institution ever conceived. And it is my cause to make sure that this
extraordinary union be preserved. I cannot imagine why you are trying
to block this investigation. There have been others in the past who
doubted me. They came to regret it. 
PICARD: The hearings on Simon Tarses will stop. If necessary, I will go
to Starfleet Command. 
SATIE: I have news for you, Captain. I've been in constant contact with
Starfleet Command. The hearings are not going to stop. They're going to
be expanded. 
PICARD: What are you saying? 
SATIE: I'm going to get to the heart of this conspiracy if it means
investigating every last person on this ship. And every hearing from
now on will be held in the presence of Admiral Thomas Henry of
Starfleet Security. I've requested he be brought here at once. 
PICARD: You never told me about this. 
SATIE: I report to Starfleet Command directly. I do not need your
permission or your approval for my decisions. 
PICARD: Admiral, what you're doing here is unethical. It's immoral.
I'll fight it. 
SATIE: Do what you must, Captain. And so will I.
