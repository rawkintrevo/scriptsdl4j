TROI LIATOR PICARD RIVAN RIKER BEVERLY CRUSHER

[Council Chambers]

PICARD: Would you care to comment privately how you
read any of this? 
TROI: Unnecessary, sir. These people are honest, almost to a fault. And
they have great pride in their ways. 
LIATOR: You're the Captain. We're ready. This way, please. 
(Benches have been arranged in a circle. Picard has a chair to himself)

LIATOR: Welcome to our world, Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
LIATOR: We regret that our system of justice is troubling you. 
PICARD: The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? 
RIKER: In accord with the Prime Directive, I've allowed them to hold
him pending the outcome of this. 
RIVAN: He is safe and unharmed. We promise that. Captain Picard, I do
not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you
respect such things. 
PICARD: We do. 
LIATOR: Good, so do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long
ago. The tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by
our laws. 
RIVAN: We are a people of law. They do sometimes bring us sadness, but
we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. 
PICARD: They haven't always, but now they do. 
LIATOR: Do you execute criminals? 
PICARD: No, not any longer. 
RIVAN: But you did once? 
PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then 
RIVAN: But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? 
PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned to
detect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in our
world, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. 
LIATOR: So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are
advanced in other ways too, I suggest you use your superior powers to
rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal out
of our reach, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of
this backward little world. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. 
RIVAN: Riker has explained it to us. 
PICARD: Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? 
LIATOR: Until sundown? 
RIVAN: Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the
law. But we must act by sundown. 
PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circling
high above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object.
A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real.
At least, it's not completely solid. 
RIVAN: Do you mean God? 
PICARD: God? 
LIATOR: God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. 
PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? 
RIVAN: As you just did. As existing both here and in another place
also. 
LIATOR: But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt
most fully. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, come in please. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
BEVERLY [OC]: CMO Crusher, sir. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: Commander Data has just regained
consciousness. 
PICARD [OC]: What condition? Can he talk? 
BEVERLY: He's insisting on it, sir. Urgently.

[Council Chamber]

TROI: (whispers) Wesley. 
PICARD: Stand by. Picard out. I want to speak to her personally about
her son. So you promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown? 
LIATOR: You have our word. 
PICARD: Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel? 
RIVAN: Of course. I'll go as a hostage for the boy's safety. 
PICARD: No, no, no. That's not it. I want you to identify something for
me, if you can. Captain to Transporter Room. Three to beam up. 
(Picard, Troi and Rivan move away from the group) 
RIVAN: I'm frightened. 
TROI: There's no reason to be. 
PICARD: Transporter Room, energise.

[Corridor]

RIVAN: But this is a city. A great city. 
CRUSHER: Captain, I've just seen the away team report about Wesley. 
PICARD: In a moment, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: In a moment? 
PICARD: Exactly. In a moment. You were about to say? 
RIVAN: Since you have all this power, why be concerned about our laws?
You could take the boy from us. 
PICARD: It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can see
whatever is outside this vessel. 
RIVAN: Do you mean my world? You said we'd be high above it. 
PICARD: And something else that's circling your world. It's very
important to us, and perhaps to you, to know what it is.
