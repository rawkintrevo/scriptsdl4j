TROI DATA RIKER

[Corridor]

TROI: I heard about Data. 
RIKER: Yeah. 
TROI: It's having an unusually traumatic effect on everyone. 
RIKER: Yeah. 
TROI: If you don't want to talk about it, it's okay. 
RIKER: I'm fine. I'm just 
TROI: Angry. 
RIKER: I'm not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. Why should I be angry? 
TROI: Maybe because it reminds us of our own mortality. 
RIKER: I just don't want to believe it. 
TROI: Have you ever heard Data define friendship? 
RIKER: No. 
TROI: How did he put it? As I experience certain sensory input
patterns, my mental pathways become accustomed to them. The inputs
eventually are anticipated and even missed when absent. 
RIKER: So what's the point? 
TROI: He's used to us, and we're used to him. It's like finding out
someone you love has a terminal illness and 
(The turbolift arrives, the doors open and - ) 
RIKER: Data. 
DATA: Counsellor. Commander.

[Turbolift]

DATA: Would either of you mind if I made a personal
inquiry? 
TROI: Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. 
DATA: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behave
toward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when I
appear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that an
accurate observation? 
RIKER: Not at all. 
TROI: (same time) Yes. 
RIKER: Yes. 
TROI: You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. 
RIKER: It's just that our mental pathways have become accustomed to
your sensory input patterns. 
DATA: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well,
Counsellor.
