PICARD RIKER BROSSMER DATA

[Transporter room]

BROSSMER: Aye, sir. 
(She activates the controls and things fizzle) 
BROSSMER: What the hell? Engineering, I need more power to the primary
energising coil. Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm losing them I have to
abort. 
[Romulan Engineering]

BROSSMER [OC]: They should be returning to your
coordinates, sir. 
RIKER: Chief, do you have them? They're not here. 
BROSSMER [OC]: No, sir. 
RIKER: Where are they? 
[Transporter room]

BROSSMER: I can't locate their patterns. 
[Romulan Engineering]

BROSSMER [OC]: We've lost them, sir. 
[Bridge]

BROSSMER [OC]: I've done all I can, sir. I'm afraid
they're gone. 
PICARD: Mister Data, begin a level one diagnostic. All transporter
systems offline until further notice. Could they have materialised
somewhere else? 
DATA: Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to locate them anywhere
within transporter range. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
(Troi shakes her head) 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Enterprise. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

[Romulan Engineering]

RIKER: Captain, we're still looking at a core
breach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator.
