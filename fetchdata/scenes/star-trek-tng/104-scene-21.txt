RIKER TASHA PICARD HAGON CHIEF LUTAN CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

(Wesley enters, shyly) 
RIKER: Care to lend a hand? Sit at Ops. 
[Transporter Room]

(Data beams aboard) 
DATA: Was I seen leaving? 
CHIEF: They've got eyes only for the programme. 
(Riker and Crusher enter) 
DATA: Captain Picard wanted no risk of our communications being
overheard. You are to proceed now as he indicated. 
CRUSHER: Captain's orders too. 
RIKER: Does the Captain understand what you and Geordi reported about
those weapons? They're razor sharp, split-second lethal. 
DATA: I'm here to brief you on what he plans.

[Centreplace]

(The Starfleet group enter, Tasha is wearing the
weapon glove) 
TASHA: Any last minute instructions, sir? 
PICARD: Stay alive. We'll hope to do the rest. 
(Yareena enters)
HAGON: I speak for Lutan. The rules are known. Let combat continue
until there is a victor. It will not be interrupted. 
(Yareena goes on the offensive straight away. Tasha pushes her weapon
away and it hits one of the vertical laser beams. It flies off
Yareena's hand into the lap of a spectator)
LUTAN: Combatants, hold your positions. Return the weapon. 
(The spectator dies of his wound and is dragged away. Yareena is given
the glove back and she returns to the business of trying to kill Tasha.
Tasha manages to make Yareena loose her balance) 
HAGON: Careful, Yareena. 
(Finally the two women get into very close combat, and Tasha lands a
blow on Yareena's back. Then she lies across the body and the two are
beamed away)
