WORF: We are picking up a subspace signal, Captain.
Sensors indicate a small spacecraft ahead. 
LAFORGE: The configuration is unfamiliar. Nothing in our database comes
close. 
WORF: Within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(vaguely triangular with green lights) 
PICARD: Analysis, Mister Worf. 
WORF: No discernable armament. Reading one lifeform aboard. 
PICARD: Hail the vessel. 
WORF: No response, Captain. 
LAFORGE: We're being scanned. It's not like any sensor system I've ever
seen. Shall we raise shields? 
PICARD: No, let's begin this with a show of good faith. 
WORF: Sir, the scans are now matching the frequency of our optical data
network. It could be an attempt to access our computer system. 
LAFORGE: Scanning intensity has increased by fifteen hundred percent. 
PICARD: Shields up.

(at the bar) 
DATA: One Samarian Sunset, made in the traditional style. 
(Data puts a glass of clear liquid in front of Deanna, then taps it
with his fingernail. A yellow glow diffuses into orange in the glass) 
TROI: It's beautiful. 
DATA: I hope you enjoy it. 
(a green light passes across Data) 
DATA: I hope you enjoy it.
