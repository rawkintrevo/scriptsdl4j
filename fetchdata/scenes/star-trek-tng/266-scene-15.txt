[Graveyard]

LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise. We're ready down
here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
(the coffin is beamed out of the grave without the pile of soil
collapsing, and they
lift the lid off to reveal a white haired old lady) 
DATA: I am reading definite signs of anaphasic energy in her body. It
appears to extend to the cellular level. 
LAFORGE: That's impossible. She wasn't anywhere near the weather
station when Quint was killed. She died of natural causes. 
DATA: I suggest we run a deep tissue scan to look for any signs of 
(Felicia opens her bright green eyes, sits up and zaps the pair of
them) 
CRUSHER: No! Ronin, stop this. Stop this, please. 
GUEST1: Beverly, it's all right. Have trust in me. 
CRUSHER: You're not Nana. Nana's dead. Leave her alone! 
(green comes out of Felisa and the corpse falls back. Ronin appears.) 
GUEST3: Beverly! Forgive me. These men were trying to stop us from being
together. Once they're gone, everything will be right. 
CRUSHER: No, it won't. You've been infusing me with the same sort of
anaphasic energy that killed Quint. 
GUEST3: He was trying to destroy me. I had to defend myself. My love. I
could never harm you. I am here to protect you. 
CRUSHER: No, you're not. There's no such thing as a ghost. You are some
sort of anaphasic lifeform. Anaphasic energy is extremely unstable. It
needs an organic host in order to maintain molecular cohesion or else
you'll die. Isn't that right? 
GUEST3: Beverly. 
CRUSHER: I also scanned the candle. The flame is plasma based. You were
using it as a receptacle for yourself in order to get to me, in order
to merge with me. You have been using me, Nana, my entire family for
centuries. 
GUEST3: And I loved all of them! And they loved me. Give me the candle,
Beverly. 
CRUSHER: No. No. 
(Ronin gives Geordi another zap) 
GUEST3: Put it down, or I will kill him. Set it down and walk away. 
(Beverly puts it down then grabs Geordi's phaser and destroys it) 
GUEST3: No! 
CRUSHER: (into Geordi's comm. badge) Crusher to Riker. Will, close off
all the plasma conduits in the weather control system. I'll explain
later. 
RIKER [OC]: Understood. 
CRUSHER: You've nowhere left to go. 
GUEST3: Yes, I do. 
CRUSHER: Keep away from me. 
(Crusher shoots him) 
GUEST3: Beverly. I love you. Beverly. 
(he runs at her and she destroys him)

Captain's log, supplemental. Commander La Forge and
Mister Data have recovered from their exposure to the anaphasic energy,
but I'm afraid Doctor Crusher's recovery will be of a more personal
nature.
