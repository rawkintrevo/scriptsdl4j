PICARD KELSEY NEIL

[Engineering]

KELSEY: What makes you think I'm a terrorist? 
[Worf's quarters]

PICARD: Trilithium resin is a highly toxic waste
product produced by our engines. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: It's only possible use could be as a
weapon. 
KELSEY: You might be right, Mister Mot, but we've been planning this
for a long time, and I doubt that you'll really be able to stop us. 
(mouths 'find him' to Pomet)
KELSEY: Or even slow us down. 
(Picard sets out with Worf's crossbow) 
NEIL: There. Three hundred milligrams of trilithium. I'm using a
dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod. There. That should keep the
resin stable enough for transport. 
KELSEY: Come on! Don't be so tense, Neil. If something goes wrong, you
won't have time to worry about it. Let's go. 
(in Sickbay, Picard dips the tip of the crossbow bolt into a liquid)

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: Three more decks, then we take corridor
fifteen B all the way to Ten Forward. 
(She stops climbing. The next set of ladders is missing.) 
NEIL: What's wrong? 
KELSEY: We have to find another way up. The rungs are cut. 
[Sickbay]

(Picard is mixing up ingredients) 
KELSEY [OC]: That wasn't very clever, Mister Mot.

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: If you knew where we were, you should have
attacked us. Now we'll just take another route. One you might not be
able 
[Sickbay]

KELSEY [OC]: To predict. 
PICARD: There are only so many ways to Ten Forward. Ten Forward is the
logical place to be if you want to stay ahead of the baryon sweep. 
[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: That sweep is just as big a threat to you
as it is to us. In fact, if I were you, Mister Mot 
[Sickbay]

KELSEY [OC]: I'd be trying to find a way off this
ship. 
(Picard's test concoction flares nicely) 
PICARD: I plan on leaving the same way you do. On your ship.
