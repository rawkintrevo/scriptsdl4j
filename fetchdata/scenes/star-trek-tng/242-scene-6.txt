[Replimat]

(a very wrinkled alien with the voice of the modern
Zephram Cochrane approaches Worf while he is still eating the dodgy

SHREK: Klingon. You are Starfleet Klingon. 
WORF: I am Lieutenant Worf. 
SHREK: Worf. Son of Mogh. 
WORF: What of it? 
SHREK: I am Jaglom Shrek, a man with information to sell.

WORF: Where is this planet?

you for spreading lies about my family. My father was killed defending
Khitomer.

Rudman on board the Merrimac as soon as you 
WORF: I am well aware of your request, Commander. 
RIKER: Lieutenant, are you all right? 
WORF: Yes, sir. I am fine. I will send your schedule, sir. Excuse me.
