(Geordi is suffering, and holding his side) 
LAFORGE: Hey, let me talk to him. I'll get you their computer banks. 
GREBNEDLOG: We want to be smart. 
LAFORGE: So open the hailing frequency. They'll listen to me. 
GREBNEDLOG: We are smart. 
REGINOD: We need their computer things. 
GREBNEDLOG: Yes. Yes. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Commander Riker? 
RIKER: Yes, Lieutenant, we're here. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: The Pakleds seem pretty sincere. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We want what we want. 
RIKER: Our computer banks are non-negotiable. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We want them. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Believe me, they're nothing if not persistent.

GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We want to be nothing if not persistent. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Nobody ever said they were great
conversationalists. 
RIKER: Where did they get their shields? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Yes. We like shields. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Well, from what I've seen, half the systems on
this ship have been stolen from Romulans, Klingons, Jarada, just about
anybody they've ever came in contact with. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We like to be smart. 
RIKER: Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge. They steal technology. 
DATA: But they lack the ability to use it properly. 
RIKER: You're an excellent Chief Engineer, Lieutenant La Forge. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: And of course your knowledge of phaser and photon weaponry is
unmatched. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: That's nice of you to say, sir, but really
Lieutenant Worf 
RIKER: Our missions are always inherently dangerous, and any of us
could be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice at any time. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir, but 
RIKER: Speaking of time. This may be your time. I shall personally miss
you. 
DATA: Goodbye, Geordi. I shall miss you at weapons systems analysis. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: And I guess you'll just have to arm your
photon torpedo countdowns without me. 
DATA: As well as our hydrogen collectors. Fond farewell. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: He knows about weapons. 
REGINOD [on viewscreen]: You can make us strong. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: It's not something I really like to talk
about. 
WORF: Any classified weapons knowledge you share with your captors will
be considered treason. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: But I may have no choice. 
WORF: You will die without honour. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Thanks a lot, Worf. 
WORF: You will never attain the twenty fourth level of awareness. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Twenty-four? That's quite a challenge. 
WORF: Indeed. Twenty four is the gateway to heroic salvation. 
(transmission ends) 
PULASKI: Do you think he understands? 
RIKER: He'd better. 
TROI: He's afraid. 
RIKER: We all are, Counsellor.

[Pakled ship]

GREBNEDLOG: You are smart. 
LAFORGE: Not smart enough. I'm still here. 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: I thought you wanted me to help you go. Why don't we work on
that guidance system, okay? 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong, or die.

[Starbase 515 Operating Theatre]

SURGEON: It's not working. Something's wrong. The
metabolation occlusions aren't holding. Damn it! I can't stop the
heterocyclic declination. Fuse. 
(laser beams fire down) 
SURGEON: Again! We need a biomolecular physiologist in here. This man
is dying. 
MEDIC: Right away, sir.
