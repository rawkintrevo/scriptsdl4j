DATA: I have been exploring the possibility of
using a tractor beam to pull the Raman from the atmosphere. However,
the high level of interference prevents a positive lock. 
RIKER: If we set up some sort of relay system? 
DATA: That is my conclusion as well, Commander. Two shuttlecraft,
staggered between the Enterprise and the Raman, with their shields
adjusted to refocus the tractor beam. 
PICARD: Can we get the shuttles close enough without danger? Mister La
Forge. 
LAFORGE: Sure. Yeah. As long as we keep them both above the
troposphere, that'll be all right. 
PICARD: Then in that case 
LAFORGE: But what about the Hera? We'd be leaving my mother and her
crew stranded on the planet. 
PICARD: Commander. 
LAFORGE: I've been thinking about this. A couple of weeks ago I got a
message from my mother. She said she had a new Chief Engineer who had
been experimenting with the warp drive. Now, I've seen the Hera. It
uses trionic initiators in the warp coil. They have a reputation
of strange side effects, especially when you start playing around with
them. 
DATA: There have been reports of warp bubbles and other subspace
deformations. 
LAFORGE: So, what if that's what happened? Not a warp bubble, but a
subspace funnel. 
RIKER: Connecting two points through subspace? 
LAFORGE: Well the Hera could have accidentally created a distortion
that emptied out right here at Marijne Seven. 
PICARD: Why here? 
LAFORGE: The Hera passed near this planet just ten days ago. There's an
awful lot of subspace disturbance in the atmosphere. The ship could've
accidentally picked up some residual traces that directed the funnel
right back here. 
RIKER: So the Hera's in one piece somewhere out there? 
LAFORGE: Maybe it's being surrounded by some kind of warp field, but
who knows for how long? 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, do you have any evidence to support this
hypothesis? 
LAFORGE: I did pick up some pretty strange subspace readings when I was
interfaced with the probe. 
RIKER: Geordi, that could have been anything. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but I talked to her, Commander. She asked me to bring
the Raman closer to the planet. 
PICARD: Mister Data, is any of this possible? 
DATA: Yes, sir. However, it is highly unlikely. 
PICARD: How unlikely? 
DATA: Nearly impossible, sir. 
PICARD: let's proceed with the shuttle plan. 
LAFORGE: Captain 
PICARD: Dismissed. Mister La Forge. 
(Riker and Data leave) 
PICARD: I want you to know that I am not unsympathetic to what you're
going through. Your mother's disappearance is tragic, but I cannot risk
your safety on the basis of a dubious hypothesis. 
LAFORGE: Captain, if I'm right and there's just one chance in a million
that she's alive 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Geordi. My decision is made. 
LAFORGE: I understand, sir.
