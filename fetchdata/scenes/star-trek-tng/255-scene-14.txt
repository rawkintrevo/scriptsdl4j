control ve ah contact shouldn decided lot sorry talk

[La Forge's quarters]

(Geordi is watching an old letter) 
SILVA [on monitor]: I saw your father last week and your sister about
ten days before that. I decided I missed my favourite son. 
LAFORGE: Your only son, Ma. 
SILVA [on monitor]: You're going to have to see the Hera again. We've
got a lot of new faces on board, including a Chief Engineer who juices
up the nacelles every chance she gets. I think she's the best
technician in the fleet. Okay, second best. 
(doorbell) 
LAFORGE: Come in. 
RIKER: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were 
LAFORGE: Don't worry about it. 
SILVA [on monitor]: Maybe you should meet her. We're going to be in the
same sector next week. Take a shuttle over and I'll introduce you. 
LAFORGE: My mother's always trying to find me a wife. 
SILVA [on monitor]: But if you're too busy, I'll see you at your
father's birthday party. Remember, if you talk to him it's a surprise. 
(message ends) 
LAFORGE: This came in about three weeks ago. I never got back to her. 
RIKER: Geordi, the probe has entered the planet's atmosphere and I'm
ready to take it onto the ship. If you would like to take a couple of
days off, I'll run the interface. 
LAFORGE: The interface is calibrated specifically to my visor's inputs.
It would take you at least ten hours to convert it, and those crewmen
down there can't wait. 
RIKER: The interface doesn't have to be fully compatible. I could run
it right now. I wouldn't have the same control that you have, but it
would still work. 
LAFORGE: Forget it. I'm the best person for the job, and there's no
reason why we shouldn't proceed as planned. 
RIKER: The Hera is reason enough. 
LAFORGE: The Hera is missing, that's all. Now until I hear something
different, my mother might just as well have taken the crew on an
unscheduled holiday. Let's go.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Captain, the probe is through the airlock
and in position aboard the Raman. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Data. Report.

[Laboratory]

DATA: We are ready to bring the interface online,
sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Proceed. 
DATA: Activating the remote sensors. Initiating interface now. 
CRUSHER: Vital signs normal. Geordi, how do you feel? 
LAFORGE: Fine. 
DATA: Do you have visual contact? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. 
[Raman corridor]

LAFORGE: Data, turn up the input sensors. I'm not
seeing anything. 
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged. 
LAFORGE: Okay, I can see. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: But no colours. 
DATA: Increasing signal strength to seventy five percent of tolerance. 
LAFORGE: Ah, that's better. 
CRUSHER: Your pulse has gone up. Your nervous system probably has to
get used to the input levels. 
LAFORGE: I'm excited, that's all, Doctor. This is like being on a
roller coaster. Or a first date. I'm all right. 
CRUSHER: I'll be the judge of that. If your heart rate gets too high,
we're going to disconnect you. 
LAFORGE: Understood.
