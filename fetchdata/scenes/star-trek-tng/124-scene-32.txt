(Data arrives safely) 
DATA: Enterprise. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard. 
DATA: I am proceeding to the lab, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Maintain an open frequency, Mister Data.

(Then he has to dodge a laser beam and take out the emitters)

[Bridge]

 PICARD: Mister Data, what's going on? 
[Vandor corridor]

DATA: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of his
security precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. 
[Laboratory]

(The code works, but the fluorescent tubes only
open part way. Data enters cautiously. In the centre is a distortion)
PICARD [OC]: Mister Data, this channel will remain open. Please
continue to report. 
DATA: This appears to be the instrument Doctor Manheim described. It
should confirm when the next time effect will occur. 
RIKER [OC]: Data?

[Bridge]

RIKER: Did Manheim give you enough information to
decipher the security code? 
[Laboratory]

DATA: I will know in a moment, sir. According to
calculations, the next time effect will occur in one minute thirty
seconds. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: What's the next step, Mister Data?
