(at evening meal) 
TALUR: It's perfectly understandable. Your people probably all have
great strength. It will allow them to fight off the ferocious creatures
that live in the Vellorian Mountains. 
DATA: You have told me no one from the village has ever been to the
Vellorian Mountains. How can you be certain there are ferocious
creatures there? 
TALUR: It's a well known fact. 
DATA: But no one has actually seen one? 
TALUR: Well, not to my knowledge, but 
GIA: Father, are you all right? 
GARVIN: I've been tired since this afternoon. I'm sure it's nothing. 
TALUR: You feel slightly warm. Some fresh air and a brisk walk will do
you good. 
GARVIN: That sounds like a good idea. I'll be back soon. 
(Garvin and Talur leave) 
GIA: You didn't like it? 
DATA: I neither liked it nor disliked it. I simply had no appetite. 
GIA: Father's cooking isn't as good as mother's. He tries, though. 
DATA: Where is your mother? 
GIA: She died about a year ago. Father says she went to a beautiful
place where everything is peaceful and everyone loves each other, and
no one ever gets sick. Do you think there's really a place like that? 
(Data gazes out at the moon and stars) 
DATA: Yes. I do.
