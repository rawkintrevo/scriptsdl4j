PICARD SCIENTIST DATA

[Cavern] 
SCIENTIST: Work crews were down here installing
seismic regulators when they found some remarkable artefacts. 
PICARD: And it's been determined that they date back to the late
nineteenth century? 
SCIENTIST: Yes. 
(he takes a sheet off a packing case to reveal the items) 
DATA: The bifocal vision aid is typical of the era. The weapon is a
forty five calibre double-action cavalry pistol invented by Colt
Firearms in 1873. 
SCIENTIST: Here, look inside the watch. 
(an engraving - To S.L.C., with love. 30 November, 1889). 
PICARD: What makes you think that extraterrestrials are related to
these discoveries. 
SCIENTIST: The crew was having a problem with the regulators. Something
inside the cavern was interfering with the phase conditioners. It
turned out to be the cavern itself. 
(Data gets out his tricorder) 
DATA: The composition of the exposed rock face has been altered by
exposure to triolic waves. 
SCIENTIST: Which you're not going to find on Earth in either the
nineteenth or twenty fourth century. 
PICARD: Triolic waves? 
DATA: The by-product of an energy source employed by very few species
because of its deleterious effect on living tissue. 
SCIENTIST: We've confirmed that no one has been in or out of this
cavern in centuries, so we're left with a five hundred year old
mystery. 
PICARD: I'm curious, Doctor. There are far greater experts on Earth to
investigate your mystery. Why bring the Enterprise all the way home? 
SCIENTIST: As we continued our excavation, we found one other thing I
haven't shown you yet. We've tried to leave everything as we found it. 
(and he uncovers - Data's head)

Captain's log, stardate 45960.2. We have
transported the materials discovered in the cavern back to the ship for
analysis. I wish I could be as dispassionate about the implications as
my second officer.
