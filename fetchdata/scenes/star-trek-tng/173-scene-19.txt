[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Security.

[Shuttlebay]

(Two engineers are working on the El-Baz) 
LAFORGE: Okay, let's realign the magnetic inducer on the starboard
nacelle. 
(John appears in the control gallery. Beverly, Worf and two guards
enter the main bay) 
CRUSHER: John! 
WORF: Leave the control booth immediately! 
(Worf goes up to the gallery as John succeeds in opening the bay doors)

CRUSHER: John, listen to me. You must come down. I'll try to help you. 
WORF: Step away from the controls. 
JOHN: Get back. Please, stay away. 
WORF: I have no wish to harm you, but you must return to Sickbay
immediately. 
JOHN: No. Do not come any closer. I cannot control over what is
happening to me. 
(There is a massive golden glow that is bigger than John and pushes
Worf over the railing) 
CRUSHER: His neck is broken. No life signs. Sickbay, form a
resuscitation team. I have a code seven in shuttlebay two. Transporter
room, stand by. 
SECURITY: Hold it. 
CRUSHER: No, don't. 
(John has come down. He sends a glow through Worf, who comes back to
life) 
CRUSHER: Hold still. 
LAFORGE: Doc. 
CRUSHER: I can't believe it. There's no trace of injury.

[Ready room]

(John is stiff and uncomfortable on a chair) 
PICARD: You admit you were trying to steal a shuttlecraft. 
JOHN: Yes. 
PICARD: So I ask you again, why? 
JOHN: I don't know. 
PICARD: Unacceptable. You had a reason. I want to know what it was.
Damn it, you nearly killed a member of my crew. 
CRUSHER: And healed him. 
PICARD: I'm not forgetting that. That's the reason he's here and not in
the brig. 
JOHN: I warned him. I told him it was dangerous. 
PICARD: Why? Why was it dangerous? What is happening to you? 
JOHN: I don't know. 
CRUSHER: The rate of metamorphosis is accelerating. It's almost as if
your body were generating an electrical field that's warping the
tissue. 
PICARD: Who are you? What are you? 
JOHN: I'm afraid. For myself. For all of you. I have to get away.
Isolate myself. Whatever is happening to me, it's dangerous. 
PICARD: As Lieutenant Worf discovered. 
JOHN: I don't want to hurt anyone. Captain, for the sake of your crew,
let me go before this happens again. 
CRUSHER: John, I don't believe you're capable of harming any 
DATA [OC]: Captain, the alien vessel is coming within weapons range.
Its shields are up. 
PICARD: I'm on my way. I want him kept under constant surveillance.
