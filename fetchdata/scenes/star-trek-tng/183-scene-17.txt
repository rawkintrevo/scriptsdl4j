fait don bon primary coordinates way claimed tell sonodanite

 [Bridge]

RIKER: Are you certain? 
DATA: It is definitely debris. The primary material is duranium, with
smaller proportions of sonodanite and ermanium. 
LAFORGE: Most shuttlecraft hulls are made of duranium. 
CRUSHER: Then they're gone. 
DATA: Not necessarily, Doctor. There is far too little debris to
account for an entire shuttlecraft. 
RIKER: So what is it? 
LAFORGE: You know, Dirgo had his manoeuvring thrusters rigged a funny
way. Claimed it was more efficient. If one of them blew it might have
left debris like that. 
RIKER: If only one of his thrusters was out, he could still have set
down somewhere. 
DATA: The only Class M planets in the system are Pentarus two and five,
both of which have been thoroughly searched by the miners. 
RIKER: Then we'll search them again. 
DATA: Sir, there are also four moons in the Pentarus system that could
support life. 
RIKER: Have the miners searched them? 
WORF: Not yet, sir. 
RIKER: Which one is the closest one to the debris coordinates? 
DATA: Lambda Paz, one of the moons of Pentarus three. 
RIKER: Set a course, Ensign.

[Cave]

PICARD: Aupres de ma blonde, il fait bon, fait bon,
fait bon. Ensign, where are we? 
WESLEY: We crashed, sir. We're in a cave. 
PICARD: I need water. 
WESLEY: Sir, we don't have any water. Don't you remember? We tried to
get to the fountain and Captain Dirgo 
PICARD: Yes, I remember. 
WESLEY: I think I'm on to something. I've analysed the sentry's energy
patterns. 
PICARD: Wesley, I may not make it. 
WESLEY: I've taken the transponder element from my communicator and
I've used it to modify my tricorder. 
PICARD: No, listen. 
WESLEY: I think I can use it to interrupt the sentry's electrical
pattern. Stop it, maybe slow it down. 
PICARD: Listen to me. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: There's so much I wanted to tell you. The Academy, there's
someone, someone who meant a great deal to me. He's been there forever.
Someone you must get to know. His name is Boothby. Now, you tell him
that you and I were friends. Now, when I was there, he helped me.
Listen to him. 
WESLEY: What does he teach? 
PICARD: He's the groundskeeper. One of the wisest men I ever knew. Oh,
I envy you, Wesley Crusher. You're just at the beginning of the
adventure. Go on. Get the water. Stay alive. They'll find you. 
WESLEY: I'll be back soon. 
PICARD: Of course. Wesley. You remember I was always proud of you.
