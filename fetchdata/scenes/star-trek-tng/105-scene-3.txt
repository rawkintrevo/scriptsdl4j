(Riker is relaxing to a holographic pair of women
playing musical instruments) 
TASHA [OC]: Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker, your presence is
requested in Transporter room one. 
RIKER: Sorry ladies. Duty calls.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: You needed me, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Yes, sir. There's an object of some kind beaming in from Haven. 
RIKER: What is it? 
TASHA: We're not sure. 
CHIEF: Surface Station approval coming in now, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: All right, let's bring it in. 
(It's a box, with a face in relief on the front of it) 
RIKER: Odd looking. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: What's going on? 
(The face on the box comes alive) 
FACE: I hold a message for Deanna Troi. Lwaxana Troi and the honourable
Miller family will soon arrive. The momentous day is close at hand.
Rejoice. 
TROI: No. No. 
RIKER: What's going on? 
(The box bursts open and scatters gems on the transporter pad) 
TASHA: Jewels. Look at these jewels. 
TROI: They're bonding gifts. What you would call wedding presents. 
RIKER: Who's getting married? 
TROI: I am.

[Ready room]

TROI: I was certain it would never happen, Captain.
The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me away
from home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoid
tradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. 
RIKER: Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human 
PICARD: Will you and your husband be staying with the ship, Counsellor?

TROI: No, sir. 
PICARD: Then I'll just say congratulations for now, Deanna. You'll
excuse me? 
(Picard leaves) 
TROI: Bill, more than anything else in the world, anything, you want to
be a starship captain. True? 
RIKER: That's not all I want, Deanna. 
TROI: I can feel that. I know you care, within those limits. Did you
hear what I said? 
RIKER: Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry. 
TROI: Come dance at my wedding. 
RIKER: I'll try. 
(Riker leaves as Data enters) 
DATA: A message from planet Haven, Counsellor. They wish to beam the
Miller wedding party aboard.
