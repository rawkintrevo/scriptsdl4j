OMAG RIKER WORF PICARD ENSIGN TROI DATA

[Bridge]


WORF [OC]: Has just entered the establishment.
RIKER: Is that Melor Famagal I hear?
WORF [OC]: It is.
RIKER: I'm on my way.

[Piano bar]

OMAG: Where's the waiter? Is there a waiter in this
sorry place?
RIKER: Is there a problem?
OMAG: Yes. I need more napkins.
RIKER: Use your sleeve.
OMAG: What did you say?
RIKER: Or use one of their sleeves, I don't care.
OMAG: Who are you?
RIKER: Commander William Riker, USS Enterprise.
OMAG: Am I supposed to stand up and salute?
RIKER: We're investigating the disappearance of a Vulcan ship. 
OMAG: Well you've got the wrong Ferengi. I never trade in Vulcan ships.

RIKER: We know that you're involved. 
OMAG: Who would want a Vulcan ship? Vulcans are pacifists. I deal in
warships. Can somebody get me a napkin?
RIKER: Who would want a Vulcan ship?
OMAG: Hypothetically speaking? 
RIKER: Hypothetically speaking.
OMAG: I never learned to speak hypothetical.
(so Riker tips Omag's dinner onto his lap then grabs him by his lapels)

OMAG: Are you crazy?
RIKER: Let me explain what'll happen to you if you don't tell me about
the Vulcan ship. Your right of passage
through this sector will be revoked and more than that, I will be very
unhappy.
OMAG: I delivered it to a Barolian freighter. 
RIKER: At what coordinates?
OMAG: I don't remember. Ow! Watch it! You're stretching my neck.
RIKER: Co-ordinates?
OMAG: At Galorndon Core. Near the Neutral Zone. That's all I know. I
swear it.
RIKER: Enjoy your dinner.

RIKER: As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was at
the Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: And the Romulans are suddenly very interested
in bonding with the Vulcans. Spock has been meeting with the new Senate
Proconsul about reunification. 
RIKER: Reunification?
PICARD [on viewscreen]: The Proconsul says that he is prepared to
endorse peace talks. 
RIKER: And Spock?
PICARD [on viewscreen]: The Ambassador is sceptical, but he cares a
great deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success,
he's prepared to pursue it.
TROI: I'm afraid I don't see how a stolen Vulcan ship fits into all
this. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Neither do I, Counsellor. How soon can you be
at Galorndon Core, Number One?
RIKER: A little over eight hours.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Well, this may prove to be a wild goose chase,
but I don't see that we have any other choice, do you?
RIKER: Agreed.
DATA: We are losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: We'll advise you further as soon as you reach
your destination, Number One. Picard out.
(transmission ends)
RIKER: Ensign, set a course to Galorndon Core. Take us to warp eight. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.
