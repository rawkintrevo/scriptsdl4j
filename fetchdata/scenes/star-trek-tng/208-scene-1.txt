PICARD RIKER

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: We'll be coming into orbit of Vulcan in less
than an hour, Captain. 
PICARD: We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans. 
RIKER: Already been taken care of. She's transporting over at oh seven
hundred. 
PICARD: And Sarek?
RIKER: She says he's too ill to make the trip. 
PICARD: The man is dying. And it's my honour to tell him that his son
may have betrayed the Federation.
RIKER: How well do you know Spock? 
PICARD: I met him once. What I know of him comes from history books,
and of course my mind meld with his father. 
RIKER: That must cover a lot of ground. 
PICARD: Not as much as you'd imagine. Sarek and Spock. Well, sometimes,
fathers and sons. 
RIKER: Understood.
PICARD: Oh, one other thing. Take a look at this. Turned up during an
intelligence sweep. 
(Picard hands over a PADD) 
RIKER: Metal fragments. 
PICARD: What do you make of it?
RIKER: Possibly disassembled components, identified as Vulcan,
recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel? 
PICARD: They were found in crates marked Medical Supplies.
RIKER: Contraband. 
PICARD: It's been sent to Vulcan for identification. Starfleet have
requested that we lend a hand.
