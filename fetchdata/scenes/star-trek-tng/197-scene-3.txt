(something moves in Odan's abdomen. He bathes it
with light from a device) 
(Later, after the opening credits, Beverly is brushing her hair) 
ODAN: Somehow, I had an unnatural fear that Data was going to barge in
and ask to discuss the peripheral effects of magnetospheric energy
taps. 
CRUSHER: Well if I don't get back soon and take a look at his
projections, he just might come looking for me. 
ODAN: Do you know, when I first met the formidable Doctor Beverly,
what, ten days ago? I thought to myself, this woman is ice through to
her bones. Who would have ever guessed that instead of ice, there is
fire. 
CRUSHER: Odan. 
ODAN: Stay here, don't go. 
CRUSHER: Odan, are we? Is this interfering with your work on the Peliar
Zel problems? 
ODAN: Fortunately, I've done about as much as I can until we get there.
Because I just can't seem to keep my mind on my work right now. 
CRUSHER: Odan, I have to go. 
ODAN: Promise me we'll be together tonight. 
CRUSHER: I promise. 
(he kisses the inside of her wrist) 
ODAN: Then you may go, Doctor Beverly. 
CRUSHER: It's just Beverly. 
ODAN: Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's smile, it's her kindness, her
beauty within and without. So much more than just Beverly. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Ambassador Odan. 
[Ready room]

ODAN [OC]: Yes, Captain? This is Odan. 
PICARD: The Federation representative from Peliar Zel has come on
board. Would you care to meet us in the Observation Lounge?
