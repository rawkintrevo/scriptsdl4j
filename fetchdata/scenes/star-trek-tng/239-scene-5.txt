PICARD TORAK [on viewscreen] LAFORGE
logs oh won following making empire border outpost happy

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: There are three references to a Commander
Morag, a Klingon officer who patrols this section of the border.
Apparently he would pass the station every few days and harass them. 
PICARD: Perhaps this Morag was the one who was interested in obtaining
the encrypted messages. 
LAFORGE: Could be. She didn't say. But I do have several more days of
logs left to watch. I'm hoping to learn more. 
PICARD: Very well. In the meantime, I'll speak with the Klingon
Governor about Commander Morag.

[Bridge]

TORAK [on viewscreen]: Are you saying we attacked
your outpost? 
PICARD: I'm merely saying that I'm following up on evidence that my
officers discovered on board. 
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Evidence. So you are making an accusation. The
Klingon Empire will not stand for these kinds of lies. 
PICARD: Governor Torak, I apologise. I can see that you honestly didn't
know what happened aboard the station. I will just have to take this
matter up with Gowron. I'm really sorry that we bothered you. 
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Gowron won't bother with such a minor incident. 
PICARD: Well, ordinarily he wouldn't, but of course I was his Arbiter
of Succession. I'm sure that he will be happy to come here and
investigate this matter. You needn't worry about it any longer. 
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Gowron will come here? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. So once again, thank you for your help. Oh, I will be
sure to mention your name to Gowron when I speak to him. 
TORAK [on viewscreen]: I will investigate this further, Picard. You
need not bother Gowron with this matter. 
PICARD: That's very kind. Qapla'! 
TORAK [on viewscreen]: Qapla'!
