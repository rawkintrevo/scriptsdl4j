reaction little la rate reduction changing forge emitting centimetre

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lowering wavelength in the energy system
now. 
LEAH: Reading eighteen, fifteen thirteen, eleven, eight, five, three.
Now at the two centimetre level. 
LAFORGE: Any reaction, Bridge?

[Bridge]

DATA: Negative. I detect no reduction in the life
form's rate of energy consumption. 
WORF: One minute thirty seconds to intercept.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Okay not sour enough. Leah, take it down
further. 
LEAH: Reading one, point eight, point four

[Bridge]

LEAH [OC]: Point two. 
(shudder)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I guess it noticed what we're doing.

[Bridge]

DATA: The lifeform is emitting its high frequency
transmission. Energy consumption is rising, sir. 
WORF: Captain, the creatures are accelerating their approach. They are
changing colour. 
PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Just a little more time. Leah, nudge it
down even further, toward point oh two.

[Bridge]

WORF: Thirty seconds to intercept.
LEAH [OC]: Point oh eight.

[Engineering]

LEAH: Oh five, oh three.
