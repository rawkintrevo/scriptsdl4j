PICARD: Data, can you determine for certain that
the energy source from the planet is powering this creation? 
DATA: The beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ship's
anti-matter, Captain. 
LAFORGE: I'd say they're running the manifestation off our own energy. 
PICARD: So there are limits to her power. 
RIKER: She needs the transporter to get the boy back. 
PICARD: So how do we cut the puppet's strings? 
LAFORGE: Increasing the shield harmonics to match our own antimatter
containment fields will probably sever the beam. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
RIKER: Deanna, stand by. 
TROI [OC]: Standing by.

MARLA: Jeremy, I'm not going to leave you ever again. 
TROI: I won't trick you or lie to you. 
MARLA: We'll be happy together, Jeremy, as soon as 
(Marla and the house vanish) 
JEREMY: No.

DATA: The shield has severed the beam, sir. Captain, the energy field. 
(a big green spike is rushing off the planet) 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, take us out of here. 
(But the Enterprise is penetrated by the energy field and klaxons
sound)

Security alert. Alien 
(He ducks out of the energy's way)

WORF: Security to transporter room three. 
PICARD: Commander La Forge, Mister Worf, come with me. Number One, you
have the Bridge.

(The energy has chased O'Brien out into the
corridor. There it knocks out the two security guards)
