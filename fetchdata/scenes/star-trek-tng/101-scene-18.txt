RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD MCCOY CRUSHER DATA

[Ready room]

PICARD: A fairly routine manoeuvre but you handled
it quite well. 
RIKER: Thank you, sir. I hope I showed some promise. 
PICARD: I do have some questions for you though.
RIKER: Yes, sir, I thought you might. 
PICARD: I see in your file that Captain DeSoto thinks very highly of
you. One curious thing, however, you refused to let him beam down to
Altair Three. 
RIKER: In my opinion, sir, Altair Three was too dangerous to risk
exposing the Captain. 
PICARD: I see. A Captain's rank means nothing to you. 
RIKER: Rather the reverse, sir. But a Captain's life means a great deal
to me. 
PICARD: Isn't it just possible that you don't get to be a Starfleet
Captain without knowing whether it's safe to beam down or not? Isn't it
a little presumptuous of a first officer to second guess his captain's
judgment? 
RIKER: Permission to speak candidly, sir? 
PICARD: Always. 
RIKER: Having been a first officer yourself, you know that assuming
that responsibility must by definition include the safety of the
captain. I have no problem with following any rules you lay down, short
of compromising your safety. 
PICARD: And you don't intend to back off that position? 
RIKER: No, sir, 
PICARD: One further thing. A special favour. 
RIKER: Anything, sir. 
PICARD: Using the same kind of strength you showed with Captain DeSoto,
I would appreciate it if you can keep me from making an ass of myself
with children. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: I'm not a family man, Riker, and yet, Starfleet has given me a
ship with children aboard. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: And I don't feel comfortable with children. But, since a
captain needs an image of geniality, you're to see that's what I
project. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Commander Riker. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Naturally I've heard of your case. The
visor implants you wear 
LAFORGE: Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I
quote see much of the EM spectrum ranging from simple heat and infrared
through radio waves et cetera, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said
and listened to this a thousand times before. 
(Without the Visor, Geordi La Forge's eyes are white sightless orbs,
and he has flashing red lights at his temples) 
CRUSHER: You've been blind all your life? 
LAFORGE: I was born this way. 
CRUSHER: And you've felt pain all the years that you've used this? 
LAFORGE: They say it's because I use my natural sensors in different
ways. 
CRUSHER: Well, I see two choices. The first is painkillers. 
LAFORGE: Which would affect how this works. No. Choice number two? 
CRUSHER: Exploratory surgery. Desensitise the brain areas troubling
you. 
LAFORGE: Same difference. No, thank you, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I understand. 
LAFORGE: See you. 
[Bridge]

(Riker enters) 
WORF: Yes sir? 
RIKER: Where will I find Commander Data? 
WORF: Commander Data is on special assignment, sir. He's using our
shuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the Hood. 
RIKER: An admiral? 
WORF: He's been aboard all day, sir, checking over medical layout. 
RIKER: Why a shuttlecraft? Why wouldn't he just beam over? 
WORF: I suppose he could, sir, but the Admiral's a rather remarkable
man.

[Corridor]

(A very old man in a cardigan is shuffling along.
He is played by DeForrest Kelley, so of course we name this character
-)
MCCOY: Have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over
space, boy?
DATA: No sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn't have to put
up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft. 
MCCOY: Hold it right there, boy. 
DATA: Sir? 
MCCOY: What about my age? 
DATA: Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you 
MCCOY: Troubles me? What's so damned troubling about not having died?
How old do you think I am? 
DATA: One hundred thirty seven years, Admiral, according to Starfleet
records. 
MCCOY: Explain how you remember that so exactly. 
DATA: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. 
MCCOY: I don't see any points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a
Vulcan. 
DATA: No, sir. I'm an android. 
MCCOY: Almost as bad. 
DATA: I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an
advanced and most honourable race. 
MCCOY: They are, they are. And damned annoying at times. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
MCCOY: Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. Now you
remember that, you hear. 
DATA: I will, sir. 
MCCOY: You treat her like a lady, and she'll always bring you home.
