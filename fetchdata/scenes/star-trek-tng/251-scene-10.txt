[Warbird Engineering]

TROI: Geordi, there should be a power utilisation
monitor over there. Data. 
DATA: This is highly unusual. The crew is not at battle stations. The
ship is on evacuation alert. 
TROI: Is that why Romulans were being transported to the Enterprise? 
LAFORGE: Take a look at this. There's an energy feedback returning
through the transfer beam. It's probably what overloaded the
Enterprise's engines and caused the core breach. 
DATA: Perhaps the warbird was trying to destroy the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. According to this, the Romulans were
actually trying to shut down the power transfer. 
TROI: Whatever happened, this is beginning to look less and less like a
Romulan attack. 
LAFORGE: Data, why don't we take a look at their engine readouts? 
DATA: Geordi, the engine core is completely inactive. 
TROI: That's impossible. The Romulans use an artificial quantum
singularity as their power source. Once it's activated, it can't be
shut down. 
LAFORGE: Let's take a closer look. 
(he opens the equivalent of the dilithium chamber) 
LAFORGE: I think we've found the problem. 
DATA: It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-time
continuum. Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments
we observed earlier. However, it is approximately one point two million
times as
intense. I believe this may be the origin of the temporal
fragmentation. 
TROI: What are these dark spots? 
DATA: I am not certain. They exhibit a complex bioelectric patterns.
Very possibly organic. 
LAFORGE: Organic? 
DATA: From the molecular configuration, it appears (tricorder beeps)
The aperture is beginning to fluctuate. I believe 
(there's a bright light and the Romulans start moving. One behaves very
strangely indeed) 
ROMULAN: There's an energy build-up in the phase compensation unit. 
ROMULAN 2: Check the main distribution matrix. 
ROMULAN: That's not it. The matrix is clear. It's the power transfer
from the Enterprise. I'm reading a massive feed-back. 
ROMULAN 2: Systems are beginning to overload. 
ROMULAN: Notify the Enterprise to shut down the power transfer
immediately. 
ROMULAN 2: Unable to comply. Their power interlocks won't disengage.
We'll have to disconnect it ourselves. 
ROMULAN: Disconnect the transfer beam. 
ROMULAN 3: There is no pressure. 
ROMULAN: Impending warp core breach. Shut down all systems. 
(Picard watches as the Enterprise explodes, then reforms as time runs
backwards again) 
(the dialogue goes backwards until time stops where it was previously) 
DATA: I believe my tricorder emissions caused the temporal aperture to
activate. I suggest we avoid exposing it to any
