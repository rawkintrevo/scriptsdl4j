[Bridge]

WORF: No response from the Romulan vessel. 
RIKER: Arm phasers and prepare to lock on target. 
PICARD: Did they attack the Yamato? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. 
WORF: All their weapons systems have been fully activated. Still no
response. 
PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. 
(The Romulan Bridge appears on the viewscreen. It is commanded by a
woman) 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Explain your illegal presence in the Neutral Zone. 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: Explain yours. 
PICARD: Are you responsible for the destruction of the Yamato? 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: No. But believe me, Captain, had we chosen to
exercise our right to defend the Neutral Zone, we would not have
stopped with one starship. You will leave at once. 
WORF: Mute. 
PICARD: Comments. 
TROI: She's extremely anxious. 
WORF: Understandable if she just destroyed a Federation starship. 
RIKER: Your scan was inconclusive. We don't know what happened to the
Yamato. 
TROI: Our presence in the Neutral Zone is provocative. It could force
her to respond. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: We will comply when I have determined the cause of the
destruction of the Yamato, and when I am fully satisfied that you were
not responsible. Picard out. 
WORF: They are engaging their cloaking device. 
RIKER: Good. They can't fire when they're cloaked. 
WORF: Unless they have overcome that deficiency. The Yamato was
destroyed while they were cloaked. 
PICARD: Enough. Answers. I want answers, not conjecture. Number One, I
want them at a staff meeting in one hour. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.
