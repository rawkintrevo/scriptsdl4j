LAFORGE: Hiya, Doc. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, hi. What can I do for you? 
LAFORGE: Well, I just can't seem to get any sleep. I was hoping you
could give me something. 
CRUSHER: Sit down. Let's take a look. You couldn't sleep at all? 
LAFORGE: I was restless. I kept waking up. 
CRUSHER: Would you take off your visor, please? 
LAFORGE: Sure. 
CRUSHER: Is there something on your mind? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't think so. 
CRUSHER: Well, everybody goes through these occasional bouts of
insomnia. There's probably nothing to worry about. Let's just make sure
there's nothing physically wrong. There's a minor vascular irregularity
in the visual cortex. A slight dilation of the blood vessels. It's
nothing serious. What about your visor? Has it been giving you any
problems lately? 
LAFORGE: Nothing out of the ordinary. 
CRUSHER: All the same, it might be a good idea to have it examined when
we get to Starbase thirty six next month. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
CRUSHER: In the meantime, I will get you a somnetic inducer to put by
your bed. It'll help you to sleep. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Doc. I'm sure I'll be fine.

PICARD: Energise. 
(Kell, Vagh and two other Klingons beam in) 
PICARD: Governor Vagh, thank you for coming. 
VAGH: You can thank Ambassador Kell. I am here against my better
judgment. 
KELL: Captain, I think the first thing the Governor should see is the
investigation underway in the cargo bay. 
PICARD: Of course.

RIKER: From inside the Enterprise? You're sure? 
DATA: The first and third E-band blips were clearly generated on board
the ship. The second came from the planet surface. 
RIKER: Generated by what? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. 
RIKER: Mister Data, we have a known spy on board and now we have
unexplained signals on board. I think it's reasonable to assume that
they're related somehow, wouldn't you? 
DATA: One could speculate that the E-band is being used for some form
of covert communication. 
RIKER: We need more than speculation, Mister Data. We need to know who,
what, where, when and why, or we may be going to war. 
DATA: Yes, sir. Computer, run an analysis of all known Romulan
transmission formats, all bands, Identify any commonalities with
displayed waveform. 
COMPUTER: No commonalities noted. 
DATA: Does this waveform match that of any known communication format? 
COMPUTER: Negative. 
DATA: Broaden search pattern beyond communications. Does the waveform
displayed conform to any natural phenomena, cryptographic formats or
lifeform EM emissions? 
COMPUTER: The signal corresponds to a delta compressed wavelength
spectrum similar to human neural frequencies. 
DATA: As in a human brainwave pattern? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. 
DATA: What kind of receiver would be capable of processing these
signals? 
COMPUTER: A system designed to modify the electromagnetic spectrum and
carry those messages directly to the human brain.
