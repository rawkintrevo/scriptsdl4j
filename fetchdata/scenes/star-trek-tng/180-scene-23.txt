scanner source afford couple unnecessary soon understood finished cracked

[Level 3C, 547]

LAFORGE: Damn! 
RIKER: Geordi, what is taking so long? 
LAFORGE: There's a lot of damage here. The myographic scanner is
operational, but the power source keeps fluctuating. 
RIKER: Can you fix it? 
LAFORGE: I can probably run a shunt from the convertor. 
RIKER: How long will that take? 
LAFORGE: Ten minutes? 
RIKER: Do it. O'Brien, lock onto Ishara and get her out of here!

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: There's a transformer substation directly
above the chamber she just entered. It's masking her signal.

[Level 3C, 547]

RIKER: Stand by. Stay here and cover La Forge. 
WORF: Commander! 
RIKER: That's an order. Return to the ship as soon as you're finished.
I'll signal for transport as soon as I can. 
[Tunnel]

(Ishara is hit by weapon fire. Her assailant is
bending over her when Riker shoots him. More Alliance arrive as Riker
picks her up) 
RIKER: Get us out of here.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Energising. 
(The rest of the away team are already on board) 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Come. 
(Riker enters) 
PICARD: How is she? 
RIKER: A couple of cracked ribs. She'll be all right. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher just called me with the results of the DNA
comparison. Ishara is Tasha's sister. 
RIKER: After what she did for us down there, that doesn't surprise me
one bit. 
PICARD: You took some unnecessary personal risks, Number One. 
RIKER: We lost Tasha on an away team under my command. The thought of
the same thing happening to her sister 
PICARD: That's an emotional response, Will. We can't afford it. 
RIKER: Understood, Captain. 
PICARD: Commander. Well done.
