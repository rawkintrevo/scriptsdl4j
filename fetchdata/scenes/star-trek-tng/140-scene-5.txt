WESLEY LAFORGE WORF

[Corridor]

WESLEY: Worf, did you hear about Commander Riker's
promotion? 
WORF: Yes. 
WESLEY: He didn't know his father was coming. He was completely
surprised. 
WORF: So? 
WESLEY: Can you imagine if it was your father? 
WORF: I never knew my father. 
WESLEY: And I didn't have a father long enough to know him. 
WORF: It is a waste of time to think of such things. 
WESLEY: I wasn't thinking about it, but everybody needs somebody. 
WORF: Enough!

(Hoards of Starbase Techs are swarming around
Engineering) 
LAFORGE: You know, Starbase Montgomery really didn't have to send me
all this help, because we've already checked the entire dilithium
spectrum for anomalous frequencies, so you don't have to waste your
time on that. 
(Wesley enters) 
LAFORGE: Wes. Are you okay? 
WESLEY: I was just talking to Worf. He's really eccentric at times. 
LAFORGE: That's one word for it. 
WESLEY: He was really upset. I must've said something wrong. 
LAFORGE: Maybe Worf's not too thrilled with the idea of losing
Commander Riker to a new assignment. I know I'm not. 
WESLEY: Neither am I. But with Worf it was something else. Something's
really bothering him. 
LAFORGE: Think so?
