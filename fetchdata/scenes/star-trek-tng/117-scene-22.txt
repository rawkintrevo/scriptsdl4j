LAFORGE TASHA PICARD BENSEN MANDL DATA

[Hydraulics room]

DATA: Uncertain. Geordi, please return power to the
control console in this room. I wish to reactivate the
programme. 
[Control room]

LAFORGE: You got it. 
[Hydraulics room]

(The laser powers up, turns, and fires a shot into
a tunnel cut in the wall. Then it does the same in the opposite wall) 
DATA: I am running the base drilling programme. 
(The little red light focuses on the back of Data's neck and the doors
slam shut. Data turns and dodges the deadly beams)

[Control room]

DATA [OC]: Geordi, servos off. 
BENSEN: They are off. 
LAFORGE: Data, what's happening? 
DATA [OC]: Too much to explain. 
(Benson and La Forge run to the Hydraulics room door) 
LAFORGE: Can you open that? La Forge to Enterprise. We have a problem. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Be specific. 
[Control room]

LAFORGE: Data's in the hydraulics room alone, and
we're hearing laser blasts. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Get him out of there! 
[Control room]

BENSEN: It's not working again. 
LAFORGE: We've got to get this door open. Data! We can't get in! Data!
Data! Data! 
(The door opens on a room full of smoke)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Away team, now. What is happening? 
[Hydraulics room]

PICARD [OC]: I'm going to beam him out of there. 
DATA: Bridge, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. No need to beam me up,
sir. The situation is under control. 
LAFORGE: Are you all right? 
DATA: Yes. 
LAFORGE: What happened? Did you do anything which might have set it
off? 
DATA: No, but the firing programme was dynamic. 
LAFORGE: The firing programme? In what way? 
DATA: It adjusted to my tactics. It tracked with me, anticipating. A
fixed programme
could not have done that. 
LAFORGE: Are you suggesting that someone was controlling the aiming and
firing sequence? 
DATA: That is exactly how it appeared. There was a mind working against
me. 
BENSEN: What did you do to this laser drill? A year's work destroyed! 
(The drill looks like the last turkey in the shop) 
DATA: I had no choice. 
[Ready room]

DATA: We were attempting to trace the source of the
malfunction when it attacked me. 
MANDL: How much more of this useless fantasy must I listen to? 
PICARD: None at all, Mister Mandl. Until this is sorted out, I've
provided temporary quarters for you and your staff. Perhaps you'd like
to make use of them. 
MANDL: You're overstepping your authority, Picard. You have no right to
interfere. 
PICARD: Mister Mandl, an attack on one of my crew gives me the right. 
MANDL: I have a schedule to meet. 
PICARD: Your schedule is on hold, until I have a satisfactory
explanation of this. Director Mandl. Lieutenant Yar, would you escort
the Director to his quarters. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
(Mandl and Tasha leave) 
PICARD: Go on with your report. 
DATA: It would appear the laser's drilling system was reprogrammed,
sir. As soon as its memory bank received power, it turned itself on and
went after me. Fortunately, I was able to cope with it. 
LAFORGE: And not by much, from what I saw. 
DATA: I believe it was programmed to destroy any person moving in that
room, sir. 
PICARD: Certainty? Or speculation? 
DATA: Certainty. 
LAFORGE: That would have required the talents of a master programmer. 
DATA: But it was done. 
PICARD: And so the question becomes not who, since it clearly was one
of the three remaining terraformers. The question becomes why? What are
they hiding? What could be so important that one or all of them, could
be desperate enough to kill? 
LAFORGE: Shall I have them brought in, sir? 
PICARD: Not yet.
