[Romulan Engineering]

(Geordi sticks his head inside a piece of
equipment) 
GUEST5: I'm afraid I fail to see the point of this investigation,
Commander. 
DATA: Chroniton emissions may have been responsible for the accident
which claimed the lives of our officers. 
GUEST3: A most regrettable event, of course. 
DATA: Was your cloaking device damaged in the explosion? 
GUEST5: All of our systems were damaged, including the cloaking device. 
DATA: That explains the chroniton fields I am detecting in here now.
For your own safety, it is important to eliminate those emissions. 
GUEST3: Our safety? 
DATA: There is no way to predict what will happen when the chronitons
interact with the new engine core. 
LAFORGE: I've never seen anything like this. There's something in here
that looks like a molecular phase inverter. 
RO: What's that? 
LAFORGE: It's supposed to change the structure of matter so it can pass
through normal matter and energy. Hang on a second. A few years back,
we got intelligence reports that the Klingons were working on trying to
combine a phase inverter and a cloaking
device. In theory, they believed that a phased ship could hide
anywhere, even inside a planet, and that conventional weapons would be
useless against it. 
RO: How far did they get in their research? 
LAFORGE: It never got out of the preliminary stages. There were several
accidents. The Romulans might be pursuing the same
technology, trying to combine an inverter and a cloaking device. And if
this is the prototype 
RO: Then that would explain the explosion and the chroniton fields. 
LAFORGE: And us. 
RO: You mean we're cloaked? 
LAFORGE: Not just cloaked, phased. Our entire molecular structure
altered so that we don't have any substance. 
RO: Then that would mean we're not dead. 
LAFORGE: Yes. It would also mean that there's probably a way to
de-phase us. 
DATA: The field emissions are particularly strong in this area. 
(the equipment Geordi was examining) 
GUEST5: You can be assured that the emissions will be eliminated before
the engine core is replaced. 
WORF: Commander, may I speak with you? 
(Data moves away) 
GUEST3: If they come back they're going to discover the interphase
generator. 
GUEST5: Is their power transfer beam still at full intensity? 
GUEST3: Yes. It will be until we're ready to switch to internal power. 
GUEST5: We will set up a muon feedback wave inside the transfer beam.
The particles will accumulate in their dilithium chamber. When they go
to warp speed, their engines will explode. 
LAFORGE: We've got to get to the Enterprise and warn them. 
RO: How? 
LAFORGE: I don't know, but we have to find a way. Come on. 
(A Romulan who had been sitting in a chair gets up, walks through a
console and follows them. He gets to the Enterprise on a shuttle, too)
