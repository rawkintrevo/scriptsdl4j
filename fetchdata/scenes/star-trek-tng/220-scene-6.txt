LWAXANA COMPUTER ALEXANDER

[Troi's office]

(Alexander is playing with a table monitor when
Lwaxana enters) 
LWAXANA: Ah! My little warrior. And how are you this morning? Oh, I
see. Being punished for something, are we? 
ALEXANDER: It's just my regular time to meet with Counsellor Troi.
She's not here yet. 
LWAXANA: Then you're early. That's very responsible of you. 
ALEXANDER: No, I just wanted to be out of my room before 
LWAXANA: Before what? Now, if we're to be real friends, we've got to
share only the truth. 
ALEXANDER: Why? 
LWAXANA: Well, for one thing, it's easier. When you tell the truth, you
never have to remember later what you lied about. But mostly, a true
friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying
about it. 
ALEXANDER: I wanted to leave before my father got back. 
LWAXANA: Oh. 
ALEXANDER: I hate him. I wish my mother was here. But she died. 
LWAXANA: That's not very fair, is it. 
ALEXANDER: All he cares about are rules. I'm supposed to do everything
right all the time. I don't know how. 
LWAXANA: To tell you the truth, little warrior, neither do I. But, I do
know one marvellous thing we can do with rules. 
ALEXANDER: I'm supposed to wait for Counsellor Troi. 
LWAXANA: Exactly.

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: I'll bet you've never been to a colony of
free spirits. 
ALEXANDER: What do they do there? 
LWAXANA: Whatever they want. Artists, philosophers, free thinkers and
people who don't quite fit other people's rules. Personally, I come for
the mud baths. You, oh, you're going to adore the mud baths. Computer?
I'm assuming you have the Parallax Colony of Shiralea VI? 
COMPUTER: That programme is available. 
LWAXANA: Oh, good. Then run it for us, dear.
