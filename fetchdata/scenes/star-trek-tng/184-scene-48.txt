DATA: If Counsellor Troi's supposition is correct,
a replica of the string projected behind the cluster could induce them
to reverse course, disrupting the graviton wake long enough for us to
escape. 
PICARD: How do you simulate a cosmic string? It has the gravitational
force of a hundred stars. 
DATA: I do not suggest simulating the gravitational field of the string
fragment, rather the string's vibration. 
RIKER: Vibration? We're not talking about a violin, Data. 
LAFORGE: No, Data's right. The principle is still the same. A cosmic
string emanates a characteristic set of subspace frequencies as atomic
particles decay along its event horizon. I could use the ship's
parabolic dish to amplify and reflect those frequencies back toward the
cluster. The Enterprise itself would echo the cosmic string. 
PICARD: How much time do we have, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Twenty three minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
(less than twenty three minutes later) 
DATA: Frequency-scan detectors engaged. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Receiving. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Data, we're picking up frequencies across
the entire electromagnetic and lower subspace spectrum. Trying to
isolate. Data, can you focus the reflector field for me? 
DATA [OC]: Stand by. 
[Bridge]

DATA: I am differentiating particle-emission
signatures now. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Good. Good, that's doing it. Patterns are
converging. 
[Bridge]

ALLENBY: Same course, same speed. No change, sir. 
WORF: We are beginning to encounter the gravitational effects of the
string. Impact is in four minutes. 
DATA: Sir, shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create an
accurate simulation. 
RIKER: Geordi, fire up the impulse engines. Activate the

RIKER [OC]: Ship's stabilisers. 
LAFORGE: Stabilisers on.

[Bridge]

DATA: Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts
approaching synchronisation.
WORF: Three minutes to impact. 
RIKER: Status? 
ALLENBY: The cluster is unaffected. Same course, same speed. 
PICARD: Let's try turning up the volume. Increase the intensity, Mister
Data. 
DATA: Increasing by fifty percent. 
ALLENBY: They're slowing.

LAFORGE: Graviton-wake field collapsing.
