WESLEY RIKER ENDAR LAFORGE WORF

[Bridge]

WORF: Talarian warships converging. Range, five
hundred kilometres. 
RIKER: On screen. Any communication, Lieutenant Worf? 
WORF: No, sir. We have an open channel. 
WESLEY: Commander, the warships' closing velocities are slowing.
Staggered approach vectors bearing zero, one hundred twenty, and two
hundred forty degrees. 
RIKER: Riker to La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, sir. 
RIKER: The Talarians are moving

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Into attack posture. Classic triangular
envelopment. 
LAFORGE: I've tapped the impulse engines for additional power to
shields.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: We're ready, Commander. 
WORF: Commander, the Captain of the Q'Maire requests communication. 
RIKER: Here we go. On screen. 
ENDAR [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, have you made your decision? 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker. What are your intentions, Captain
Endar? 
ENDAR [on viewscreen]: Where is Captain Picard? 
RIKER: He has been injured. I am in command now. 
ENDAR [on viewscreen]: Very well. Please prepare my son for immediate
transport. 
RIKER: I'm afraid that won't be possible. Last night, Jono attacked
Captain Picard and tried to murder him. We're holding him in custody. 
ENDAR [on viewscreen]: If he had been returned to me with the others,
this would never have happened. I hold you responsible for this
incident. 
RIKER: He will have to come with us now, Endar. It is up to Starfleet
to decide the consequences. 
ENDAR: I do not accept that decision. I repeat, you will prepare my son
for immediate transport. If he is not aboard the Q'Maire in five
minutes, you will suffer the consequences. 
(Transmission ends) 
RIKER: Red alert. 
WORF: Talarian vessels routing power to forward rockets. 
RIKER: Ready all weapons, Mister Worf.
