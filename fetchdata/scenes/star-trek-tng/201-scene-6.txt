O'BRIEN: (at tactical) The Endeavour has cleared
the dock, Captain. All ships standing by. 
PICARD: Good. Course one one eight mark three five seven, full impulse
power. Signal the fleet to get underway. We'll enter warp once we're
clear of the system. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage.

[Duras' home]

B'ETOR: The Romulan convoy is late. We need those
supplies. 
SELA: (formerly known as Woman) Gowron has suffered another loss in the
Mempa system. His forces will not threaten you in that region for some
time. 
B'ETOR: But if Gowron 
SELA: The convoy will arrive in due course. 
(Lursa enters) 
LURSA: The Federation fleet has left Starbase two thirty four. They've
set course for Klingon territory. 
MOVAR: How many? 
LURSA: At least twenty starships. 
SELA: Who's commanding this fleet? 
LURSA: Picard. 
TORAL: What does it mean? Is the Federation going to enter the war?
Should we attack them before they get here? 
SELA: Silence the child, or send him away. Movar, I want you to return
to Romulus immediately. Have all available ships
rendezvous at these coordinates in two days. 
MOVAR: Yes, Commander. 
LURSA: Twenty ships aren't enough to wage a war. Starfleet must be
bluffing. 
SELA: Perhaps.
