TROI LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD RADUE RIKER RASHELLA CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: You're limping. 
RIKER: Had a small run-in with an aspiring sprinter. 
PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: Problem, Captain? 
PICARD: No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've been
tracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It's
like following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here and
stopped, which is what I knew would interest you. 
RIKER: What's our position, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: The Epsilon Mynos system, sir. 
RIKER: Thank you, Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this for
anything. 
TASHA: What's so interesting about this system? 
RIKER: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories about
Aldea, the
wondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman of
Xerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,
peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needs
for all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to art
and culture. 
TASHA: Where is it supposed to be? 
RIKER: That's the myth. Somehow, as the legend goes, the Aldeans were
able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders, and
other hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. 
TASHA: What a wonderful fairy tale. 
DATA: Scanners still show nothing, sir. 
TROI: Scanners may show nothing, sir, but I'm sensing something very
strong. Thousands of minds. 
PICARD: From where? 
TROI: Very close. 
PICARD: All stop, and hold this position. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. All stop, and hold. 
PICARD: Anything? 
WORF: Captain, I'm recording a distortion in quadrant one, mark nine
zero. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(The stars wobble) 
PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
(Then a golden planet comes into view) 
RIKER: It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be.

Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chance
or intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out of
nowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sensors indicate that the shield is
electromagnetic, a complicated light refracting mechanism. 
PICARD: A cloaking device? 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: It's got to be pretty sophisticated to hide an entire planet .

WORF: We're being scanned, sir. 
PICARD: We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailing
frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. 
(A young woman comes on the viewscreen) 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: I am Rashella. Welcome to Aldea. 
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the USS Enterprise. We come in
peace. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We know. 
PICARD: We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I never
believed they could be true. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Our shield has confused outsiders for
millennia, Captain. 
PICARD: That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do you
reveal yourselves to us now? 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We're eager to meet in person to discuss
that, and other subjects of mutual interest. 
PICARD: We're ready anytime. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Excellent! 
(Rashella and a man appear on the deck, and seem dizzy at first) 
RADUE: We mean no harm. 
RASHELLA: Our arrival seems to have startled you. 
PICARD: It was a little sudden. 
RADUE: I'm Radue, First Appointee to Aldea. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard. 
CRUSHER: Captain, they haven't been through decontamination. 
PICARD: Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through the
regular transporting procedure. 
RASHELLA: You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is
our way, Captain. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is
operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome. 
(She hands over a bouquet) 
RADUE: And a personal invitation to a celebration on Aldea. 
PICARD: That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. 
RADUE: We will prepare for your arrival, Commander Riker. 
RIKER: How do you know 
RADUE: Your name? We've been monitoring your ship's communications. We
must return now to Aldea. Our eyes are very sensitive to bright light.
Rashella. 
(They vanish again) 
PICARD: Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and then
suddenly to be here, right in front of us. 
RIKER: Now we know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by
accident. 
PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? 
TROI: They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much,
that they're afraid we won't part with it. 
RADUE [OC]: We are ready to receive you, Commander Riker, and two of
your colleagues? 
(Riker, Troi and Crusher disappear) 
PICARD: Interesting choices.
