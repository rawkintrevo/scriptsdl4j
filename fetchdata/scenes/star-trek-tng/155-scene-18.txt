LAFORGE WORF WESLEY PICARD BOCHRA CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: To treatment. 
PICARD: You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor? 
CRUSHER: The lab is still processing the tests. Early results indicate
humans have far 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Too many bio-rejection factors. I've also
ruled out the Vulcans we've tested. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: I think I'll try a little
old-fashioned country medicine. Keep the fever down, try to let the
body heal itself. 
PICARD: Keep me advised. Picard out. 
WESLEY: Captain, the neutrino beacon is operational, and we've placed
it aboard a class three probe. 
PICARD: Well done, Ensign. Mister Worf, launch the probe. 
WORF: Aye, aye, sir. 
(Geordi is making his way along a rock face streaming with rain,
immediately above a lake) 
WORF: Probe has reached the surface, sir. 
DATA: The neutrino stream is coming in strongly. Sensors are tracking
the probe despite the interference.

[Cave mouth]

(Geordi has found shelter at last, and can see a
blue coloured vertical jet emanating
from some way away) 
LAFORGE: A stationary neutrino source. Wesley Crusher. Thank you,
Wesley. 
(So he heads off towards it, and someone comes up behind him and knocks
him out. Another Romulan. When Geordi wakes up, his own phaser is being
pointed at him) 
BOCHRA: You are my prisoner. 
LAFORGE: Right. Congratulations. Surely a strategic triumph for the
Romulan Empire. 
BOCHRA: Stay there. 
LAFORGE: My shoes are getting full of sand. I just hate that, don't
you? 
BOCHRA: Name and rank. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge. I don't think I got
yours? 
BOCHRA: A Romulan ship will arrive shortly. You will accompany me on
board. 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. You see, we heard your message too and well,
the fleet's in, Commodore. Sky's full of Federation ships. 
BOCHRA: You're lying. 
LAFORGE: I never lie when I've got sand in my shoes, Commodore. 
BOCHRA: Get up. 
LAFORGE: Seriously, the only one way out of here is for you to put that
thing down and soon as there's a window in the storm 
(There's a rock fall, and Bochra gets hit badly. Geordi helps him up
and carries him into the nearest cave)

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Are you okay? 
(Bochra has hung onto the phaser, and points it at Geordi again) 
LAFORGE: You gotta be kidding. 
BOCHRA: Sit. 
LAFORGE: Welcome to Galorndon Core, where no good deed goes unpunished.

[Crusher's office]

WORF: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, good. Come in. Please sit down. We have finally
found a compatible ribosome match for the Romulan. But only one. You. 
WORF: That is impossible. I am a Klingon. 
CRUSHER: Different species, yes. But many humanoids have comparable
cell structures. And you have what this Romulan needs. There's
absolutely no risk to you. You did understand that was the purpose of
all the testing? 
WORF: I have no objection to tests. 
CRUSHER: You have an objection to being a donor? 
WORF: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, I understand your feelings about the Romulans, but
this is not the time or place. 
WORF: If you had seen them kill your parents, you would understand,
Doctor, it is always the time and place for those feelings. 
CRUSHER: This Romulan didn't murder your parents. And you are the only
one who can save his life. 
WORF: Then he will die.
