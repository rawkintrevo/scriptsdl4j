meets consider exits strictly forgive excuse understand clearance fact

[Bridge]

(Wesley meets Picard as he exits the turbolift) 
WESLEY: Captain, excuse me. 
PICARD: Ensign. I understand you're leaving for Starbase Five One Five.

WESLEY: Yes, sir. I was just going to shuttlebay two. 
PICARD: Good. I have business there. I shall accompany you. 
WESLEY: You will? I mean, yes sir. 
PICARD: Prepare the shuttle for immediate departure. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Something I can take care of for you on Starbase Five One Five? 
PICARD: Hardly, Number One. 
RIKER: But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey. 
PICARD: I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on.

[Ready room]

(Picard is packing books for his journey) 
PICARD: Come. Yes, what is it, Number One? 
RIKER: Is something wrong? This trip to Starbase Five One Five is
rather unexpected. 
PICARD: Ensign Crusher and I will rendezvous with you on your return
from the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster. 
RIKER: Forgive my saying so, sir, but you're being rather enigmatic. 
PICARD: Consider it Captain's privilege. 
RIKER: As First Officer, I have complete security clearance. 
PICARD: This has nothing to do with ship's business, Number One.
Suffice it to say, it is strictly a matter of image.
