WESLEY BARCLAY LAFORGE DUFFY

[Cargo bay]

(Barclay is cross-legged on the floor, examining
the components of the anti-grav sled) 
LAFORGE: Hey, Reg. How, er, how's it going? 
BARCLAY: Oh, it's, er, I still haven't traced down the problem,
Commander. 
LAFORGE: That's all right. There's no problem. 
BARCLAY: I've been planning to run diagnostics on the graviton invertor
circuits. 
LAFORGE: Smart plan. I'd say we're in good hands here. 
BARCLAY: I'll see you get a preliminary report. 
LAFORGE: Whenever. 
BARCLAY: Before the end of the day. 
LAFORGE: Fine. Say, Reg, how about sitting in on the mission briefing
with my senior officers in the morning? 
BARCLAY: The briefing? Me? 
LAFORGE: I'd like your input. 
BARCLAY: What on? Do, do, do you want me to prepare a 
LAFORGE: No, no, just be there. Eight hundred hours. 
BARCLAY: I'll be on time, sir. 
LAFORGE: Good. Good. Carry on. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Morning. Start your brains, gentlemen, and
let's do it. Has anybody seen Lieutenant Barclay? 
DUFFY: Not yet, sir. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
(Barclay arrives) 
LAFORGE: Okay. This trip to Nahmi Four is pretty routine, so we'll have
plenty of time to realign the magnetic capacitors on both the matter
and anti-matter injectors. Duffy, Costa, that'll be your assignment. 
DUFFY: We probably ought to do the flow regulator maintenance at the
same time, Commander. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea. Ensign Crusher will putting in some hours
with us this week as part of his training duties, so I'll be assigning
him to assist you, Mister Myers. Be sure and teach him the difference
between impulse and warp drive, please. Lieutenant Barclay has working
on the mystery of the anti-grav failure we had yesterday. Your
preliminary report had a couple
of interesting theories, Reg. Why don't you bring us all up to speed on
your findings so far. 
BARCLAY: Yes. It wasn't a maintenance problem. Everything checked out.
I, I'm going to check for a surge in the transfer coils. 
WESLEY: A coil surge wouldn't have resulted in field dissipation. 
BARCLAY: I, I, I realise that 
LAFORGE: But we shouldn't ignore the possibilities, Wes. 
WESLEY: You ought to check the flow capacitor. A breakdown of that
could have caused a chain collapse of the antigrav fields. 
BARCLAY: I, I was going to. 
LAFORGE: Good. Okay, then let's go over the realignment procedure.
Gentlemen.
