Remmick. 
REMMICK: Sir. 
PICARD: Allow me to introduce my staff. First Officer William Riker,
Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, Chief of Security, Natasha Yar.
Well, what can we do for you? 
QUINN: I need to speak with you. 
PICARD: Certainly. This way. Number One? 
QUINN: Alone.

[Ready room]

QUINN: Commander Remmick is with the Inspector
General's office. 
PICARD: Oh? 
QUINN: He'll be conducting a full investigation of the Enterprise. 
PICARD: What are you looking for? 
QUINN: I have reason to believe there may be something very wrong on
this ship. 
PICARD: Tell me what you suspect. 
QUINN: It's inappropriate to discuss it at this time. Mister Remmick,
Starfleet is counting on you. You will find out what is wrong on this
ship. 
REMMICK: Yes, sir. Nothing and no one will stand in my way. 
QUINN: And you, Captain, are ordered to cooperate in every way
necessary with this investigation. Is that clear? 
PICARD: Yes, sir. 
QUINN: Mister Remmick, unless there are any further questions. 
REMMICK: No questions, sir. 
QUINN: Get on with your duties. 
REMMICK: Yes, sir. 
(Remmick leaves) 
PICARD: We've known one another for years. Tell me what you believe is
wrong. 
QUINN: Captain, it is vitally important that my orders be followed
exactly. I'll be staying on the ship. 
PICARD: As you wish, Admiral.
