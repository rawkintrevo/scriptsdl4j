LAFORGE BANDITO CRUSHER DATA DATAFRANK ALEXANDER

[Engineering]

(Geordi has the PADDs in pieces) 
LAFORGE: Well, the PADDs are functioning normally. It seems to be a
problem with the information retrieval net. Somehow when you tried to
call up your play, the computer accessed Data's literary files. 
DATA: Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interface
experiment. 
LAFORGE: We'd better run a level two diagnostic on the computer. See if
this problem has spread to any other systems. 
DATA: And I will perform a self-diagnostic. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea. 
CRUSHER: You will let me know if you find the play? 
LAFORGE: Oh yeah, don't worry. It's in here somewhere.

[Deadwood street]

(Alexander is coming back along the board walk with
a bag of money, when he is grabbed)


[Mine workings]

BANDITO: We got him, jefe. 
DATA-FRANK: Where's my boy? 
ALEXANDER: I'm not supposed to be kidnapped now. Computer, freeze
programme! Hey, Computer, freeze
programme. 
BANDITO: You want us to kill him, Senor Frank? 
DATA-FRANK: No. He's more valuable to us alive.


[Data's quarters]

DATA: Feline supplement one hundred twenty seven.
Spot, I have formulated a new mixture of foods specifically designed
for your highly selective tastes. 
(but Spot runs away from the bowl of food) 
DATA: I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find
acceptable. Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again. 
(Data goes to his desk, and Spot jumps on to it) 
DATA: Spot, you are disrupting my ability to work. 
(He puts Spot on the floor, but she jumps up again) 
DATA: Vamoose, you little varmint.
