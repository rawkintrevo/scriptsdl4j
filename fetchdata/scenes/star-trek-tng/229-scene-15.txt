TROI: Will. 
RIKER: We were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports.
TROI: Of course. Come in.

[Troi's quarters]

ENSIGN: Sir!
RIKER: As you were.
ENSIGN: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. I was just leaving.
TROI: If there's anything else I need, I know where to find you.

TROI: Are you bothered by his being here?
RIKER: Of course not.
TROI: Good. Because it's really none of your business.
RIKER: I know that. I believe we were with Lieutenant Fratis i n
molecular biology.
TROI: Why do I think you're upset?
RIKER: I don't know. Could we just continue with the evaluation?
TROI: Will, remember who you're talking to. You are bothered, I can
tell. 
RIKER: Deanna, I'm sorry I intruded. When you're ready to work, why
don't you give me a call. 
TROI: I will.
