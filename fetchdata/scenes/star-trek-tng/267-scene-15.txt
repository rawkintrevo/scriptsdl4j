OGAWA: You wanted to see me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Alyssa, I think you know how much I've come to depend
upon you here. I've recommended your promotion because your performance
here has been exemplary. 
OGAWA: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. 
CRUSHER: But more than that, I've come to think of you as a friend.
Someone I really care about. 
OGAWA: That's nice of you to say. I feel the same way. 
CRUSHER: So, you and Andrew Powell? 
OGAWA: Someone told you. 
CRUSHER: Told me what? 
OGAWA: We were going to keep it a secret until the promotions are
announced. 
CRUSHER: Secret? 
OGAWA: He asked me to marry him. 
CRUSHER: Alyssa, that's wonderful! I'm so relieved. I mean happy.

PICARD: Please, take a seat, Ensign. 
(then she sees the Cardassian) 
PICARD: This is Joret Dal. He was in the escape pod that we retrieved.
He is a member of the Cardassian military, and a Federation operative.
He has risked his life to bring us invaluable information about
Cardassian strategic intentions. Information that could very well
enhance the security of Bajor, as well as other planets in this sector.
Now, it is absolutely imperative that we return him safely back to
Cardassian space. 
GUEST1: It will not be easy. The border is heavily guarded. 
RIKER: As his ship was destroyed, he'll be using one of our shuttles. 
GUEST1: If a patrol stops me, I will claim to have stolen it. 
WORF: We have distressed the shuttle so that it appears to have been
fired upon. 
RIKER: Joret will attempt to talk his way past the patrol. 
GUEST1: If I were alone, the chances of my succeeding would be slim. But
if I had a prisoner with me, a Bajoran terrorist, I would appear to be
a bounty hunter. Border crossings of that nature are not uncommon, and
for a price the patrol can be convinced to look the other way. 
PICARD: Once the shuttle is safely past the patrol, Joret will put you
into an escape pod and return you back across the border. 
RIKER: Since the pod is so small, it will be difficult to detect. 
PICARD: We'll be waiting here to pick you up. 
SITO: I understand, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, this is obviously a very dangerous mission. I'm not
ordering you to take part in it. 
SITO: Then I volunteer, sir. 
WORF: Be certain you understand the risk you are taking. If you are
captured 
SITO: I'm Bajoran. No one knows better than I do what Cardassians do to
their prisoners. I've made my decision. 
PICARD: Very well, Ensign. Will you report to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
will explain. And Ensign Sito, I must ask you not to discuss this
mission with anyone. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
(Sito leaves) 
GUEST1: I didn't realise she would be so young.
