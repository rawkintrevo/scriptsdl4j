[Someone's quarters]

(Data does a fast, professional shuffle) 
RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. 
WORF: I hope so. 
DATA: Eight, Ace, Queen. The dealer receives a four. 
WORF: No bet. 
DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor. The
dealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show the
highest hand, you control the next bet. 
CRUSHER: Thank you, Data. I bet ten. Worf?
DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. 
CRUSHER: Twenty. 
RIKER: Your twenty, and fifty more. 
WORF: Fifty? 
CRUSHER: I'm in. 
DATA: I will also see the bet. Seven. A possible straight for Commander
Riker. Jack. Still no help for the Klingon. Eight. Nine for the dealer.

CRUSHER: Twenty. 
DATA: Too rich for my blood. 
RIKER: Your twenty, one hundred more. 
WORF: Fold. 
CRUSHER: Two hundred. 
RIKER: Your two, and three hundred more. 
WORF: He does not have a straight. 
CRUSHER: We'll soon find out, won't we. Let's see your cards. 
RIKER: Take it. How'd you know I was bluffing? 
CRUSHER: I just had a feeling. 
RIKER: I guess it's better to be lucky than good. 
CRUSHER: It's the way your left eyebrow raises when your bluffing. Just
kidding, Commander. 
OGAWA [OC]: Ogawa to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Go ahead. 
OGAWA [OC]: Commander La Forge needs you in Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: On my way.

[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: At first I thought the catwalk was
spinning. As it turns out, it was me. Luckily Ensign Fletcher was there
to grab me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. 
CRUSHER: You have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection. That
would explain the dizziness and the headaches. But there's no physical
evidence. My guess is you've been working too hard. 
LAFORGE: I have been putting a lot of extra hours on this Typhon
Expanse project. 
CRUSHER: I'll give you twenty cc's of vertazine. That should clear up
the dizziness. But finding time to relax is up to you. 
LAFORGE: What? What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi, have you had these symptoms before? 
LAFORGE: No. 
CRUSHER: You're sure? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm positive. Why? 
CRUSHER: It's funny. I feel like we've discussed this before, and I
remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness. 
LAFORGE: I've never had these symptoms before today, so you must be
thinking about another patient. 
CRUSHER: No. I'm sure it was you. Well, try to get some rest, and try
to stay away from high places for a few days, just in case. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Doc. 
CRUSHER: Goodnight. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight.
