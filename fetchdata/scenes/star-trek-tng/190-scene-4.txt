(Leah is getting the full tour) 
LEAH: The matter-antimatter ratio has been changed. The mixture isn't
as rich as regulations dictate. 
LAFORGE: Experience has shown me that too high a ratio diminishes
efficiency. I worked with the mixture until I got the right balance. 
LEAH: The magnetic plasma transfer to the warp field generators doesn't
correspond to the recommended specs. 
LAFORGE: Right. Again, I adjusted the flow. Sometimes things happen a
little differently here is space than they do on the drawing board. 
LEAH: Is that a criticism, Commander? 
LAFORGE: No, of course not. It's just a well known fact. There's theory
and there's application. They don't always jibe. 
LEAH: You've charted a completely new swap-out schedule for main
components replacement. 
LAFORGE: You bet. I found the Starfleet estimates for the MTBF units to
be unrealistic. I simply determined my own schedule based on
observation and experience. 
LEAH: Is that going to be your only defence, Commander, that same tired
rhetoric? Out here in the field we learn things you designers couldn't
possibly understand. 
LAFORGE: In the first place, Doctor, I'm not aware of needing any
defence. And in the second place, if you're determined to be. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Doctor Brahms, you have an incoming message on
subspace. 
LEAH: I'd like to hear this message privately. 
LAFORGE: In my office. Be my guest. 
LEAH: Thank you.

DATA: Commander, I am picking up some unusual
readings from the Alpha Omicron system. At this range, all I am able to
discern
is that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy. 
RIKER: What type of radiation signature? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. The Alpha Omicron system is yet to be charted. I
recommend we take this opportunity for further research. 
RIKER: Well, we're way ahead of schedule. Alter course for Alpha
Omicron.
