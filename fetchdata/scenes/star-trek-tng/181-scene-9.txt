[Schoolroom]

(Alexander is not playing nicely and sharing the
toys. Note, he is about half the height of Worf) 
WORF: There is no honour in attacking the weak. 
ALEXANDER: I would have won. 
WORF: No. You must earn victory. 
[Corridor]

ALEXANDER: Where are the other Klingons? 
WORF: There are no others on board. 
ALEXANDER: Why? 
WORF: The Federation and the Klingon Empire were enemies for many
years. No other Klingons have asked to serve in Starfleet. 
ALEXANDER: Why? 
WORF: A warrior does not ask so many questions. 
ALEXANDER: I don't want to be a warrior.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(Alexander runs in and gets a hug) 
K'EHLEYR: Hello! Well, you're back early. 
ALEXANDER: He made me leave. 
K'EHLEYR: Maybe you should go to your room and play. 
(Alexander runs off) 
K'EHLEYR: Is he under arrest? 
WORF: He knows nothing of our ways! 
K'EHLEYR: Our ways? You mean Klingon ways, don't you? 
WORF: He is Klingon! 
K'EHLEYR: He is also my son and I am half-human. He will find his own
ways. Why the sudden concern? You won't even acknowledge that he's
yours. 
WORF: Why did you not tell me? 
K'EHLEYR: What would you have done? That's right. You would have
insisted that we take the oath, just as tradition would demand. 
WORF: You should not have kept this from me. 
K'EHLEYR: Well, now you know. 
WORF: I cannot acknowledge my relationship to the boy. It would only
harm him. 
K'EHLEYR: Because you were dishonoured? 
WORF: As my son, he would also bear my disgrace, as would his children.

K'EHLEYR: Why did you accept discommendation from the High Council? 
WORF: My father was accused of collaborating with the Romulans at
Khitomer. 
K'EHLEYR: I know. And I also know that you challenged it. 
WORF: Yes at first. Ultimately I withdrew my challenge. 
K'EHLEYR: But why, Worf? I can't believe you'd just give up. What
really happened? 
RIKER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.

WORF: On our way, Commander.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk holding
stations at thirteen kilometres. 
PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Data. 
DATA: Channel is open, sir. Vorn responding to hail. 
PICARD: On screen. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Let's get this over with, Picard. 
PICARD: In good time, Duras. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Even in death, K'mpec makes foolish decisions.
You should not be involved in this, human. 
PICARD: The Sonchi ceremony will take place in one hour aboard K'mpec's
ship. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: One hour? What is the delay? 
PICARD: There is no delay. It is the time I have chosen. 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Exactly one hour, Picard. Do not be late. 
(Worf and K'Ehleyr enter) 
DURAS [on viewscreen]: Keep that pahtk away from the ceremony, Picard.
He has no place on a Klingon ship. 
PICARD: Picard out. 
PICARD: Contact Gowron's ship. Tell him to meet us aboard K'mpec's
vessel. Ambassador, meet me in Transporter room six in an hour. We will
begin the ceremony a little late. Mister Worf.
