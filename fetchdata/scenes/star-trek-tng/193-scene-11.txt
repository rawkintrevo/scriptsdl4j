[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Nothing. 
PICARD: Go to warp two. 
ANAYA: Aye, sir. Warp two. 
WORF: The probe is still with us, sir. 
RIKER: At warp two? 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the probe's energy output is overloading our shields.
Failure anticipated in forty seven seconds. 
PICARD: I'm willing to entertain suggestions. 
WORF: Captain, we're dropping to impulse.

[Engineering]

LARSON: (a lady engineer) Commander, warp power has
been transferred to the shield grid. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but by whom? 
(Reg wanders over and presses a control next to La Forge, then returns
to his own panel) 
LAFORGE: Barclay, what are you doing? 
BARCLAY: Lieutenant Barclay to Captain Picard. You can fire photon
torpedoes. 
[Bridge]

BARCLAY [OC]: Maximum yield, full spread. 
RIKER: We're too close. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm certain the shields will hold. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I don't know how he did it, but shield
strength has been increased by three hundred percent. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: It should be enough, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf. Photon torpedoes. Maximum yield, full spread. 
WORF: Aye. 
(three direct hits and a big light display. The ship rocks) 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Barclay.
