RIKER: If we lose antimatter containment 
PICARD: Acknowledged, La Forge. 
WESLEY: Sir, the Klingons are flanking us, attempting to draw us away

If I can't stabilise them, I'll have to dump the reactor core or she'll
blow! 
[Bridge]

DATA: Shields buckling, Captain. They will not 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I can't hold the antimatter containment
fields. Initiating emergency shutdown!

PICARD: How long until the Enterprise-C enters the
rift? 
DATA: Fifty two seconds, sir. 
PICARD: All remaining power to the defence systems. 
DATA: Power couplings severed in forward phaser banks. Attempting to
bypass. Controls not responding. 
(Riker gets killed) 
KLINGON [OC]: Federation ship Enterprise. Surrender and prepare to be
boarded. 
PICARD: That will be the day. 
(Picard jumps the rail and takes over tactical. Flames grow around him
as we cut to a shot of the Enterprise being pounded by disruptor fire
as C glides back into the rift. Then we're back on the Bridge, and
Picard is in his 'peace-time' uniform) 
PICARD: Report, Lieutenant. 
WORF: Readings fluctuated momentarily. It appeared to be a ship, but
then it vanished. 
DATA: The phenomenon is closing in on itself, Captain. 
PICARD: Very well. Prepare a class one sensor probe. We'll leave it
behind to monitor the final closure. Mister Crusher, lay in a course
for Archer Four. 
GUINAN [OC]: Captain, this is Guinan. Is everything all right up there?

PICARD: Guinan? Yes everything's fine. Is something wrong?
