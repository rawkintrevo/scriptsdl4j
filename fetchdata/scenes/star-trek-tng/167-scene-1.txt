(Scantily clad holiday makers stroll to and fro, as
two aliens beam in and go to the information desk) 
COMPUTER: Welcome to Risa. All that is ours is yours. 
AJUR: (the female alien) We are looking for the lodging chamber of
Captain Jean-Luc Picard. 
COMPUTER: A file scan reveals no record of a Captain Picard currently
visiting Risa. 
AJUR: When is he expected to arrive? 
COMPUTER: Where is no arrival date on file for any such individual. 
BORATUS: (the male alien) Could we have been mistaken? 
AJUR: He will come.

First officer's log, Stardate 43745.2. We have
departed Gemaris Five, where for the past two weeks Captain Picard has
been serving as mediator in a trade dispute between the Gemarians and
their nearest neighbour, the Dachlyds.

RIKER: Welcome back, Deanna. 
TROI: It's good to be back. The last two weeks have been gruelling. 
RIKER: I take it the Captain was able to negotiate an agreement
mutually beneficial to both parties. 
TROI: He was. I don't know how he managed it. The Gemarians and the
Dachlyds are both incredibly stubborn people. 
RIKER: The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Go to warp four, Mister Bennett. Set a course for Starbase
twelve. Report. 
RIKER: Everything status quo, sir. 
PICARD: Very well. If anyone needs me, I'll be in my Ready Room. 
RIKER: Sir. Congratulations. 
PICARD: About what? 
PIKER: About the trade agreement. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: Is it my imagination, or is something bothering the Captain? 
TROI: He has been under a great deal of strain lately. While we were on
Gemaris, he ate sparingly and slept even less. 
RIKER: Anything we can do? 
TROI: Actually, I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree to
it. 
RIKER: What would that be? 
TROI: Our captain needs a vacation.
