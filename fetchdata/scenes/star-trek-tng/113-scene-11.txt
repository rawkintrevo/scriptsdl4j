[Bridge]

RIKER: Status report. 
TASHA: We're being probed, sir. 
TROI: The Jarada. 
TASHA: Most likely, but it's long range. Can't be certain where it's
originating.
(The ship shakes as a beam passes through it, including the holodeck,
whose controls flicker and door briefly opens and closes a few times) 
RIKER: One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us. 
LAFORGE: Commander, I'm receiving a subspace message from the Jarada. 
RIKER: That's not part of the plan. Pipe it through. 
JARADAN [OC]: En-ter-prise. We speak to you in your language. The time
has come to honour us in ours. 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker, First Officer of the Enterprise. 
JARADAN [OC]: You are not captain? 
RIKER: No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screen
communication so we can see each other 
JARADAN [OC]: You offend us! We will not show ourselves to a mere
subordinate. We await your Captain's greeting with growing unrest. End
of communication. 
RIKER: Terrific. Find the Captain. He's in the Holodeck. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
[Outside Holodeck]

seams) 
COMPUTER: Enter when ready. When ready. When ready. 
(It takes a couple of goes to get the doors open enough to go through)
