[Jefferies tube]

(Red alert sounds) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to La Forge. Status? 
LAFORGE: Ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
LAFORGE: Acknowledged. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Commander? 
LAFORGE: What? 
BARCLAY [OC]: You're too late.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, we have not regained control of the
propulsion systems. The ODN bypass to the Bridge has been blocked. 
RIKER: Barclay! 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, Commander Riker? 
[Holodeck]

RIKER [OC]: Whatever it is you're doing out there,
you've got to stop it. 
[Bridge]

(there's a red sparkling swirly thing on the
viewscreen) 
WORF: Sir, we're going in. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, respond at once! 
(nothing, so Picard gestures to Worf) 
WORF: Audio's disconnected. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, take a security team to holodeck three. Disconnect
Mister Barclay from the computer. 
WORF: Aye, Captain.

[Holodeck]

(Worf and two security men march in. One approaches
Barclay and is repelled by a forcefield) 
BARCLAY [OC]: I want you to know, Lieutenant Worf, that I understand
your duty in this matter. 
WORF: Phasers. Maximum setting. 
BARCLAY [OC]: And that I in no way will take your actions personally. 
WORF: Conduits. 
(no effect, then the Enterprise is stretched in to the red and swirly
thing, with internal wormhole effects)
