BARCLAY [OC]: Hello, Deanna. 
TROI: Reg. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry that we can't take that walk in the Arboretum. 
TROI: So am I. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn't
your intent. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Young children are sometimes frightened of the world.
That doesn't mean that their parents should let them stay in their
cribs. 
TROI: Are we children to you now? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can see so much more than you are capable of. You
should trust that. Deanna, I've always wanted to earn your respect. 
TROI: You've got it. From all of us. We don't need any more convincing.
Please, obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: You must trust me. 
TROI: How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Trust me. 
TROI: The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. 
(and the lasers speed up even more)

you've got to stop it.

WORF: Sir, we're going in.

WORF: Audio's disconnected. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, take a security team to holodeck three. Disconnect
Mister Barclay from the computer. 
WORF: Aye, Captain.
