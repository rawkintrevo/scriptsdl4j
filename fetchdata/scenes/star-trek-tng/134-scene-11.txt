KLAG RIKER TACTICS KARGAN

[Pagh corridor]

(Riker is being escorted along a gloomy corridor) 
RIKER: Is something wrong? 
TACTICS: No. It's just I have never seen anyone of your species before 
RIKER: I'm just an average, everyday human who happens to be a
Commander. Now, what were your orders? 
TACTICS: To escort you to the Captain. 
RIKER: Proceed. 
TACTICS: Yes, Commander. 
[Pagh Bridge]

(The Bridge is also dimly lit with red light.
Support struts form obstacles) 
RIKER: Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. 
KARGAN: That is incorrect. 
RIKER: I don't understand. 
KARGAN: You are Commander William Riker, First Officer of the Klingon
cruiser, the Pagh. Or do you intend to disobey Federation orders? 
RIKER: I have no such intention, sir. 
KARGAN: Exactly where are your loyalties, Commander? 
RIKER: I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. 
KARGAN: This ship is equipped with our best weapons and our finest
warriors. Although we are on a peaceful mission, we are ready to go
into battle instantly. I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in
this crew to serve and die in that battle. So I ask you again,
Commander Riker. Where are your loyalties? 
RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders.
And I will do exactly that. 
KARGAN: Will you take an oath to that effect? 
RIKER: I just did. 
KLAG: (in Klingon) Do not believe him! He lies! 
KARGAN: (in Klingon) Speak in their language. This is your Second
Officer, Lieutenant Klag. 
RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? 
KLAG: Yes sir. I do not believe you. 
RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. 
KLAG: Correct. 
RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? 
KARGAN: I would say it your first command decision. 
(Riker looks around and thumps Klag in the stomach before throwing him
on the floor, then kicking him down before he can get up again, and
finally ramming his head into a computer panel. Lots of sparks. Kargan
laughs)
RIKER: My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern
is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner
to that of Lieutenant? 
KLAG: I will take your orders. 
KARGAN: And you, Commander Riker, will obey my orders. 
RIKER: Of course, Captain Kargan.
