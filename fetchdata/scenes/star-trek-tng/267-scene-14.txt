PICARD [OC]: Doctor Crusher, are you ready? 
CRUSHER: Stand by. Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to
leave now. 
OGAWA: All right, Doctor. 
(Alyssa leaves) 
CRUSHER: Transporter room. go ahead. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

(Sito is standing guard) 
OGAWA: What are you doing here? 
SITO: I'm not supposed to let anyone but the senior officers inside
Sickbay. 
OGAWA: Do you have any idea what's going on? 
SITO: No, do you? 
OGAWA: I'd better go. 
(Alyssa leaves as Picard arrives) 
PICARD: Ensign. 
SITO: Sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Twelve hundred hours. Alpha shift is
relieved. 
LAVELLE: Excuse me, sir. If you don't mind, I'd like to stay on for
another shift. I could use the training. 
RIKER: Now's not the best time. 
LAVELLE: Yes, sir.

[Outside Sickbay]

PICARD: Ensign, you're with me.

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Bridge. You are a certified pilot, Ensign? 
SITO: Yes, sir.

[Ready room]

PICARD: How long have you served on board the
Enterprise, Ensign? 
SITO: Seven months, sir. 
PICARD: I see I understand that you've been recommended for the Ops
position. Do you think you're up to it? 
SITO: I do, sir. 
PICARD: I'm not so sure. I'm concerned about your record. 
SITO: Sir? 
PICARD:  The incident that you were
involved in at the Academy. 
SITO: With all due respect that was three years ago. My record since
then 
PICARD: It doesn't matter how long ago it was, Ensign. Would you do
something like that again? 
SITO: I can assure you, sir, that I would never, never jeopardise lives
by participating in 
PICARD: A dare devil stunt? I would certainly hope not. What concerns
me is that you participated in a
cover-up that impeded an official investigation into the death of a
cadet. 
SITO: Sir, I know I should have told the truth right from the start 
PICARD: Yes you should, but you didn't. Instead you joined with the
others to pretended that was simply an accident. Now, what do you think
that tells me about your character? 
SITO: Sir, if you had any idea what it was like after that incident. I
didn't have any friends. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I had to take
my flight test with the instructor because no one else would be my
partner. In a lot of ways it would have been easier to just walk away,
but I didn't. I stuck with it. Doesn't that say something about my
character, too? 
PICARD: Well I'm really very sorry you didn't enjoy your time at the
Academy, Ensign. As far as I'm concerned, you should have been expelled
for what you did. Quite frankly, I don't know how you made it on board
this ship. You're dismissed.
