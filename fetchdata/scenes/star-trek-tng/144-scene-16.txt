[Riker's quarters]

BRENNA: William Riker, you're a mess. 
(She starts picking things up) 
RIKER: You don't have to do that. 
BRENNA: And if I don't, who will? 
RIKER: I can see why your father wants to marry you off. 
BRENNA: Oh, and why is that? 
RIKER: So he can have a pipe and mug of beer in peace. 
BRENNA: You've shown me so many wonders on your great ship, but there's
still one thing you haven't shown me. 
RIKER: What's that? 
BRENNA: I'm still waiting to wash my feet. 
RIKER: Right behind that door. 
BRENNA: William, is something wrong? 
RIKER: What do you mean? 
BRENNA: Do you not like girls? 
RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? 
BRENNA: You generally start at the top and work your way down. 
RIKER: I think I can handle that. 
(He lets down her hair and kisses her) 
BRENNA: I was hoping you might.

[Cargo hold]

WORF: You sent for me? 
DANILO: Ah, yes, yes. Now, we're brewing poteen, but we need to find a
way to heat it without this bloody ship firing bloody lightning bolts
at us. 
WORF: You can obtain spirituous liquours from the food dispensers. 
DANILO: Oh, no, no, no. It's not that synthehol bilge that O'Brien
offered me, is it? 
WORF: No, if you wish, it can be real alcohol. 
DANILO: Good. 
WORF: With all of the deleterious effects intact. 
DANILO: As it should be. You see, lad, every moment of pleasure in life
has to be purchased by an equal moment of pain. Whiskey. 
(a glass appears, and Danilo samples it) 
DANILO: Terrible. It's got no bite. 
WORF: Chech'tluth. 
(A Klingon mug, with steam coming off it. The top Danilo's head does a
somersault) 
DANILO: Now that's what I call a wee drop of the creature. 
BRENNA: Father! 
DANILO: Remember what I said about the moment of pain? Well, tis about
to begin. Hello, my darling. 
BRENNA: Oh, my darling, is it? I might have known! Are you drunk yet,
or can you talk with Doctor Pulaski about the children? 
DANILO: What about them? 
BRENNA: She wants to send them to school with the ship's children. 
DANILO: What do you think? 
BRENNA: I think it's a good idea. So go handle it! (to the other men)
I'm sure there's something you can be doing with your time. (to Worf)
And as for you. 
WORF: What? 
BRENNA: Why did you have to tell them that this magic wall can give
them more than meat and potatoes? Now we'll never get a lick of work
out of them. 
WORF: Madam, have you considered a career in security? 
BRENNA: If it's anything like babysitting, I'm an authority. 
(The women laugh) 
Captain's log, supplemental. We are approaching the
class M planet where we hope to find the other colonists. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Signal from the planet, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. This is Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise,
representing the United Federation of Planets. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: This is wonderful. Welcome, Captain. I'm
Wilson Granger, Prime Minister of Mariposa. 
DATA: No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Not quite a descendant. We feared Earth had
suffered some catastrophe when no one came back to check on us. 
PICARD: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. But
despite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager to
renew ties. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Splendid. Please, come down, and allow us to
extend our hospitality to you and your crew. 
PICARD: Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. 
TROI: I would urge caution. 
RIKER: Caution? What's wrong? 
TROI: He's hiding something. 
RIKER: We'll check it out. Mister Worf. Doctor Pulaski, join us in
Transporter room three for an away detail.
