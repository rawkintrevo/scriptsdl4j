(Crusher appears from where she was hiding) 
CRUSHER: Permission to report to the captain 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Captain. Sir, my son is not on the Bridge. He merely
accompanied me on the turbolift. 
PICARD: Your son? 
CRUSHER: His name's Wesley. You last saw him years ago when 
PICARD: Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a
look around? 
(Wesley steps onto the Bridge) 
PICARD: But don't touch anything! Try it out. (the captain's chair) The
panel on your right is for log entries, library computer access and
retrieval, viewscreen control, intercoms, and so on. Here we have 
WESLEY: And here, the backup conn and ops panels, plus shield and
armoury controls.

(Crusher and Wesley step back into the turbolift) 
PICARD: Picard. Go ahead. 
SECURITY [OC]: Ship's sensors have detected the presence of a vessel
approaching this planet. No ship is scheduled to arrive at this time,
sir. 
PICARD: Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could
that be the Hood returning here? 
SECURITY [OC]: The vessel does not match the Hood's configuration or ID
signal. 
PICARD: Put it on main viewer. Identification? 
WORF: Vessel unknown, configuration unknown, sir. 
(It looks like a classic flying saucer) 
PICARD: Hail it. 
WORF: We've been trying, sir. No response. 
PICARD: Raise all shields, phasers at ready. 
WORF: Shields up, sir. Phasers ready. 
PICARD: Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all
frequencies.

PICARD [OC]: Do you know who it is? 
ZORN: There are no ships scheduled to arrive until 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. You
mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: But we have had no dealings with them. It was
only a, a thought. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Are you certain? 
ZORN [OC]: I promise you, Captain. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: We were making an empty threat. I wanted your
cooperation. Forgive me. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir. 
SECURITY: (at Tasha's station) It measures twelve times our volume,
Captain. 
(A purple light envelopes the Enterprise) 
WORF: Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.
