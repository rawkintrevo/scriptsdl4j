[Engineering]

KOPF: Our velocity is holding steady at warp nine
point three. Do you wish to override, Commander? 
LAFORGE: No, not yet. Computer, isolate cause of life support failure. 
COMPUTER: Atmosphere conditioning pumps on deck one are operating in
negative mode. 
LAFORGE: How could that be? There are seven independent safety
interlocks to prevent that. 
(Picard and Worf enter, then others) 
LAFORGE: Captain, I believe we've found the problem, but it really
doesn't make sense. 
PICARD: Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Full stop, Ensign. 
KOPF: It's not responding, sir. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to have to do this at the manual input level, sir.
Wes. 
RIKER: We're still at the altered heading, Captain, holding at warp
nine point three. 
WORF: Captain. Force fields have been established on all main Bridge
turbolift doors and service crawlways. 
PICARD: Computer, locate Lieutenant Commander Data. 
COMPUTER: Commander Data is on the main Bridge. 
RIKER: What the hell is he up to? 
PICARD: Number One, take a security team up to deck two. Try and break
through from below. Commander? 
LAFORGE: Everything's locked up, Captain. We have no control of impulse
or warp engines from here. 
WESLEY: Navigation's not responding either, sir. 
PICARD: Picard to main bridge. 
[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Commander Data, do you hear me? I
repeat. Data, do you hear 
(Data cuts off the comm.) 
DATA: Computer. Recognise Data, Lieutenant Commander. Alpha One
clearance. 
COMPUTER: Priority clearance recognition Alpha One. 
DATA: Maintain minimum auxiliary power and disengage subspace
communications. 
COMPUTER: Acknowledged.

WESLEY: He is on the Bridge, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare for saucer separation. 
WESLEY: Sir, we're at Warp nine three. 
PICARD: I am aware of the risks, Ensign. When the umbilical splits, we
should regain primary control, do you agree? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: The saucer module should fall out of warp in two minutes. Be
prepared to sweep back. Pull it in with a tractor beam. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Initiate auto sequence.
