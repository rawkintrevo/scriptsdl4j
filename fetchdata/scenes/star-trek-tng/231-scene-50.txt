aliens)

DATA: Tetryon emissions continue to increase. The
rupture is still expanding. 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: Hull breach is imminent. 
LAFORGE: They're reacting faster than we can shift frequencies.
Shipley, programme
the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression. I want to channel all
of the graviton energy into a single burst. Let's see if they can
handle that. 
SHIPLEY: Ready, Commander.

panel)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: The rupture is beginning to close, sir. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Recharge the emitters. Let's hit them
again. Come on. 
SHIPLEY: Ready.

(Riker sneaks over to Rager, and uses a phaser to
stun an alien)

[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: The rupture is eighty six percent
closed. 
LAFORGE: We're almost there. One more burst should do it. 
SHIPLEY: Emitters recharging.

rupture into)

(the rupture turns into a blue streak which whizzes
around then flies out into space)

Captain's log, stardate 46191.2. The tetryon
emissions in cargo bay four have ceased, and there have been no further
indications of alien intrusions. All Enterprise crewmembers are safe
and accounted for. But we are still left with some unanswered
questions.
