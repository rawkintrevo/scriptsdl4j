[Doctor's office]

GUEST2: Our anniversary is next week. Our fiftieth. 
CRUSHER: In his heart, he's still the same man you married, Anne. 
TROI: That's true. He still cares for you, despite the physical changes
he's undergoing. 
GUEST2: But he's getting younger, and I'm, well look at me. Why did he do
this? 
TROI: Because there are lives at stake, Mrs. Jameson. 
GUEST2: What about our lives, his and mine? I was looking forward to time
together finally. Our retirement. Now he's young again, and has his
life to live over. 
TROI: Doctor, she has to know. 
GUEST2: Know what? 
CRUSHER: Anne, your husband. 
GUEST2: What is it? 
CRUSHER: He's not stabilising. He may not have that life to live over.

[Observation lounge]

(It's dark, so we can assume that Jameson is even
younger than last time. Picard enters) 
JAMESON: We'll be at Mordan in three hours. 
PICARD: I couldn't sleep either. 
JAMESON: I never could before a mission. I always wound up in the
observation lounge, staring out at the stars, thinking. 
PICARD: Perhaps in this case, rethinking? 
(Jameson turns so we can see the brown-haired, smooth-skinned twenty
something he has become) 
PICARD: Why is this mission so important to you? Why did you risk your
life to lead it personally? 
JAMESON: I want to save lives, Captain. 
PICARD: Noble sentiments, but that's too easy an answer. You've been
here before. You negotiated a release of the hostages with Karnas
before. Why is it now your answer is an armed raid? It's my away team
you're sending in there. I think there's something you're not telling
me, and I have a right to know what it is. 
JAMESON: Do you know the background? The Mordanites had some
sophistication, but were still ruled by tribal family units. Karnas's
father was the ruling chief of one of the families. Another tribe had
him assassinated. Karnas seized the passengers of a starliner and held
them hostage, demanding that Starfleet provide him with weapons that
would enable him to defeat his rivals. 
PICARD: That's the official record. 
JAMESON: Officially, the story is that after two other mediators were
murdered, I went in and negotiated with Karnas to bring out the
hostages safely. 
PICARD: Are you saying that's not the truth? 
JAMESON: It wasn't my golden oratory that saved them, Captain. I gave
Karnas the weapons he wanted. 
PICARD: You did what? 
JAMESON: I gave exactly the same weapons to his rivals. My
interpretation of the Prime Directive. Let them solve their problems
with those arms on an equal basis. 
PICARD: And that decision plunged them into forty years of civil war. 
JAMESON: I didn't know that would happen. I thought a minor war. It
would be settled in less than a year. How would I know it would take
four decades? But I falsified the reports to Starfleet, and I lived
with that on my soul, Picard. Sixty-three people came away safe but
millions died on Mordan because I delivered those weapons. 
PICARD: Karnas could have worked for peace during those years instead
of continuing the war. It's not all on your head, Admiral. 
JAMESON: But I started it. I lit the match. Now finally I can vindicate
myself, if only in a small way. I came to negotiate, but that isn't
what Karnas wants. 
PICARD: Revenge. That's why he demanded you when he knew that you were
still alive. 
JAMESON: And I'm not going to give it to him, Picard. I'm going to do
what I should have done the first time. We're taking the hostages out
by force, if necessary. No deals.
