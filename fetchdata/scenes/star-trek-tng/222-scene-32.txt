(and into the arboretum for a good cry) 
ISABELLA: Clara. 
CLARA: Why were you being so mean to me? Why'd you do that to my
friend? 
ISABELLA: Because you ran away from me. You left me alone. I had to do
everything by myself. 
CLARA: You're scaring me. 
ISABELLA: I was going to protect you, Clara. I liked you. But now I
don't care. Now, when the others come, you can die along with everyone
else.

PICARD: Status, Mister Data. 
DATA: At our current speed, we will clear the nebula in twelve minutes
four seconds. 
PICARD: Continue a full sensor sweep. I want all the information we can
gather. 
(ship shudder) 
WORF: Captain, forward velocity is down by point six percent. (shudder)
Velocity down by two point four percent. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: We are moving through a dense concentration of energy strands. 
RIKER: Can we go to warp? 
LAFORGE: The stress on the hull would be too great. 
DATA: Captain, density appears to be lower off the starboard bow. 
PICARD: Ensign, bring us to bearing oh three oh mark five. 
FELTON: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Forward velocity holding. 
PICARD: Steady as she goes.

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: Is something wrong with the cake? 
TROI: Excuse me? 
GUINAN: Well, I see you sitting here with a piece of untouched
chocolate cake in front of you. I assume something's wrong with the
cake or something's bothering you. 
TROI: I'm sure the cake is fine. I've just been thinking. 
GUINAN: Let me guess. About the little girl with the imaginary friend? 
TROI: I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing. 
GUINAN: How so? 
TROI: Well, I know the best thing to do is to gradually wean her away
from her fantasy, and she did make some new friends today and had a
good time. 
GUINAN: But? 
TROI: But I can't help feeling that I'm taking something from her.
Something precious. A part of her childhood she'll never have again. 
GUINAN: Well, I'm not sure about that. I was just telling Clara about
my imaginary friend. 
TROI: You have an imaginary friend? 
GUINAN: A Tarkassian razor beast. It protected me. I knew as long as
that razorbeast was around, nothing could hurt me. You know, over the
years his body kind of faded away but the idea stayed. And I just don't
seem to talk to him as often as I used to. 
TROI: You still talk to it? 
GUINAN: Oh, yeah, when I'm afraid or I get confused or a little scared.
I just don't think you should have to give up an imaginary friend. 
SUTTER [OC]: Ensign Sutter to Counsellor Troi. 
TROI: Go ahead, Ensign. 
[Sutter quarters]

SUTTER: Would you come to my quarters? I'm having a
problem with Clara. 
[Ten Forward]

TROI: I'm on my way.

[Sutter quarters]

SUTTER: She won't even go into her room. She's
terrified that Isabella's going to hurt her. 
TROI: Clara, your father tells me Isabella has been saying some very
bad things to you. What did she say? 
CLARA: She said they were going to come and kill everyone. 
TROI: Who's going to come and kill everyone? 
CLARA: The others, like her. 
TROI: Did she say why? I know you're very frightened. Sometimes what we
imagine can be just as scary as something real. But I promise you,
there is no way Isabella can harm you or anyone on this ship. 
CLARA: But she's not imaginary anymore. She's real now. I can see her. 
TROI: You can see her? 
CLARA: Yes. 
TROI: If I go with you and hold your hand, will you go into your room? 
CLARA: I think so. 
TROI: We'll make sure Isabella isn't anywhere around, okay? Come on.
