[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: That's not true. 
PICARD: Let me talk to him. Number One, I think we have an opportunity
to end this siege. 
[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: It will require the cooperation of all
concerned. 
[Ten Forward]

PICARD: Our guests will be moving shortly to cargo
bay four, where the transport will occur. I want you to ensure them of
safe passage between Ten Forward to the cargo bay. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Understood, Captain. Doctor. Mister La
Forge. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: Transporter controls are being
transferred. Ten Forward to Bridge. I said all transporter controls.
Including those aboard all your shuttlecraft.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try. Ten
Forward. Our mistake. Remaining transporter functions are being
transferred to you.

[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: Once we create our own access code, we can
prevent anyone using the transporter against us. We can go to the cargo
bay. 
DATA: What about the weapons? 
TROI: We will each take a hostage for protection. 
DATA: Klingon. 
TROI: Picard, you are mine. 
KEIKO: Please, let her stay. 
(Miles lets Keiko hand Molly over to the woman again) 
TROI: Lower the forcefield.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Security teams, stand by. 
RO: They're heading through section five.

group get into a turbolift)
