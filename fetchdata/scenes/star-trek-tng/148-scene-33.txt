[Angel One - Beata's quarters]

BEATA: You resist. Don't you find me attractive? 
RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. 
BEATA: You attract me like no man ever has. 
RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of
another world. 
BEATA: It's not the reason. 
RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? 
BEATA: I hope so. 
[Up The Long Ladder - Riker's
quarters]

BRENNA: William, is something wrong? 
RIKER: What do you mean? 
BRENNA: Do you not like girls? 
RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? 
BRENNA: You generally start at the top and work your way down. 
RIKER: I think I can handle that. 
BRENNA: I was hoping you might.

[Sickbay]

PULASKI: The organisms responded all right. Their
growth rate has doubled. 
TROI: Then all we've done is made things worse. 
PULASKI: Now we know the organism's growth rate is related to the
memories he's experiencing. 
TROI: Or the emotions that they produce. 
PULASKI: Different mental processes generate different chemicals.
Perhaps the organisms are sensitive to brain endorphins. 
TROI: Then if some types of endorphins attract them 
PULASKI: Others will repel them. I'm going to change the differential
current pattern and see what happens.

[Skin of Evil]

TASHA: We're not going without our shuttle crew. 
ARMUS: I warn you. 
TASHA: Enough! We have people who need attention. We won't hurt you,
but we must help them. 
(Armus lets lose a bolt of energy which sends Tasha flying a long way.
Riker and Data's phasers have no effect on Armus)
PICARD [OC]: Number One! 
RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. 
DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. 
RIKER: We had no effect on it. 
(Armus sinks back into the slick) 
PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! 
CRUSHER: She's dead.

[The Child - Troi's quarters]

PULASKI: I'm losing life signs. 
TROI: You must save him. 
PULASKI: I'm sorry. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Growth rate has definitely slowed. What is
he feeling? Can you tell? 
TROI: Sadness. 
PULASKI: Which is the opposite of before, and it's having the opposite
effect on the infection. 
TROI: Then your theory's correct. The organisms are sensitive to
different types of endorphins. 
PULASKI: And negative emotions 
TROI: Such as sadness 
PULASKI: Produce endorphins that inhibit the organisms' growth. 
TROI: Then we've found a way to repel the infection. 
PULASKI: Assuming we're not too late already. 
TROI: How much time do we have? 
PULASKI: I'm not sure. His vital signs are getting weaker. I don't want
to risk another dose of tricordrazine unless I have to. I must refocus
the pattern again. We need to isolate memories that generate stronger
negative emotions.
