seven right thank things make yearning report alright room

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Security. Lieutenant La Forge just left
Sickbay while I was in my office. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: He doesn't have his communicator. It
is very important that we find him. 
TASHA: Security team alert, pick up Lieutenant La Forge. He just left
Sickbay moments ago. Captain, anything further? 
PICARD: Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. 
[Crusher's quarters]

(Geordi is with Wesley, who is showing off his
latest device by floating a chair around the room) 
WESLEY: It's a model of the same kind of tractor beam our ship uses
with a few ideas of my own added. 
LAFORGE: So that's your science project, huh? Wes, you're really
something. 
WESLEY: And since the Captain won't let me on the Bridge, I use this to
imagine I'm there. 
PICARD [OC]: Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirty
seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. 
LAFORGE: It's the Captain's voice. 
WESLEY: It's pieced together from words he's used on the intercom. With
this, I can pretend he's ordering me to take the Enterprise anywhere.
And listen to this, 
PICARD [OC]: Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,
report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: What do you think? 
LAFORGE: I think the Captain's lucky you're on his side. 
WESLEY: But he still won't let me on the Bridge. And there's nothing
there I don't understand. 
LAFORGE: I wish I understood myself that well. 
WESLEY: Are you okay? 
LAFORGE: No, Suddenly I seem to be burning up inside. It's hot in here.

[Observation lounge]

(Geordi is staring out at the stars) 
TASHA: Geordi? Geordi? Lieutenant Yar in the Observation lounge. Send a
team here now. Medical's been worried about you. 
LAFORGE: Help me. Help me to not to give in to the wild things coming
into my mind, 
TASHA: Geordi, my job is security, 
LAFORGE: Tasha, please. 
TASHA: Alright. Alright, helping is more important. Geordi, how can I
help you? 
LAFORGE: Help me to see. Like you do. 
TASHA: But you already see better than I can. 
LAFORGE: I see more. But more isn't better. 
(He takes off his Visor) 
TASHA: Geordi, please put 
LAFORGE: I want to see in shallow, dim, beautiful human ways. 
(He strokes her face) 
TASHA: We'll talk about it, Geordi. Right now I'm going to take you to
Sickbay. All right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
TASHA: Okay. Good. 
[Sickbay]

TASHA: And then we got him down to Sickbay so
Doctor Crusher could examine him. 
PICARD: He wasn't violent? 
TASHA: No, sir. He was very upset. He kept talking about wanting normal
vision. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant.
(Tasha wipes her forehead and leaves. She's feeling warm) 
CRUSHER: According to our medical readouts, there's still nothing wrong
with him. He looks like he's running a temperature but every instrument
we have says he's not. 
PICARD: Doctor, every person on that ship over there died. Is there any
chance that whatever did it is loose on my ship? 
CRUSHER: If you mean a disease, sir, I'd say there's no chance of it.
We used full decontamination, we examined every team member very
carefully, 
PICARD: The entire crew somehow managed to kill themselves, Doctor. If
it's not a disease, what else could have made them do that? 
CRUSHER: The obvious alternatives would be in areas of insanity and
severe emotional upset. Troi, do you feel anything unusual in the
lieutenant? 
PICARD: Security just told me that he was longing for normal eyesight.
That's a sudden yearning for that. 
TROI: Since his records show no previous mention of that, the fact that
it's happened now could be important. But all I sense from him is
confusion. If I didn't know better, I'd say he was intoxicated. 
CRUSHER: Our tests would have shown that. Also any other signs of
drugs, hallucinogens or other contaminants.
