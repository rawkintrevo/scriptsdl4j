SERGEY ROBERT HELENA WORF PICARD

[Worf's quarters]

WORF: Enter. 
SERGEY: Are we disturbing you? 
WORF: No. No. I thought you were going to your quarters to sleep. 
HELENA: We just came by to tuck you in. 
WORF: Please. When I heard you were on the visitors' list, I was not
sure I wanted you to come. I am glad you are here. 
HELENA: We had to come. 
SERGEY: Our boy was in trouble. After we read your letter about the
discommendation from the Klingons. 
HELENA: We don't exactly understand it all. 
SERGEY: We don't have to. We know what kind of man you are. 
HELENA: Whatever you did, we know it was for a good reason. 
WORF: I must bear my dishonour alone. 
SERGEY: That is not true. 
HELENA: I'm sorry if this is too human of us but, whenever you are
suffering, you must remember we are with you. 
SERGEY: And that we're proud of you, and that we love you. 
HELENA: You're our son.

[Chez Picard]

(Picard is making inroads into a bottle of the
family produce when Robert comes in with flowers for the house) 
ROBERT: Careful. You're not used to drinking the real thing. This
synthehol never leaves you out of control, is that so? 
PICARD: That's so. 
ROBERT: This will. (pours himself the last dregs) Now there is
something I'd like to see. 
PICARD: What's that? 
ROBERT: The gallant Captain out of control. Mind if I ask you a
question? What the devil happened to you up there? 
PICARD: Is this brotherly concern? 
ROBERT: No. Curiosity. What did they do to you? 
PICARD: You know what happened. 
ROBERT: Not precisely. I gather you were hurt. Humiliated. I always
thought you needed a little humiliation. Or was it humility? Either
would do. (Jean-Luc storms out of the house)
