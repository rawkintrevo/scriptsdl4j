[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
WESLEY: Sorry to bother you, sir. 
PICARD: It's no bother, Wesley. Please, sit down. 
WESLEY: Thanks. 
PICARD: How are the survey preparations coming along? 
WESLEY: They're coming along fine, but that's not what I'm here to talk
to you about. 
PICARD: What then? 
WESLEY: There's a game going around. It's something that Commander
Riker brought back from Risa. It's a device that hooks around the ears.

PICARD: Yes, I've seen it. 
WESLEY: I did some preliminary tests on the game, and what I found
leads me to believe that it may have some harmful side-effects.
Specifically, sir, I think it's psychotropically addictive. 
PICARD: Addictive? What have you discovered? 
WESLEY: The game initiates a serotonin cascade in the frontal lobe of
the brain. Now I know that's nothing conclusive, but it could explain
why everyone is so attracted to it. And at the same time, it stimulates
the brain's reasoning centre. I don't know what that's all about. 
PICARD: I'll start an investigation immediately. Thank you, Mister
Crusher. 
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Wesley? It's good to have you back again. 
(Wesley leaves, and Picard picks up his headset for a game or three)

[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: Have you tried this? 
ROBIN: I've tried it, thanks. It's great. 
WESLEY: Robin. 
ROBIN: Where have you been? Everyone's after me to try it. 
WESLEY: I know. I got stopped in the corridor twice. I talked to the
Captain. He's going to look into it. 
ROBIN: I hope he makes a shipwide announcement or something, because
this thing is really starting to give me the creeps. 
WOMAN: Did you forget your games? 
ROBIN: We left them in our quarters. 
WOMAN: Well then, use mine. 
ROBIN: No, thanks. 
WOMAN: Try it. 
WESLEY: She said no thanks. 
(they get up and walk away) 
WESLEY: You know what else is really weird? If this game is so
addictive, there's only one person onboard we can be sure wouldn't be
affected by it. 
ROBIN: Data. 
WESLEY: Right. And he managed to get injured right when the game was
brought on board. We'd better take a look at him.
