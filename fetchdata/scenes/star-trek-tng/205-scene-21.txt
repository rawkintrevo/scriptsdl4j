TROI RO CRUSHER LAFORGE OBRIEN

[Cargo bay]

CRUSHER: Once the air is vented, the first thing
you'll feel is extreme pressure in your lungs. You have to resist the
temptation to exhale. Next, our hands and feet will get cold, then
numb, and some of the capillaries on exposed sections of the skin may
burst. 
LAFORGE: Sounds like fun. 
CRUSHER: We will have about fifteen seconds of useful consciousness,
then about ten seconds of extreme disorientation, then we pass out. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Once the air is evacuated, one of us is going to need to
get to that panel to repressurise the bay. 
(of course, the panel is on the far wall) 
LAFORGE: We're ready. Are you okay? 
(one touch of a button, up goes the outer door, some hyperventilating,
another command and out goes the air, the barrels and the green fire.
Geordi closes the doors and they set off across the bay, but he
collapses halfway. Beverly just makes it and air rushes back in)

[Bridge]

RO: The field strength is down to twenty percent.
We cannot run the risk of staying here any longer. 
O'BRIEN: We're in no danger until it drops below fifteen percent. We
can afford to wait and see if anyone in Engineering notices those
monitors. 
TROI: Have you made preparations to separate the Saucer section? 
RO: Yes, sir. We're in stand by mode for docking latches. 
O'BRIEN: Ensign there's a thermal inversion in the power coupling! 
RO: Quick, cross-connect to the transfer coil. That was close. 
TROI: What happened? 
RO: Exactly what I said might happen. The power coupling overheated and
the entire containment field almost collapsed.
O'Brien's fixed it temporarily, but this could happen again at any
moment, and next time we might not be able to stop it. You
can't let wishful thinking guide your decision, Counsellor. It's time
to leave. 
TROI: We will separate the ship when I decide that it's time, and not
before. Is that clear, Ensign? 
RO: Yes. Perfectly.
