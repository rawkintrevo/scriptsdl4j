RIKER IAN PICARD TROI PULASKI DATA

[Bridge]

PULASKI: Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor. Welcome to the Bridge. Please, sit down. How is
Counsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? 
PULASKI: I've delivered dozens of babies, but none like this. There was
no pain, no trauma. 
RIKER: It's true. 
PULASKI: It was effortless for both of them. 
PICARD: I'm not sure of your point. 
PULASKI: She had her baby yesterday. If I were to examine her now, I
would not be able to tell she had a baby, or had ever had a baby. It
was as if the incident never happened. 
PICARD: Data, how long before we begin the transfer? 
DATA: Two hours nineteen minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paid
my respects.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. 
PICARD: Deanna, I wanted to see how you were and have a look at your
baby! My goodness. How old is he? 
(The boy is walking, and about waist height to Troi) 
PULASKI: In actuality, a day. 
PICARD: Yes, but 
PULASKI: In appearance, almost four earth years old. 
TROI: Ian, say hello to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: You mean he can talk? 
IAN: Hello. 
(Pulaski shudders) 
PICARD: Hello, Ian. 
IAN: Please don't worry. Everything is okay.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are faced with two
major problems. Troi's child and the deadly cargo we are about to take
on. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued his rapid
growth and now appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of
eight. Still there is no indication as to who he is, or why he is here.

RIKER: Sickbay, this is the Bridge. We are ready to
begin loading. 
PULASKI [OC]: We need a little more time. It's taking longer than we
anticipated to categorise these specimens.

[Pulaski's office]

PULASKI: Da(h)ta, look at this. 
DATA: Data. 
PULASKI: What? 
DATA: My name. It is pronounced Data. 
PULASKI: Oh? 
DATA: You called me Da(h)ta. 
PULASKI: What's the difference? 
DATA: One is my name. The other is not. 
PULASKI: Is this possible? With all of your neural nets, algorithms,
and heuristics, is there some combination makes up a circuit for
bruised feelings? Possible? (returns to the monitor) I am unfamiliar
with this symbol. 
DATA: It indicates a genetically engineered biological life form. 
PULASKI: About twenty percent of the specimens fall into that category.
Some eager beaver at play. 
DATA: Query. Eager beaver? 
PULASKI: Well in this case, eager beaver refers to some overachieving
genetic engineer, who, probably because of lack of anything better to
do, has forced this strain of virus to mutate, just so we can see how
bad, bad can get. Captain Picard.

PICARD: Picard. 
PULASKI [OC]: I just wanted you to know what risks we're about to take.

PICARD: Go on.

PULASKI: If the most innocuous specimen on the
manifest list gets loose,
