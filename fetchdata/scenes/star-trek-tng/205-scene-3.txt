TROI: Captain, I'd like to introduce you to the
winners of the primary school science fair. This is Marissa, Jay
Gordon, and Patterson. They're here for their tour. 
PICARD: Hello. 
PATTERSON: Can we see the battle bridge and torpedo bay? 
PICARD: No, I'm afraid not. But we will be visiting the hydroponics and
astrophysics laboratories. 
TROI: I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. 
PICARD: Well. If you'll come with me. 
(Picard and children go into the turbolift as O'Brien comes out) 
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure who to feel sorry for, the Captain or the kids.

PICARD: I want you to know we're very proud of the
science fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a
career in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your science
projects? 
PATTERSON: I planted radishes in this special dirt and they came up all
weird! 
PICARD: I see. That's very, very commendable. And you? 
JAY GORDON: An analysis of the life span of the swarming moths of Gonal
Four. They only live for twenty hours, then they all die. 
PICARD: How interesting. And you 
(but before the shy girl can answer, something happens)
PICARD: We're falling!
