[Troi's office]

RIKER: I didn't want to leave without saying
good-bye. 
TROI: I don't like good-byes. How about, until next time? 
RIKER: How about until next time. 
TROI: It's been a pleasure serving with you, Commander. 
RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. 
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels but, I can't read you
right now. 
RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. 
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. 
RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. 
TROI: Are you feeling sad? 
RIKER: Yes, I am. 
TROI: So am I.

KYLE: We can clear the air once and for all. 
RIKER: You're on.
