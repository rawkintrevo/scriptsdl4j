PICARD:
Where are my
weapons?
GUEST3: Unavailable, sir! We cannot disengage the modified beams. The
connections have been fused. 
KOLRAMI: We must retreat! 
PICARD: Unacceptable! 
DATA: The Ferengi have broken off their attack. Drop shields. Transport
the away team aboard. 
GUEST3: Transporter functions gone, sir. 
DATA: Shields reduced to one fifth intensity. 
KOLRAMI: Use their moment of indecision to escape! 
PICARD: I have forty crewmembers on board the Hathaway. 
KOLRAMI: Who should be sacrificed to save a thousand! Acceptable
tactical losses, considering the circumstances. 
PICARD: Not to me! Notify Starfleet. Priority. Hail the Ferengi on my
command. Formulate alternatives. 
KOLRAMI: As the Starfleet observer I am ordering you to withdraw! 
PICARD: I am the Captain of this vessel! Your order is nullified!
Ferengi on main viewscreen. 
(The familiar sight of Armin Shimmerman in Ferengi makeup greets us) 
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, of the Federation Starship, USS
Enterprise. Why have you attacked my vessel? 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: Why was your ship combative with another
Federation vessel of lesser design? Why do you now protect your former
target? What is its value to you? 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Our probes indicate you were aware of our
approach, yet took no action. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: Your answers will dictate our response. 
PICARD: We have refrained from launching a counter-attack in the hope
that this can be resolved this peacefully. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: Our probes indicate that you are crippled, and
the ship you protect has no weaponry, no light speed drive, and only a
scarce crew. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: This makes no sense to us. Unless it
contains something very valuable. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: I am Bractor, leader of the Ferengi attack
vessel Kreechta. I shall have the secret of the other Federation ship.
Surrender it to me, and I will allow your Enterprise to leave unharmed.
You have ten of your minutes. 
GUEST3: Sir, they're massing a surge of power. We're being scanned.
They've locked on. 
PICARD: Data? 
DATA: Our shields will not withstand another assault. 
KOLRAMI: Then there are no options. Retreat or die.


Captain's
log, supplemental. Due
to a miscalculation on my part, Enterprise
has been subjected a
surprise attack by the Ferengi. I
find myself with little time
to decide the fate of forty of
my crew stranded aboard the
derelict Hathaway.

PICARD:
I am open to
suggestions.
GUEST3: Captain, we are now capable of launching a limited number of
photon torpedoes. 
KOLRAMI: I've already given you my advice, Captain. The Hathaway is
expendable. 
GUEST3: Commander Riker is hailing, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. Number One, have you been monitoring communications?

RIKER [on viewscreen]: And Kolrami's right. You've got to save the
Enterprise. 
PICARD: That would leave you defenceless. 
RIKER: When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive and take our
chances. 
PICARD: Your what? 
RIKER: We have a limited, two-second warp capability. 
KOLRAMI: Impossible! That ship was rendered warp inactive. 
PICARD: I told you he was the best. I'd like to hear about this, Number
One, later. Right now I have to work something out with Mister Data.
