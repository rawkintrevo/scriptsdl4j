WESLEY: Ensign Davies? 
DAVIES: You got him. 
WESLEY: Wesley Crusher. I've been put in charge of the planetary
geological surveys, and I'd like to have you on the team. 
DAVIES: Sounds great. Who else is on it? 
WESLEY: I have Prixus and Alans and Hildebrandt. 
DAVIES: It's a shame you didn't talk to me first. It's just personal
opinion, but I like to break up married teams. 
WESLEY: I hadn't thought of that. 
DAVIES: Don't worry, they'll probably work out fine. And if you need
any help, just give me a signal and I'll take over for you. We don't
want you to get too beat up on your first command. 
WESLEY: Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I'll be all right.

with intent, and a PADD) 
PULASKI: Wes? 
WESLEY: Hi, Doctor Pulaski. 
PULASKI: You have trouble behind that door? 
WESLEY: My team's in there. I've got to assign planets, set a schedule.

PULASKI: It sounds like you've got everything under control. 
WESLEY: I haven't had to deal with them yet. Not together, not
professionally. 
PULASKI: Wes, the minute you walk through that door they're your team.
You have nothing to prove. You've got the authority. 
WESLEY: That's just 'cos Commander Riker says I do. 
PULASKI: It's up to you to hang on to it. Now, you'd better get in
there, and Wes, for whatever it's worth, I think you're going to do
just fine. 
Captain's log, stardate 42737.3. It has been six
weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema sector. Each system
has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet.

HILDEBRANDT: (the woman on the team) It seems to be
at this point we can expect the greatest tectonic stresses. 
WESLEY: I agree. Nice job. 
DAVIES: Here are the results of my scan on the third Selcundi system.
It's just the same old song. 
WESLEY: Didn't you tell me that UV absorptions like these are
indicative of traker deposits? 
DAVIES: And where there's traker there's generally dilithium? Yes, I
did. 
WESLEY: So don't you think we ought to run an ico-spectrogram? 
DAVIES: Well, Wes, these traker readings are really faint. It's
probably just a fool's echo. 
WESLEY: I think I'd still run an ico-gram. 
HILDEBRANDT: Wesley, it's a major undertaking to set up the scanner. 
DAVIES: We're looking at five hours minimum. 
WESLEY: I know, I know. I don't want to do a half way job. 
DAVIES: Wes, there's being thorough and then there's wasting time. It's
also the mark of a good officer to recognise the difference. 
WESLEY: Maybe you're right.
