PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

  [Ten
forward]

(The band is assembling and tuning up. O'Brien is
on cello, a Vulcan on violin) 
DATA: Captain. Doctor. I am honoured by your presence, but may I
suggest you attend the second concert. 
CRUSHER: Why, Data? 
DATA: Ensign Ortiz will perform the violin part. My rendition will be
less enjoyable. 
PICARD: Oh? 
DATA: Although I am technically proficient, according to my fellow
performers, I lack soul. 
CRUSHER: Data, telling us why you're going to fail before you make the
attempt is never wise. 
DATA: But is not honesty always the preferred choice? 
PICARD: Excessive honesty can be disastrous, particularly in a
commander. 
DATA: Indeed? 
PICARD: Knowing your limitations is one thing. Advertising them to a
crew can damage your credibility as a leader. 
DATA: Because you will lose their confidence? 
CRUSHER: And you may begin to believe in those limitations yourself. 
(The quartet begin Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik) 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we're receiving a message from the Sheliak
Corporate. 
(Picard's departure puts Data off his performance)
