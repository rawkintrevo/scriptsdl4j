[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: I've been studying the autopsy reports. The conclusion is
appalling. There was no outside source, no alien presence. All thirty
four of them appear to have killed each other. 
PICARD: What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison? 
CRUSHER: Toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their
systems, and they all appear to be in good health. But for whatever
reason, they seemed to turn against each other, using phasers and
knives and bare hands. I'd like you to see this, Captain. It's from the
logs of the Brittain. Captain Zaheva's mental condition deteriorated
steadily once they'd became stranded. She began talking of plots and
mutinies. This was the last entry log, made after they had been adrift
for over three weeks. 
ZAHEVA [on monitor]: First Officer Brink and his men were behind it.
They got to the engines. They don't work anymore. Had to eliminate
Brink. the ship is out of, out of, we're running out. Too dangerous!
Out of Brink! And his men!

[Nightmare]

(Deanna is walking through a green fog, then she
starts flying. Ahead are two lights, one large, one smaller) 
VOICE: Eyes in the dark. One moon. 
TROI: Where are you? I'm coming. Where are you? 
VOICE: Eyes in the dark. One moon. Eyes in the dark. One moon circles.
See the eyes in the dark. One moon. 
TROI: Where are you? 
(then she wakes up, gasping for air)

Captain's log, stardate 44635.8. Four days have
passed, but we have made little progress in solving the mystery of the
Brittain. I have decided we should return to Starbase two twenty, and
to that end, Commander La Forge is rigging the Brittain for towing.
