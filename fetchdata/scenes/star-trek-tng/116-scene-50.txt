PICARD: Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do you
read me? 
[Starbase Command Centre]

QUINTEROS: This is Starbase 74. Captain Picard,
what is your situation? 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We'll go into that later. Right now I must
speak to Lieutenant Commander Data. 
DATA [OC]: I am here, sir. 
PICARD: Data, the Bynars have stored an enormous amount of material in
our computer. We need to access it. We can't. 
[Starbase Command Centre]

DATA: The access would be available by code or
password. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Yes, I know that, Data, but what could it
be? 
[Starbase Command Centre]

DATA: File names can be anything, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: They want us to find it. They would have
kept it simple. 
[Starbase Command Centre]

DATA: Then a name, or a place. It could be
something personal. In this case, in binary language, which is ones and
zeros in groups of eight or sixteen characters. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: (pointing at the pile of Bynars) Would they
have kept it that
simple? Try it. Picard out. 
(The computer searches the combinations of 1 and 0 to get to 11001001) 
RIKER: That's the file. It'll work now. 
PICARD: Now access the file. Start the transfer. 
(Access denied) 
RIKER: So much for that idea. 
PICARD: Let me get on the other position. The Bynars always work in
pairs. Maybe that is also required. It appears to be successful. Their
system's started up. A resident diagnostic programme is running. Their
system is absolutely incredible. 
(The Bynars wake up, get up and access the nearest console) 
ZERO ONE: Our world 
ONE ZERO: is reactivated. 
ZERO ONE: Our people 
ONE ZERO: express their gratitude. 
ZERO ZERO: We will return to 
ONE ONE: your starbase for whatever 
ZERO ZERO: punishment your system 
ONE ONE: requires of us. 
PICARD: Why didn't you just ask for our help? 
(They discuss it amongst themselves) 
ZERO ONE: You might have 
ONE ZERO: said no. 
RIKER: But there was a very good chance we would have said yes. 
ZERO ZERO: Our need was too great 
ONE ONE: to risk rejection. 
PICARD: So you stole it. 
RIKER: Their reason is part of their binary thinking. For them there
are only two choices.
One or zero. Yes or no. Why did you lure me to the holodeck and hold me
there. 
ONE ZERO: Because we knew we might die. 
ZERO ONE: And we needed someone 
ONE ZERO: to restore our computer. 
ZERO ONE: And you did. 
PICARD: No one has been hurt. You have achieved your objective. You
have your planet back in order. We have our ship. Well, it's been some
time since I had the conn. But not to worry, Number One, you're in good
hands. Starbase 74, warp two. Engage. Everything's under control.
