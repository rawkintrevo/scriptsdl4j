[Bridge]

PICARD: Enterprise to away team, come in. 
LAFORGE: We're receiving no signal at all from them, sir. 
PICARD: Transporter room. lock on to the landing party. Beam them up. 
LAFORGE: We've got nothing to lock on to, sir. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We've entered the
structure. Riker to Enterprise, come in. Come in, Enterprise. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: When they went through that antique
doorway, the signal just disappeared, sir.
PICARD: What's causing the interference? 
LAFORGE: Unknown. 
PICARD: Are they receiving us? 
LAFORGE: No. We're going to have to recalibrate all the frequencies to
find one that'll work. 
PICARD: Then do it.

[Lobby]

DATA: Sir, without communication, we should beam up
immediately. 
RIKER: We're here, there's no danger. We'll look around then leave. 
BELLBOY: Checking in, gentlemen? You'll have to go to the front desk. 
RIKER: Very good. We'll start with that. 
CLERK: Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice trip? 
RIKER: Do you know us? 
CLERK: We've been expecting you. A trio of foreign gentlemen. 
RIKER: Yes. We're from the United Federation of Planets. 
CLERK: Of course you are. Welcome to the Hotel Royale 
BELLBOY: Excuse me. Did Rita call? 
CLERK: I'm busy. 
BELLBOY: You're busy? This is my life I'm talking about here. Now did
Rita call or not? 
CLERK: No, and for your own good you'd better quit thinking about Rita.

BELLBOY: I'm not afraid of Mickey D. 
CLERK: Then you're a fool. Anybody with any sense is afraid of Mickey
D. 
BELLBOY: If Rita calls, you let me know. 
(Bellboy leaves) 
CLERK: Kid's just asking for trouble. Rita's too much for him to
handle, and Mickey D's going to plant
his face in the pavement. Now, here are your room keys. And some
complimentary casino chips. Enjoy. 
WORF: What is this place? How did a being like you get here? 
CLERK: Why, this is the Royale, of course. And my personal life is
really none of your business, thank you. 
RIKER: What he means is, what planet is this? 
CLERK: I beg your pardon? 
RIKER: This planet. What do you call it? 
CLERK: Earth. What do you call it? 
WORF: We call it Theta Eight. 
CLERK: How charming. 
(The manager returns to putting mail into pigeon holes, so the team
take a stroll amongst the tables) 
DATA: Commander 
RIKER: Yes, Data? 
DATA: None of these people are emitting life signs. 
WORF: You mean they're not alive? 
RIKER: Then what are they? 
WORF: These beings, are they machines, or mere illusions designed to
deceive us? 
DATA: Not illusion, Lieutenant. They do exist, but they do not register
as either man or machine. 
DATA: Take this creature, for example. He does not exhibit any DNA
structure. 
TEXAS: Excuse me, son. Look who's talking. Man, you sound just like my
ex-wife. All right. Time to get back to business! 
DATA: What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to?

PICARD: Status report. 
WESLEY: We're attempting to employ alternate encoding schemes. 
LAFORGE: There could be hundreds of possible combinations. 
PICARD: Is there an intelligence causing this interference? 
LAFORGE: That's impossible to tell, Captain. 
PICARD: It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When he
lost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediately
to the beam down coordinates. 
TROI: I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose one
word to assess his mood, it would be amused. 
PICARD: Amused? 
[Casino]

(Good ol' Tex is settling himself at a blackjack
table, next to a blonde lady. Data goes up to the table) 
TEXAS: Put some chips there, mister. Yes, sirree! You're new around
here, aren't you? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
TEXAS: Sit down. I'm going to teach you how this game is played, boy.
Go ahead. Ante up. 
(Tex puts his Stetson on Data, and Data sits the other side of him) 
VANESSA: He wants you to cut the cards. 
DATA: Ah, is this poker? 
TEXAS: No, no, blackjack. 
DATA: Blackjack. Accessing. Ah. Also known as twenty one, a number
which defines the object of the game. Picture cards are worth ten, aces
one or eleven, all other cards face value. 
TEXAS: Boy, you're right. You are right. 
(Data does a one-handed cut of the pack, and Vanessa whistles at his
skill) 
TEXAS: Pretty smooth. Run 'em, boy. Make 'em nice and friendly. 
VANESSA: Twenty one, twenty one. 
TEXAS: Don't look at your hand, honey. That gal has got to win. Now,
honey, you got fifteen and the dealer's showing ten. 
VANESSA: Do I hit, Texas, or do I stand? 
TEXAS: If you've got to win, you've got to hit. 
VANESSA: Hit me. (a king) Damn! 
TEXAS: Shoot. Hit me. Twenty one, and a winner. Yes, sirree. 
DATA: Hit me. Another please. 
TEXAS: Do you think you've had about enough? 
DATA: If the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty one
points, I will definitely need another card. 
VANESSA: Yeah. 
TEXAS: Boy, you have got the brass. Do you know what the odds are on a
five card charlie? Hell, you're just throwing your money away. 
DATA: Hit me. 
(Even with the final nine, the two twos and the two threes keep him
from going bust) 
TEXAS: How'd you? Shut my mouth. Hey, you're not one of them card
counting fellas, are you? 
DATA: The number of the cards and their values remain quite constant.
What would be the purpose in counting them? 
VANESSA: Yeah. 
RIKER: Having fun, Data? 
DATA: Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved,
I am mainly conducting research into 
RIKER: Save it. We're getting out of here. 
DATA: Understood, sir. 
TEXAS: Guys, you're holding up the game. 
RIKER: Our apologies, sir. 
TEXAS: I'll watch your chips. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. 
TEXAS: Hey. The hat. 
DATA: Sorry, sir. 
TEXAS: Deal them up.

PICARD: Progress? 
WESLEY: We've accessed the range of encoding scheme alternates. The
difficulty is in the frequency range. The interference is highly
variable. 
LAFORGE: See, the problem may be with the envelope covering the
structure. There are hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. 
PICARD: Any transmissions are simply scattered and refracted at random.
No wonder you can't get through. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. 
PICARD: Those are some fairly aggressive computations, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: I'm comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against
our phasers. 
PICARD: Is penetration possible? 
LAFORGE: I don't know just yet. It may be an option. I'd like to run
this test. 
PICARD: Make it so.
