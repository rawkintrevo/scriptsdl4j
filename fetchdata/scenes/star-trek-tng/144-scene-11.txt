[Hallway]

GUEST0 2: Doctor, is your title scientific or
medical? 
PULASKI: Medical. 
GUEST0 2: Ah, excellent. 
PULASKI: Is there some medical problem we should know about? 
GUEST0 2: I think it best if the, er 
PULASKI: Prime minister explains that. Somehow I thought you might. 
GUEST0 2: Yes. Excuse me. Gentlemen? Please, follow me. 
(Pulaski runs a secret scan on another man as Worf and Riker catch up
with them) 
GUEST0 2: This way please. Doctor. 
[Granger's office]

GUEST0: Welcome to Mariposa. 
PULASKI: Doctor Katherine Pulaski. 
GUEST0: This is my Chief of Staff, Elizabeth Vallis. 
PULASKI: Tell me, is your entire population made up of clones, Prime
Minister? 
WORF: Clones? 
RIKER: Clones? 
GUEST0: Clones.

Captain's log, supplemental. Prime Minister Granger
has requested an urgent meeting to discuss the future of the Mariposan
colony. I've invited him to the Enterprise. 
[Observation lounge]

GUEST0: Captain, we need your help. Three hundred
years ago during our landing on Mariposa, the skin of our ship was
breached. Only five of the colonists survived. The progenitors weren't
willing to just give up and die, and they were scientists 
PICARD: So, they used that expertise and turned to cloning. 
GUEST0: Yes. We had no other option. Two women and three men
represented an insufficient gene pool from which to build a society. 
PULASKI: How did you suppress the natural sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive
laws? 
GUEST0: In the beginning, a little bit of each. Now, after three
hundred years, the entire concept of sexual reproduction is a little
repugnant to us. 
PULASKI: How did you overcome the problem of replicative fading? 
GUEST0: We haven't. 
PULASKI: You have got a problem. 
RIKER: Wait. I don't understand replicative fading. 
PULASKI: Each time you clone, you're making a copy of a copy. Subtle
errors creep into the chromosomes, and
eventually you end up with a non-viable clone. 
PICARD: How can we help you? 
GUEST0: We need an infusion of fresh DNA. I was hoping that you would
be willing to share some tissue samples. 
RIKER: You want to clone us? 
GUEST0: Yes. 
RIKER: No way, not me. 
GUEST0: How can you possibly be harmed? 
RIKER: It's not a question of harm. One William Riker is unique,
perhaps even special. But a hundred of him, a thousand of him
diminishes me in ways I can't even imagine. 
GUEST0: You would be preserving yourself. 
RIKER: Human beings have other ways of doing that. We have children. 
PICARD: I think you will find that attitude prevalent among all the
Enterprise people. 
GUEST0: I see. Well, if you are not willing to share your DNA, will
you at least send some people to repair our malfunctioning equipment? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Number One, put a technical team together.
Let's get these repairs underway. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. Lieutenant La Forge. Prepare a technical support away
team. Meet me in transporter room three. 
(Riker leaves) 
PULASKI: Captain, with your permission, I would like to return to the
planet. It could be my last opportunity to study replicative fading.
With your permission, of course, Mister Prime Minister. 
GUEST0: You'd be most welcome. Perhaps you will find a solution that
we have overlooked. 
PULASKI: Well, I appreciate the compliment, but I don't think that's
very likely. And repairing that equipment will certainly not solve your
problems. 
GUEST0: What other solution do we have? Doctor, remember, there are
only five of us. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker and
Doctor Pulaski have returned to Mariposa with a team of Enterprise
technicians.
