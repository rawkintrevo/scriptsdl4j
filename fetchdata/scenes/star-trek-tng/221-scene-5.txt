[Turbolift]

PICARD: Deck seven. Picard to Worf. 
WORF [OC]: Worf here, Captain. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, one of the Ferengi just waylaid Ambassador Briam. I
need you to keep them on a tight leash.

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: I don't want them disrupting this
conference. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Security to cargo bay one. 
RIKER: Lieutenant? 
WORF: One of the Ferengi. 
RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. 
[Cargo bay]

(Qol is on his perch, scanning the glowing egg when
Worf and his team enter) 
WORF: What are you doing? 
(Qol looses his balance and falls, knocking a small barrel into the
'legs' of the egg. It falls in extreme slow motion and the golden glow
dissipates) 
GUEST5: This is a misunderstanding. I was looking for a barbershop.
Apparently I made an incorrect turn and 
(Picard, Briam and Riker enter) 
PICARD: Mister Worf? 
RIKER: Get him out of here. Confine them both to their quarters. Put a
guard on their door. 
(Worf, Qol and security leave) 
PICARD: What is happening? 
GUEST2: Emergence. 
(the egg finally vanishes and a beautiful woman remains. She stands up
gracefully, smiles and walks straight to Picard) 
KAMALA: I am for you, Alrik of Valt. 
GUEST2: No, Kamala. This is not Alrik. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Federation Starship Enterprise. 
KAMALA: That explains why you don't look at all like your holographs. I
apologise, Captain. As an empath, I could sense your authority. I
assumed you were Chancellor Alrik. 
PICARD: I'm afraid I require an explanation, Ambassador. 
KAMALA: As do I, Ambassador. Why have I been brought out of stasis
prematurely? 
GUEST2: It was an accident. This is quite complicated. Perhaps you and I

KAMALA: It is not complicated at all, Briam, and the Captain has no
tolerance for prevarication. I'm a gift, to Alrik of Valt. 
RIKER: You mean you're using this ship to transport a sentient being as
property? 
GUEST2: Not as property, as a gift, and I was concerned that you might
not entirely understand. 
PICARD: Your concern was justified, Ambassador. 
KAMALA: You're angry. Why? 
PICARD: There is a provision in the Federation Constitution that
protects an individual's fundamental rights. Now once you were brought
aboard this ship 
KAMALA: You're coming to my rescue. What a kind and generous purpose.
But Captain, I do not need to be rescued. 
GUEST2: Kamala is the key to peace between our two worlds. 
RIKER: Why? 
KAMALA: In our history there's a woman known as Garuth, who was loved
by the brothers Krios and Valt with such passion that an empire fell. 
GUEST2: And the wars began when Krios kidnapped Garuth and took her to
our planet. 
KAMALA: Like her, I'm an empathic metamorph. The first female metamorph
born in my world for over a hundred years. 
PICARD: A metamorph? 
KAMALA: A mutant. A biological curiosity, if you will. With the ability
to sense what a potential mate wants, what he needs, what gives him the
greatest pleasure and then to become that for him. 
RIKER: You mean you change according to whatever man you're with? 
KAMALA: Until I reach the stage of bonding, when I must imprint upon
myself the requirements of one man, to serve as his perfect partner in
life. 
GUEST2: You see, male metamorphs are somewhat common, but females are
born only once in seven generations. So obviously they are greatly
sought after as mates. 
RIKER: Which explains the Ferengi's interest. 
GUEST2: This mating to Alrik was arranged sine her birth by the leaders
of both worlds, in the hopes of restoring peace. 
PICARD: You do this of your own accord? 
KAMALA: It is my sole purpose in life. 
PICARD: Commander Riker, escort her to quarters. There's no need for
you to travel in the cargo bay. 
GUEST2: Kamala, remain in your room. I will speak to you shortly.
