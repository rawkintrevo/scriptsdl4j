[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I don't think the holodeck's going to last
that long. We've had materialisation errors and resolution failures all
over the place, and it's getting worse. The simulation could fall apart
any minute. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We'll have the transporter room standing
by. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready or
not. Please keep Mister Worf apprised. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problem
to worry about. 
[Vorin's quarters]

VORIN: Yes. 
PICARD: We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have you
made a decision? 
VORIN: I believe I would like to go back to my people. 
PICARD: I see. What do you intend to tell them? 
VORIN: I don't know. 
PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believe
you? 
VORIN: I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story. 
PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or
that you're insane. 
VORIN: I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know
and being regarded as a madman. 
PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They
would learn about alien worlds, starships. 
VORIN: That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they
believed in. I can't tell them the truth, but I don't think I can live
with a secret. 
PICARD: Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. 
VORIN: I need some time. Please. 
[Holodeck planet surface]

WORF: How could you have mated with a Boraalan?
What were you thinking? 
NIKOLAI: I don't owe you an explanation. This is a matter between
Dobara and me. 
WORF: As usual, you are thinking only of yourself. 
NIKOLAI: And as usual, you are here to point out the error of my ways. 
WORF: You have treated Dobara with dishonour. 
NIKOLAI: I have not! I love her and we're going to raise our child
together. 
WORF: That is not possible. I cannot allow you to stay here. 
NIKOLAI: You will have to kill me first. 
(as they square up, everything flickers) 
DOBARA: What does it mean ? 
NIKOLAI: The storms have returned. 
KATERAS: We will be killed. 
NIKOLAI: No, you won't. Worf has the power to end the storms once and
for all. 
WORF: Yes. But everyone must take shelter in the tents. 
KATERAS: The tents won't protect us. 
NIKOLAI: Worf will protect you. You must trust him. Hurry, hurry. Get
to your tents now. 
WORF: Commander, it might be helpful if you could produce
