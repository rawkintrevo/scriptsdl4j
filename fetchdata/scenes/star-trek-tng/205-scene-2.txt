LAFORGE: No. 
CRUSHER: Come on, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: No. 
CRUSHER: Just try it once. It is not as hard as you think. I'm telling
you, you will be terrific. 
LAFORGE: All right. (sings) I am the very model of a modern major
general, I've information vegetable, animal and mineral. I can't do
this. 
CRUSHER: Yes you can! 
LAFORGE: I cannot sing in front of people. 
CRUSHER: You were terrific! You were a little off pitch, but I think I
can take care of that. Okay, La Forge as a modern major general.

TROI: Captain, I'd like to introduce you to the
winners of the primary school science fair. This is Marissa, Jay
Gordon, and Patterson. They're here for their tour. 
PICARD: Hello. 
PATTERSON: Can we see the battle bridge and torpedo bay? 
PICARD: No, I'm afraid not. But we will be visiting the hydroponics and
astrophysics laboratories. 
TROI: I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. 
PICARD: Well. If you'll come with me. 
(Picard and children go into the turbolift as O'Brien comes out) 
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure who to feel sorry for, the Captain or the kids.
