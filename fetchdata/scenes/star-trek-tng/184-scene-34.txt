[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge.
I'll check in on you later. 
TROI: Really, you don't have to. 
RIKER: I will check in on you later.

[Bridge]

ALLENBY: Setting a new course at optimal shearing
angle. Bearing two one seven mark two zero three. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Engaging impulse 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Engines now. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, go to warp. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Status? 
ALLENBY: Unchanged. We have not broken free of the graviton field. 
DATA: Integrity-field pressure has increased by two hundred seventeen
percent, Captain. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Differential stress will exceed upper limit in
fifteen seconds. 
PICARD: Disengage all engines. 
[Engineering]

COMPUTER: Warning. Differential stress will exceed
upper 
LAFORGE: Engines disengaged, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Report, La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: The energy we wanted to transfer to the nacelles

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Was absorbed by the graviton wake instead.
It set up a torsional wave that rebounded back to the ship. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: We're lucky the hull is still in one
piece. 
PICARD: This little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination. 
DATA: Sir, during our attempt to break away, I recorded a momentary
alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster. 
RIKER: You think we got their attention, Data? 
DATA: Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediately
returned to its previous dynamic. 
PICARD: Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into the
Universal Translator. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt at
communication.
