TROI IAN PICARD RIKER PULASKI NURSE DATA

[Pulaski's office]

TROI: It's time. 
PULASKI: Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you to Maternity. 
DATA: Worf, assemble your security team in Sickbay. 
PULASKI: Is that necessary? 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. 
PULASKI: Well, it's strange to need armed guards in a delivery room.
This way. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: How frequent are your contractions? 
TROI: Very close together. 
PULASKI: In my other deliveries, except for a couple, the father was
always present. 
TROI: Difficult under the circumstances. 
DATA: Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. 
PULASKI: Counsellor Troi is going to need the comfort of a human touch,
not the cold hand of technology. 
TROI: Doctor, I think Commander Data will do very nicely. 
PULASKI: Your choice. 
(A little later, Deanna is in the birthing chair, almost upright) 
TROI: You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. 
PULASKI: There is nothing to be nervous about. 
DATA: Nervous? I find this very interesting. Although I understand, in
technical terms, how life is formed, there is still a part of the
process which eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to access
his thought process? Does he have thoughts? You are aware of him. Is he
aware of you? And when does that awareness begin? 
TROI: It's happening. 
DATA: How does it feel? 
TROI: Data! 
DATA: Yes? 
TROI: Now!
DATA: Now? Now! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! 
PULASKI: This is an impatient baby. He's eager to make his appearance.
Do you want something for the pain? It will in no way diminish the
experience. 
TROI: I have felt no pain. 
PULASKI: None? 
TROI: No, none at all. 
(Worf and two guards enter) 
PULASKI: Have your Security men stand back. I understand the importance
of having you here, but keep out from underfoot. Foetal position? 
NURSE: Normal. 
PULASKI: Foetal pulse? 
NURSE: One thirty seven. 
PULASKI: The baby is showing healthy respiratory movements. 
(Riker sneaks in to watch) 
PULASKI: (kneeling in front of Troi) The action of the heart rate is
good. The baby's doing wonderfully, Troi. Breathe slowly. You're doing
great. Stay calm. That's it. There it is. I've got him. You can relax. 
(Baby crying) 
PULASKI: (cleaning him off) There, there. That's a good boy. It's okay.
Oh, my, he's beautiful. (hands him to Troi) Are easy births the norm
for Betazoids? 
TROI: Not according to my mother. 
PULASKI: (to Worf) You can come in the rest of the way now. There's no
threat, Lieutenant. You and your men can relax. It's just a baby. 
(Worf looks and leaves) 
DATA: Thank you for allowing me to participate. It was remarkable. 
PULASKI: Do you have a name? 
TROI: Ian Andrew, after my father. 
(Riker comes forward) 
TROI: Were you hear all along? 
RIKER: Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. 
PULASKI: How do you feel? 
TROI: Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. 
PULASKI: Amazing.

[Bridge]

PULASKI: Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor. Welcome to the Bridge. Please, sit down. How is
Counsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? 
PULASKI: I've delivered dozens of babies, but none like this. There was
no pain, no trauma. 
RIKER: It's true. 
PULASKI: It was effortless for both of them. 
PICARD: I'm not sure of your point. 
PULASKI: She had her baby yesterday. If I were to examine her now, I
would not be able to tell she had a baby, or had ever had a baby. It
was as if the incident never happened. 
PICARD: Data, how long before we begin the transfer? 
DATA: Two hours nineteen minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paid
my respects.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. 
PICARD: Deanna, I wanted to see how you were and have a look at your
baby! My goodness. How old is he? 
(The boy is walking, and about waist height to Troi) 
PULASKI: In actuality, a day. 
PICARD: Yes, but 
PULASKI: In appearance, almost four earth years old. 
TROI: Ian, say hello to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: You mean he can talk? 
IAN: Hello. 
(Pulaski shudders) 
PICARD: Hello, Ian. 
IAN: Please don't worry. Everything is okay.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are faced with two
major problems. Troi's child and the deadly cargo we are about to take
on. In the hours since his birth, Troi's baby has continued his rapid
growth and now appears, physically and mentally, to be a child of
eight. Still there is no indication as to who he is, or why he is here.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Sickbay, this is the Bridge. We are ready to
begin loading. 
PULASKI [OC]: We need a little more time. It's taking longer than we
anticipated to categorise these specimens.

[Pulaski's office]

PULASKI: Da(h)ta, look at this. 
DATA: Data. 
PULASKI: What? 
DATA: My name. It is pronounced Data. 
PULASKI: Oh? 
DATA: You called me Da(h)ta. 
PULASKI: What's the difference? 
DATA: One is my name. The other is not. 
PULASKI: Is this possible? With all of your neural nets, algorithms,
and heuristics, is there some combination makes up a circuit for
bruised feelings? Possible? (returns to the monitor) I am unfamiliar
with this symbol. 
DATA: It indicates a genetically engineered biological life form. 
PULASKI: About twenty percent of the specimens fall into that category.
Some eager beaver at play. 
DATA: Query. Eager beaver? 
PULASKI: Well in this case, eager beaver refers to some overachieving
genetic engineer, who, probably because of lack of anything better to
do, has forced this strain of virus to mutate, just so we can see how
bad, bad can get. Captain Picard.
