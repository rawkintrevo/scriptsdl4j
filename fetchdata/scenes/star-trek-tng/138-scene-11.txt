(Nothing. Absolute void, except for..) 
DATA: Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away, yet they do
not appear to penetrate this breathable zone. 
RIKER: It's like the eye of a hurricane. 
WORF: Commander, what is that? 
(It is a revolving door, with art nouveau decoration. No building, just
the turning door and it's frame) 
RIKER: A door. 
DATA: The structure must be here, yet we cannot see it. 
RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Riker. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: As your read out shows, this is an
unusual place.

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Completely calm, no sound, no movement, yet
a few hundred metres away a storm is raging. 
PICARD [OC]: Any information about the structure. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. There is an antique revolving door. It could be an
entrance. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: A revolving door? Number One, proceed with
caution. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: Well, this is what we came here for.
Captain, we're entering.

[Lobby]

(Worf leads the way into a very elegant foyer and
lobby in a Middle Eastern style. Lots of marble and palm plants, very
twenties or thirties. We hear the laughter of people having a good time
at blackjack tables)
