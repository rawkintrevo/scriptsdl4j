[Town square]

(from the cool shade of a colonnade, Picard watches
a tree-planting ceremony) 
BATAI: Thank you. This sapling is planted as an affirmation of life in
defiance of the drought and with expectations of long life.
Whatever comes, we will keep it alive as a symbol of our survival.
Kamin! You're back on your feet! How do you feel, my friend? 
PICARD: Are you in charge here? 
BATAI: In charge? 
PICARD: I want to be returned to my ship immediately. 
BATAI: What ship is that? 
PICARD: Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I? 
BATAI: The fever. It's taken your memory. 
PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you can help me. 
BATAI: Anything, my friend. 
PICARD: My name is Kamin? 
BATAI: Yes. 
PICARD: And you are? 
BATAI: Batai. Council leader Batai. 
PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill? 
BATAI: For more than a week. Eline should've put you in the hospital,
but she insisted on caring for you herself. 
PICARD: Eline? 
BATAI: Your wife. If you don't remember that, maybe it's safer not to
go home. 
PICARD: And what is this place? 
BATAI: Perhaps you should see the doctor. 
PICARD: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me. 
BATAI: This is the community of Ressik. Northern province. 
PICARD: What planet? 
BATAI: Let me take you back home. 
PICARD: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet? 
BATAI: This is the planet Kataan. 
PICARD: Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk.

BATAI: But you've been ill for a week. 
PICARD: The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myself
with the surroundings. 
(he goes up into the hills and looks down on the white-walled community
perched on an outcrop above a very small river) 
[Living room]

(its late when the doorbell chimes) 
ELINE: Thank goodness. I've had people out trying to find you
everywhere. Why did you worry us like that? Are you hungry? 
PICARD: Hungry, thirsty, exhausted. I suppose that proves this is not a
dream, doesn't it? 
ELINE: You think this, your life, is a dream? 
PICARD: This is not my life. I know that much. 
ELINE: I've kept something hot for you. Where did you go? 
PICARD: I walked. For hours. 
ELINE: And you're just out of bed. 
(she hands him a plate of soup) 
PICARD: It's delicious. 
ELINE: You always say that. 
PICARD: Would you try to answer some questions for me, no matter how
strange they may seem to you? 
ELINE: Of course. 
PICARD: Are there other planets in this star system? Do you visit other
systems? All right. Do you have a communication system here? How do you
send messages to other communities, to other places? 
ELINE: The usual way, by voice-transit conductor. Do you want to send a
message? 
PICARD: Yes. When can that be arranged? 
ELINE: Tomorrow. Don't you want to ask about us? 
PICARD: Of course. Anything you can tell me will be helpful. We're, er,
um, married? 
ELINE: Three years ago. The happiest day of my life was the day we got
married. 
PICARD: And what do I do here in Ressik? 
ELINE: You're the best iron weaver in the community. At least I think
so. You prefer playing the flute, of course. 
PICARD: The flute? 
ELINE: Yes. 
(she fetches him a penny whistle decorated with a tassel) 
PICARD: And when did I learn to play it? 
ELINE: I'm afraid you never did, dear, but you keep trying. 
(he gives it a trial blow) 
PICARD: I see what you mean. Well, thank you for the soup. Thank you
for your help. Tomorrow, will you help me send a message? 
ELINE: Of course. Will you come to bed? 
PICARD: Oh, I'll sleep here. 
ELINE: Kamin, please come with me. 
PICARD: I've been sick. I'll be tossing and turning. It wouldn't be
fair to you. 
ELINE: Let me be the judge of that. 
(as she leans forward he sees a pendant on a necklace - it is the same
design as probe that the Enterprise encountered) PICARD: Where did you
get this? 
ELINE: Kamin, this is the first gift you ever gave me.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. The Captain's hurt. 
(Beverly is scanning Picard) 
CRUSHER: Pulse and blood pressure are normal I'm getting hyperactive
fibrogenic activity. This is odd. 
RIKER: What is it? 
CRUSHER: There's no evidence of any injury or trauma. Vital signs are
normal, but neurotransmitter production is off the scale. What's going
on? 
RIKER: That probe is doing something to him. Anything yet, Data? 
DATA: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable to
block it. 
WORF: We should destroy the probe. Phasers are armed and ready. 
CRUSHER: I don't think that's wise. Not until we know exactly what it's
doing to him. 
RIKER: Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf. In the meantime, take
us out of range. Ensign. Thrusters only, one hundred kph nice and easy 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
DATA: The probe is moving with us, sir, holding relative position. 
CRUSHER: It's connected itself to him, like a tether.
