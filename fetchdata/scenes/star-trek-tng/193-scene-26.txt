LARSON: We're having trouble containing reactor
nine, sir. It's starting to chain. 
LAFORGE [OC]: I'm on my way. 
[Ready room]

RIKER: You said he made a pass at you, but you
failed to mention whether he was successful or not. 
(the answer is a grin)

[Engineering]

BARCLAY: Thermal levels up one hundred seventy
seven percent. Comparable increase in neutron emissions. 
LAFORGE: Is the interface between the computer and the array still in
operation? 
BARCLAY: Yes, but our computer is too slow to direct the repairs. The
parameters are changing too quickly for it to keep up. 
LAFORGE: Then we'll have to try a remote shutdown from here. 
LARSON: Transmitting commands to the array now, sir. Starting close
down sequence. 
BARCLAY: Brower, increase the intake of liquid helium three into the
reactor wall. We've got to cool it off. 
BROWER: Transmitting commands. Thermal levels increasing, sir. 
LAFORGE: What happened? 
BARCLAY: Unclear. The interface isn't fast enough. 
LARSON: Commander La Forge. Overload indications on Argus generator
five, seven and fourteen. 
LAFORGE: Damn! 
BARCLAY: I can't do anything from here. I have to find a better
interface. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. We're looking at a cascade reactor failure
on the Argus.

LAFORGE [OC]: I don't think we're going to pull
this one out. 
DATA: Reactor Nine will reach critical in ten minutes, forty three
seconds. The subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along
the entire length of the Array, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, standby for a jump to warp two. 
ANAYA: Yes, Sir. 
RIKER: La Forge, you've got ten minutes. Mister Worf, Red alert. 
WORF: Aye, Commander.

BARCLAY: Computer, begin new programme. Create as
follows, workstation chair. (he sits in it) Now, create a standard
alphanumeric console positioned for left hand. Now an iconic display
console positioned for right hand. Tie both consoles into the
Enterprise main computer core, utilising neural-scan interface. 
COMPUTER: There is no such device on file. 
BARCLAY: No problem. Here's how you build it.
