GORTA RIKER DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Bridge]

DATA: We are approaching Kalla Three. 
RIKER: Set a standard orbit. Any evidence of a mining expedition? 
WORF: A shaft has been cut through the outer crust. There is evidence
of machinery, but it does not appear to be in use. 
RIKER: Life signs? 
DATA: It is difficult to say. The magnesite is interfering with
bioreadings. 
RIKER: Assemble an away team.

[Mine]

LAFORGE: Who are you? 
GORTA: Gorta. I am Gorta. 
WORF: What are you doing on this planet? 
GORTA: I crashed here. 
DATA: Then you are denying involvement in illegal mining activities? 
GORTA: Mining? So that's what all this equipment is here for. 
WORF: We are looking for two Klingon women. Sisters. 
GORTA: Lursa? B'Etor? Do you know where they are? 
LAFORGE: Actually we were hoping that you did. 
GORTA: Maybe I do. 
DATA: Would you be willing to share your information with us? 
GORTA: My personal code of conduct prohibits sharing. But I'd consider
a trade. 
LAFORGE: Does your personal code of conduct tell you that when you're
stranded on a planet with no way off, you shouldn't try to cut deals? 
GORTA: You have a point. 
DATA: We could certainly provide passage off this planet in exchange
for information. 
GORTA: Could you perhaps fail to tell the Pakleds that we were mining
their ore? 
LAFORGE: Don't push your luck. But if you get us to the Duras sisters,
I'll see what I can do. 
GORTA: The Duras sisters. They are magnificent, aren't they? 
WORF: Where are they now? 
GORTA: Selling the ore, I imagine. They took everything. The ore, the
ship. 
WORF: And where have they gone? 
GORTA: We were going to sell the ore to a Yridian trader. We were
supposed to meet him in the Ufandi system. 
DATA: Gather your belongings. It is time to leave. 
GORTA: Like I said, they took everything.
