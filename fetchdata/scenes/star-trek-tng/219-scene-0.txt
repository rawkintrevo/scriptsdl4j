[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, Starfleet Academy is requesting an
update on our estimated arrival. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: We should be arriving at Earth in ten hours sixteen minutes, sir.

PICARD: Please inform the Academy, Mister Worf, and send my regards to
Superintendant Brand. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
TROI: Do you know Admiral Brand? 
PICARD: We've met a few times. She's a formidable woman. 
RIKER: Sounds like my superintendent. When I was at the Academy, we had
a Vulcan Superintendent who had memorised the personnel files of every
single cadet. He knew everything about them. It was like having your
parents around all the time. 
PICARD: My superintendent was a Betazoid, a full telepath. When he sent
for you to his office, he didn't have to ask what you'd done. 
RIKER: You got called into the superintendent's office? That's a story
I'd like to hear. 
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed again by the Academy. It is Admiral
Brand. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: Sir, she is requesting a private channel. 
PICARD: In my Ready room.
