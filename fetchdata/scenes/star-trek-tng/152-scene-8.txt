(Liko and Oji have climbed up to investigate the
flashes, and can see the duckblind quite clearly now) 
LIKO: You wait here, Oji. 
(Liko climbs right up to the window and looks inside) 
[Duck blind]

CRUSHER: Enterprise, beam Martinez and his patient
directly to Sickbay. 
DATA: Commander. 
(Liko touches the metal frame and gets a shock. He falls from the cliff
face) 
[Hillside]

RIKER: Doctor, be careful. 
CRUSHER: I've got to get down there. 
(Oji hides and watches as Crusher runs down to Liko, scans him then
makes her decision) 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Enterprise. Medical emergency. Two to beam directly
to Sickbay. 
OGAWA [OC]: Aye, Doctor. 
(Oji sees the strange woman and her father vanish) 
[Duck blind]

LAFORGE: That should do it. 
(It does. Oji sees the window disappear and be replaced by the cliff
face. Curious, she investigates) 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: (to nurse) You increased the levels of
tricordrazine? (re Barron) Let me see his chart, please. 
(dialogue too faint to make out, and Picard enters) 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Before you start quoting me the Prime Directive, he'd already
seen us. The damage was done. It was either bring him aboard or let him
die. 
PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die? 
CRUSHER: Because we were responsible for his injuries. 
PICARD: I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But now
that he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with the
away team. 
CRUSHER: By erasing short term recall? 
PICARD: It has been accomplished before. 
CRUSHER: I am familiar with Doctor Pulaski's technique. I can't
guarantee it will be effective on Mintakan brain chemistry. Their
lie-zone levels are much lower. 
BARRON: Wait. No! No! We must evacuate. 
CRUSHER: Doctor Barron, you're on the Enterprise. You're safe. 
BARRON: The others? 
PICARD: Doctor Warren is here. We're doing all we can. 
(Liko wakes up and listens) 
BARRON: And Palmer? Where is Palmer? 
PICARD: Still on Mintaka Three. 
BARRON: Picard, you have to find him. 
PICARD: We will. 
BARRON: He may be hurt. 
PICARD: Rest assured we shall not leave until he is located. 
BARRON: Thank you, Picard. 
PICARD: Picard to bridge. Report. 
WORF [OC]: Scans of the planet detect no humans, Captain. 
PICARD: Very well. Put us into a close orbit. 
WORF [OC]: Sir, a close orbit will increase sensor efficiency by only
four percent. 
PICARD: I want that four percent, Lieutenant. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Picard out. 
LIKO: Picard? 
CRUSHER: Damn. 
PICARD: Well, Doctor. Your next task is clear.
