PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE

[Bridge]

PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, Number One. Proceed. 
[Batris Corridor]

RIKER: Let's go. 
(As they move on, a conduit falls. This ship is ready to fall apart) 
DATA: I am detecting high levels of deuterium gas, probably from the
leakage in the drive system. 
RIKER: Toxic? 
DATA: Not as yet, sir. The life signs are emanating from the far side
of Engineering. 
RIKER: What's the safest way around? 
DATA: All routes are equally dangerous, sir. 
LAFORGE: Well, what's the least dangerous route, Data? 
DATA: There is no significant difference. 
RIKER: Steady on. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker! Commander. 
RIKER: Yes, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: There's a fissure developing in the bulkhead. The skin of the
ship is losing its integrity. 
RIKER: Where is it? I can't see it. 
LAFORGE: Right there.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Geordi, step closer. It looks to me like a
spectrograph indicating metal fatigue. 
[Batris Corridor]

PICARD [OC]: Is that how you interpret it? 
LAFORGE: Very good, Captain. Exactly right. 
RIKER: How long before this hull ruptures? 
LAFORGE: It's impossible to be exact. I'd say five minutes. Probably
less. 
RIKER: Let's go.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Geordi, we've lost transmission. 
[Batris Engineering]

(As well as debris, there is a bright light source)

LAFORGE: Signal overload. I'm surprised it lasted this long. 
RIKER: We've reached the core, Captain. 
DATA: The life signs are very strong now, sir. They are coming from
over there. 
RIKER: Is there any other way around? 
DATA: Negative. This is the only way. The safest way to proceed is for
me to cross alone. The heat and toxic gases have less effect on me. 
RIKER: Agreed. Captain, Data's gone ahead. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: The life signs seem to be coming from
the far side of Engineering.
