RIKER MACDUFF LAFORGE WORF PICARD RO

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I've accessed the optical data network for
the engineering core. I can monitor every system that's routed through
here. 
RO: Warp and impulse drive are reading within tolerance levels. So are
the tactical arrays, defensive and offensive. 
LAFORGE: Everything looks functional. Now, if we could just access the
control systems, we could get them up and running. 
RIKER: According to the schematics, the engineering computer core
access is down that corridor. 
RO: Weapons, propulsion and shields are the priorities. We could be in
danger of another attack. 
LAFORGE: That's where I'll start. 
RIKER: We'll begin our crew survey on decks five through ten. When you
get those systems going, try to pull up the personnel files. It'd be
nice if we all had names. Right. Good luck. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. You too.

[Ready room]

(Picard and MacDuff report to Captain Worf) 
PICARD: So far our survey team has found no deaths or injuries among
the crew. Shuttlecraft are all operational, as are the transporters. 
MACDUFF: But no one they've talked to knows any more about their
identities than we do. 
WORF: Engineering is working on accessing the control systems. As soon
as the ship is operational, we must make it combat ready. 
PICARD: Well, I would recommend that before we prepare for combat, we
try to access the ship's logs, find out who we are, what our purpose
here might be. 
WORF: I disagree. We must first make ourselves ready for battle. That
is the highest priority. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. 
WORF: Go ahead.
