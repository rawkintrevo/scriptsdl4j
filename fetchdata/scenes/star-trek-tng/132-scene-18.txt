TROI SCHOLAR WORF PICARD RIKER ADONIS ALIEN WESLEY

[Bridge]

WESLEY: We're approaching Solais Five. 
RIKER: Half impulse. 
WESLEY: Slowing to one half impulse.

[Guest quarters]

(Troi and Riva are eating, as the Adonis stands
nearby) 
ADONIS: The sound of this ship is quite remarkable. Can't you feel it? 
TROI: Yes. 
ADONIS: It moves through my body like a great pulse. 
TROI: I've grown so accustomed to it, I forget it's there. 
ADONIS: It's easy to let that happen. Sometimes we must allow the
surroundings to flow over us, to dwell on each separate part, how it
feels, to allow it to fill you. 
(The Adonis leaves) 
TROI: How do we communicate? I know you can read lips, but I need your
words. 
(Riva begins to use sign language and Troi works out their meaning.) 
TROI: Words are here on top. What's under them, their meaning, is
what's important. Yes, that's true. We both know how to express
important words, like dream. Being here with you. Yes, being here with
you know is very special to me, too.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Standard orbit. 
WORF: Captain, I'm reading laser activity on the Solais Five. 
RIKER: How concentrated is the activity? 
WORF: It is localised, but very intense. 
RIKER: So much for the cease fire. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: I'm receiving one side only. 
PICARD: This is Captain Jean Luc Picard, commander of the Federation
starship USS Enterprise. If you continue to violate the cease fire, I
will abort this mission. 
(The viewscreen image has lots of interference.) 
ALIEN 1 [on viewscreen]: You have no jurisdiction here, Picard. Where
is Riva? 
PICARD: Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that brings
him. I will not endanger this ship under any circumstances. 
WORF: The other faction is breaking through, sir. 
ALIEN 2 [on viewscreen]: Riva gave his word we would speak to no one
else. Now who breaks the rules? Where is Riva? 
PICARD: I shall summon him for you. Get Riva here. 
[Guest quarters]

RIKER [OC]: Counsellor Troi, please have Riva
report to the Bridge. 
TROI: They need you on the Bridge, now.

[Bridge]

(Troi, Riva and the whole Chorus enter) 
PICARD: The cease fire has been broken. 
SCHOLAR: I'm sure I can resolve that. Put them on the viewscreen. 
PICARD: Viewer on. 
WORF: The quality of the transmission is very poor. 
SCHOLAR: It is sufficient. 
ADONIS: Brothers. Your bravery as fighters is known. Now you must
demonstrate courage in a new way. Cease hostilities. Allow us to meet. 
WORF: The laser fire has ceased. 
RIKER: For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates for
peace. 
SCHOLAR: I will need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area
in order to pick a site for the meetings. Then I will need your help in
creating the proper setting. 
RIKER: Worf, prepare your security team. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
ADONIS: That's not necessary. 
RIKER: But it is prudent. 
ADONIS: I prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement. We do
not want to add to an already tense situation. 
PICARD: If that is your judgement, so be it. We are here to provide
whatever service you require. 
ADONIS: Thank you, Captain. 
(At an aft station, looking at a map) 
SCHOLAR: There. beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to
join us. The time for killing is come to an end.
