[Athenaeum]

GUEST5: A thousand years ago our planet was dying.
Overcrowded and dangerous city states warred unceasingly with each
other. The air and water were polluted with industrial waste and there
was a constant threat of starvation and epidemic. 
GUEST2: And then what happened? 
GUEST5: And then you came. 
PICARD: Objection. There is no conclusive evidence that this woman ever
visited the planet a thousand years ago. 
GUEST2: I suppose you want a thousand year old witness? 
PICARD: That would be acceptable. 
GUEST2: Jared. In the contract, does it specify how you would know me
when I return? 
GUEST5: Yes by the date. 
GUEST2: Anything else? 
GUEST5: by the shaking of the cities, and by the visions.
GUEST2: And all of these occurred on schedule? 
GUEST5: Yes. 
GUEST2: Thank you. Your honour, I submit that I have established my
identity as stated by the contract. 
DATA: Captain Picard, my interpretation of Ventaxian law suggests under
these circumstances, this is acceptable. Your objection is overruled. 
PICARD: But, your honour! 
DATA: Sir, I have ruled. Please sit down. You may proceed. 
GUEST2: Thank you, your Honour. Now, when I first set foot on Ventax
Two, what did I offer your people? 
GUEST5: According to the scrolls, you offered us a thousand years of
peace and prosperity, if we would promise to surrender ourselves to you
at the end of the term. 
GUEST2: Now why do you think they would strike such a bargain? 
GUEST5: We had nothing to lose. There was no hope in sight. 
GUEST2: Until I came along. 
PICARD: Objection! 
GUEST2: I withdraw the observation. No further questions. 
PICARD: Your Honour, nothing in this testament proves that Ardra had
the power to affect the lives of the Ventaxians. My opponent has failed
to prove her case and I move that her claim be summarily dismissed. 
DATA: I find no cause to invalidate the contract at this time. The
arbitration will continue. 
GUEST2: Your Honour, Captain Picard as a new visitor to my planet has
been a consistent doubter of my abilities. I would like to ask him a
few questions, if I may. 
DATA: It is highly irregular to question the opposing advocate, but I
see no reason to deny it. Proceed. 
GUEST2: Please don't take any offence at these questions, you know how
fond I am of you. 
PICARD: Objection. 
DATA: Sustained. The advocate will refrain from expressing personal
affections for her opponent. 
GUEST2: You do not believe my powers are real, do you. 
PICARD: No, I don't. 
GUEST2: Then, sir, may I ask you to explain this. 
(the ground shakes) 
DATA: You are out of order. 
GUEST2: Or this? 
(Picard vanishes) 
DATA: The advocate will refrain from making her opponent disappear. 
(Picard returns) 
GUEST2: Or this? 
(he's big, red, and has goat's horns) 
GUEST3: Can you explain it, Picard? 
DATA: Any more disruptions and I will rule you in contempt of court. Is
that understood? 
GUEST2: I am sorry, your Honour, but can you explain it, Picard? Yes or
no. 
PICARD: No. 
GUEST2: I rest my case, your Honour.
