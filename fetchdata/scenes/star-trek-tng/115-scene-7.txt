PICARD: I want all departments prepared for a warp
six trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team completes its
mission. 
WORF: Trouble, Captain? 
PICARD: Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been detected near one
of our border posts. 
[Corridor]

(Picard steps out of the turbolift into a snowball)

PICARD: They've requested assistance as soon as Argh! 
(The culprits leave the holodeck) 
PICARD: Report, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: We finished our ski lesson, sir, and it kind of just happened. 
PICARD: On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just happens. What
is that smell? 
WORF: Hmm, yes. Slightly reminiscent of night blooming throgni,
Captain. From home. Quite stimulating, wouldn't you say? 
PICARD: No. 
WESLEY: I don't smell anything. I'm a little congested. The snow. 
PICARD: Don't let this just happen again, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.

(Data has found an atomiser, and gives himself a
face-full) 
DATA: Interesting. An alcohol-based synthetic, artificially reproducing
a floral scent. 
TROI: It's called perfume, Data. 
DATA: The purpose of which is? 
TASHA: Certain cultures consider perfume an aphrodisiac. 
DATA: I am unfamiliar with that term. 
RIKER: An aphrodisiac is something used to stimulate or enhance sexual
pleasure.
DATA: How does stimulation of the olfactory nerves affect the enjoyment
of sex? 
(Trent enters) 
TRENT: The Elected One will see you now. 
(When the group have left, he sprays himself with the perfume)
