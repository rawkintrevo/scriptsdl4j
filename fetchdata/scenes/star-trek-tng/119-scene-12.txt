WESLEY TROI REMMICK LAFORGE WORF

[Engineering]

REMMICK: So, you are saying Captain Picard had no
control over this vessel. He handed it over to Kosinski, who took the
entire crew to the edge of the universe. 
LAFORGE: No, sir. That's not what I'm saying. Now, Kosinski was sent by
Starfleet to improve our warp drive system. Captain Picard was ordered
to take him aboard. 
REMMICK: According to his own logs, his Bridge crew didn't think highly
of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet the Captain allowed him to access to
the engines anyway. Is that true, La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Not exactly, sir. 
REMMICK: One way or the other, La Forge, Picard lost control of this
ship. Is that true? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but that's not how it happened. 
REMMICK: So, the answer is yes.

[Ready room]

REMMICK: Do you believe the captain is emotionally
and psychologically fit for command of this starship? There is nothing
in his history or his personality that would suggest mental lapses? 
TROI: Nothing. 
REMMICK: Not even the Ferengi incident with his old ship, the
Stargazer? 
TROI: He was being controlled by a mind altering machine, Commander.
Without his knowledge. 
REMMICK: I would call that a mental lapse.

[Holodeck]

(There is no programme running) 
WORF: Ensign, what are you doing on the holodeck? I thought you were
still on Relva Seven. 
WESLEY: I'm finished testing for the day. 
WORF: I've disturbed you. I'll leave. 
WESLEY: Wait. I thought I wanted to be alone, but I guess I don't. 
WORF: How is the testing? 
WESLEY: Okay. So far. It's not the ones that I've studied for that I'm
worried about. It's the psych test. Facing my deepest fear and living
through it. I'm trying to figure out what images to bring up. 
WORF: Why? 
WESLEY: I guess I want to scare myself. What do you think? Bulgallian
rats? Lightning storms? 
WORF: Do those things frighten you? 
WESLEY: Sort of, I guess. 
WORF: The psych test is no more or less important than the rest of the
process. 
WESLEY: That's what they said, but I can't stop thinking about it. 
WORF: Thinking about what you can't control only wastes your energy and
creates its own enemy. 
WESLEY: How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't? 
WORF: By analysing your psychological profile. They were very accurate
about everyone I tested with. Including myself. 
WESLEY: You? I thought there was nothing that could frighten a Klingon
warrior. 
WORF: Only fools have no fear. 
WESLEY: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm asking too many personal questions. 
WORF: It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything. But
especially for my life. 
WESLEY: But on the Enterprise you do that every day. Everyone depends
on everyone else to protect them. 
WORF: Yes. 
WESLEY: So you overcame it? 
WORF: No. It is still my enemy.
