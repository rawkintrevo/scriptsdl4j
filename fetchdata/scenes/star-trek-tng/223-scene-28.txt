RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD BORG CRUSHER DATA

[Ready room]

WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain Picard.
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant.
WORF [OC]: We are ready to transport.
PICARD: Proceed.
(Worf and Hugh are beamed in) 
PICARD: Lieutenant, you may wait outside.
(Worf hesitates then leaves) 
BORG: Locutus.
PICARD: Yes. I am Locutus of Borg.
BORG: Why are you here?
PICARD: This is a primitive culture. I am here to facilitate its
incorporation. Identify yourself.
BORG: Hugh.
PICARD: Identify yourself.
BORG: We are Hugh.
PICARD: This is not a Borg identification.
BORG: Third of Five.
PICARD: This culture will be assimilated.
BORG: They do not wish it.
PICARD: Irrelevant.
BORG: They will resist us.
PICARD: Resistance is futile.
BORG: Resistance is not futile. Some have escaped.
PICARD: They will be found. It is inevitable. All will be assimilated.
BORG: Must Geordi be assimilated?
PICARD: Yes.
BORG: He does not wish it. He would rather die than be assimilated.
PICARD: Then he will die.
BORG: No. Geordi must not die. Geordi is a friend.
PICARD: You will assist us to assimilate this vessel. You are Borg. You
will assist us.
BORG: I will not.
PICARD: What did you say?
BORG: I will not assist you.
PICARD: I?
BORG: Geordi must not be assimilated.
PICARD: But you are Borg.
BORG: No. I am Hugh.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: I think I deliberately avoided speaking
with the Borg because I didn't want anything to get in the way of our
plan.
But now that I have, he seems to be a fully realised individual. He has
even accepted me as Picard, Captain of this ship, and not as Locutus.
LAFORGE: So you've reconsidered the plan?
PICARD: Yes. To use him in this manner, we'd be no better than the
enemy that we seek to destroy. So, I want other options.
RIKER: We could return him to the crash site. We'd have to remove his
memory of being on the Enterprise.
CRUSHER: But if we erase his memory, who he is or who he has become
would be destroyed.
RIKER: Isn't that the point? He'd be reassimilated into the hive
without any questions.
LAFORGE: Does that seems right, to help him become an individual and
then take that away from him? 
CRUSHER: Is there any danger that the Borg might destroy him if they
find out what's happened?
PICARD: I doubt it. There'd be nothing to gain. It's more likely that
they would simply wipe out his memory of those experiences.
RIKER: Then either way, his memory would have been erased.
PICARD: But perhaps in that short time before they purge his memory,
the sense of individuality which he has gained here might be
transmitted throughout the entire Borg Collective. Every one of the
Borg being given the opportunity to experience the feeling of
singularity. Perhaps that's the most pernicious programme of all. The
knowledge of self being spread throughout the Collective, in that brief
moment, might alter them forever. We leave his memory intact.
CRUSHER: I have a question. What if he doesn't want to go back?

[Ready room]

LAFORGE: Hello, Hugh.
BORG: Hello, Geordi.
PICARD: Hugh, a Borg rescue vessel is approaching. It will be here
within three hours. We can return you to the crash site, where they
will find you and take then you home. Or, if you wish, you can stay
here with us.
BORG: What I wish is irrelevant.
LAFORGE: It's not irrelevant, Hugh. It matters to us.
BORG: No Borg leaves the Collective. If they find I am missing, they
will come for me.
PICARD: Well, we'll deal with the repercussions later. We must know
what you want.
BORG: You are many, I am one. What I want is not important.
LAFORGE: Don't you understand, Hugh? We're giving you a choice.
BORG: Choice?
LAFORGE: Yes, a choice. Do you want to go back with the Borg or stay
with us?
BORG: I could stay with you?
PICARD: We could grant you asylum, Hugh.
BORG: Choose what I want? I would choose to stay with Geordi, but it is
too dangerous. They will follow. Return me to the crash site. It is the
only way.
LAFORGE: Hugh, think about this. Are you sure?
BORG: Yes.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: The Borg ship will enter orbit in one hour.
You'll soon be headed home. We'll beam him down and then we'll take up
a position in the star's chromosphere. The interference will hide us
from their sensors. 
CRUSHER: Goodbye, Hugh. It was nice getting to know you.
BORG: Goodbye, Beverly. You saved my life.
LAFORGE: Hugh, it's not too late to change your mind. 
BORG: I must return.
LAFORGE: Captain, I'd like to go down with him.
PICARD: My experience suggests that they would ignore him. Would you
agree?
BORG: The Borg assimilate civilisations, not individuals.
CRUSHER: But, Captain, they kidnapped you. 
PICARD: Because they needed a liaison to communicate with humans. They
ignored every away team we sent to their ship, including yours, Doctor.
You may accompany him. Goodbye.
BORG: Captain, I do not want to forget that I am Hugh.
PICARD: Energise.

[Crash site]

LAFORGE: We found you there, in the middle of that
debris.
BORG: Then that is where I will wait.

[Bridge]

DATA: We are now entering position. Radiation
levels are rising.
PICARD: Increase power to the shields. Hold us here.
RIKER: Status of the Borg ship?
DATA: Solar radiation is rendering our sensors inoperable. At last
known course and speed, the Borg vessel should enter the system in
three minutes.
