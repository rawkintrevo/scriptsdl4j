LAFORGE: Data, what if I missed something? 
DATA: The ship's computer would have corrected immediately. 
LAFORGE: Maybe my inputs were incorrect. 
WESLEY: Data! Geordi! I figured out Worf's problem. 
LAFORGE: You spoke to him? 
WESLEY: No, no. I accessed the complete Klingon cultural database. It
took me some time 
LAFORGE: Okay, Wesley, slow down. What is the problem? 
WESLEY: It's the tenth anniversary of Worf's Age of Ascension. 
LAFORGE: His what? 
WESLEY: The Klingon Age of Ascension. It's a ritual of great
significance. A rite of initiation marking a new level of Klingon
spiritual attainment. 
DATA: And what is the significance of the anniversary of this event? 
WESLEY: It's a day of celebration and ritual spent with one's fellow
Klingons. Worf doesn't have any Klingon friends. 
LAFORGE: We're his friends. 
WESLEY: Right, but we don't practice Klingon tradition, And we're not
Klingons. Worf is feeling culturally and socially isolated. 
LAFORGE: So, what do you suggest we do? I'm not sure I'd like to invite
a bunch of Klingons on board. 
DATA: We can programme the ship's computer to supply simulations on the
Holodeck. 
LAFORGE: Holographic Klingons. Sure. Why not? 
DATA: We need only to programme the computer with details of the
specific ceremony. 
WESLEY: The cultural database said the Klingon's family must attend. 
LAFORGE: So? We're his family. We'll go. I just wonder what kind of
party the Klingons had in mind.

RIKER: Have you got a minute? 
PULASKI: Sure. 
RIKER: I wanted to apologize for my remark in Ten Forward. Your
personal is none of my business. 
PULASKI: Even if it involves your father? 
RIKER: Even if it involves my father. 
PULASKI: Did he ever tell you why he never remarried? 
RIKER: What woman would have him with an ego like that? 
PULASKI: I would have, in a cold minute. Twelve years ago, Kyle Riker
was a civilian strategist advising Starfleet in its conflict with the
Tholians. The starbase that he was operating from was attacked. None of
the base crew was expected to live, and they all died. All except your
father. Your father alone had the will to endure, to face the pain, to
live. 
RIKER: I never knew any of that about him. 
PULASKI: I've never saw a man fight so hard in all my life. 
RIKER: And you fell in love? 
PULASKI: Yes. And so did he. But marriage was out of the question. He
had other priorities. 
RIKER: His career. 
PULASKI: You know, if I were you, going out on the Ares, I'd jettison
the emotional baggage you're still carrying around.
