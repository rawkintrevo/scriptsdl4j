[Ten Forward]

(Kate is at the bar, O'Brien and a moody Riker are
at a table) 
O'BRIEN: Female? 
RIKER: No. 
O'BRIEN: Career? Career? 
RIKER: Family. 
O'BRIEN: That is trouble. You choose your enemies, you choose your
friends, but family? That's in the stars. 
RIKER: So I've heard. 
(Kyle Riker enters and surveys the room) 
MAN: Kyle Riker! Excuse me, ladies. Great to see you. 
MAN 2: Kyle. Been a long time. 
PULASKI: This is more than a surprise. It's total shock. 
KYLE: You mean you didn't bake me a cake? 
PULASKI: You're actually here. 
KYLE: That makes two of us. How about a drink? 
PULASKI: How about a kiss? 
(A quick peck and a hug) 
RIKER: They know each other. 
O'BRIEN: No kidding. I know her too, but we don't do that. 
(Kyle and Kate sit together) 
KYLE: You look wonderful.

DATA: And it has nothing to do with Commander
Riker's new assignment? 
WESLEY: No. His reaction was just the opposite of mine. Completely
unaffected. 
LAFORGE: You see? With all that's going on, maybe you're overreacting. 
WESLEY: Really? You try talking to Worf, Geordi. I'm telling you, he is
not normal for Worf. 
DATA: There is, of course, a genetic predisposition toward hostility
among all Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. 
LAFORGE: Come on, he's never been much on charm. 
WESLEY: Well, whatever is troubling him, I think we should try to help.
He is our friend. 
LAFORGE: I for one want to keep him friendly. 
WESLEY: Suggestions? 
DATA: Empirical study. Monitor the subject. 
WESLEY: Right. Watch the subject for any signs of unusual behaviour. 
LAFORGE: That won't be difficult. 
DATA: Within the norm of Klingon patterns, of course. Discretion will
be required. 
WESLEY: Agreed. When do we start? 
LAFORGE: We will assist you as needed. You found the problem. 
DATA: And you must solve it.
