PICARD AARON REMMICK CRUSHER SAVAR

[Ante room]

AARON: What do you know of conspiracies, Captain? 
PICARD: Not nearly enough, I suppose. 
AARON: That's the charming thing about them, isn't it? When a
machination is real, no one knows about it. And when it's suspected,
it's almost never real. 
SAVAR: Except, of course, in paranoid delusions for those who believe. 
REMMICK: Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is served. 
AARON: Wonderful. Bantering with the Captain has given me quite an
appetite. 
PICARD: I need to contact my ship to let Commander Riker that we're
about to sit down. 
SAVAR: Of course, Captain. We'll wait for you at the table. 
(Picard is left alone) 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher here, Captain. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: May I speak freely? 
[Ante room]

PICARD: I suppose I have little choice. Where's
Riker? 
CRUSHER [OC]: He was attacked by Quinn, or what we thought was Quinn. 
PICARD: Specify, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: A parasitic being has invaded Quinn's
body. It has complete control over all brain functions. It seems to
breath through a small gill protruding from the back of Quinn's neck.
