[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: The Ferengi Government is debating an amendment to the Rules of
Acquisition. It could be a while before we hear from them. Data found
out that the woman you mentioned has a son named Jason. This is the
most recent picture we could find. 
PICARD: How old is the boy now? 
RIKER: Twenty three. He and his mother left Earth twelve years ago.
They settled on Camor Five. That's all we know. The planet's records
are virtually non-existent. 
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. Set a course for the Camor system, warp five.

HELM [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Will, I do appreciate your not asking, but I do think that you
have a right to know. There is a possibility that the boy is my son. I
was involved with his mother for a short time about twenty four years
ago. We met through a friend when I was on shore leave on Earth. It was
all very romantic, very intense, probably because we both knew I would
be leaving in two weeks. And we kept in touch for a while, but we never
managed to get together again. 
RIKER: She never said anything to you about being pregnant? 
PICARD: No, so either Bok is wrong and I'm not the father, or Miranda
decided to raise the child alone, which quite frankly wouldn't surprise
me. She was very independent, very strong willed. 
RIKER: She would have to be to get by on Camor Five. 
PICARD: But whether he's my son or not, he's in danger. Bok tried to
kill me six years ago, and I don't doubt he will try to make good his
threat against the boy.
