[Durken's office]

CRUSHER [OC]: But there's still some brain
activity. I need to get him back to the ship. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. 
CRUSHER [OC]: And there's a Malconian male with a phaser wound in his
upper chest. I need to get him back as well. 
PICARD: We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Picard out.

(Picard, Durken and Mirasta enter) 
CRUSHER: They're both going to be okay. We were able to stabilise Will.
If we had been any later 
DURKEN: Krola? 
CRUSHER: He was never in any real danger. The phaser was on stun. 
MIRASTA: Stun? 
PICARD: It's a defensive weapon. Have you been able to ascertain what
happened? 
CRUSHER: Based on the angle of impact, it suggests that Krola's left
hand was on the phaser when it went off, 
DURKEN: They were struggling for the weapon? 
CRUSHER: Commander Riker was in no position to offer any kind of
struggle, Chancellor. 
MIRASTA: Krola was trying to be a martyr? 
KROLA: Where is this? 
DURKEN: You're aboard the starship, my foolish old friend. 
KROLA: No. Chancellor, you must not. You must not pursue relations with
them. You must not. 
DURKEN: I know. I know.
