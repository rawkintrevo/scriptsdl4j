wants zal apology space series object revenge cloaked kaboom

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I am detecting an object five
thousand kilometres off our starboard bow. It is another probe. 
PICARD: Why didn't we detect it before? 
WORF: It must have been cloaked, sir. It came out of nowhere. 
PICARD: On screen. Is it another holographic device? 
DATA: I do not believe so, sir. 
WORF: Captain, the probe's systems are overloading. 
RIKER: Red alert. Shields up! 
(KaBOOM then a series of flashes) 
RIKER: Damage report. 
WORF: No damage, sir. 
DATA: Captain, I do not believe it was meant as an attack, but rather
as a message. 
PICARD: A message? 
DATA: Yes, sir, in B'zal, a Ferengi code which uses an alternating
pattern of light and darkness. 
PICARD: Can you translate it? 
DATA: I am attempting to do so. The message reads, my revenge is at
hand. 
PICARD: He's proved that he can get to us whenever he wants. Why
doesn't he do something?

[Ready room]

(Picard leaves his desk and goes to the replicator)

PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. 
(Bok is in his chair) 
BOK: If you want me to stay and talk, you'd better not call for
security this time. How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything
you'd always hoped for? 
PICARD: It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'll
be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? 
BOK: Oh, and how do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my
son. 
PICARD: It was self-defence. He fired on my ship. 
BOK: You were in Ferengi space! 
PICARD: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'm
sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. 
BOK: How touching. Your apology is worthless to me. I demand that you
repay me for my loss. 
PICARD: You cannot put a price on a life. 
BOK: Oh, but you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life. 
PICARD: No. 
BOK: You don't have any choice. I insist on being paid. 
(Bok beams out)
