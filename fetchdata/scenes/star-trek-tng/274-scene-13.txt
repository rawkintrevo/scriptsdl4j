[Holodeck - rock face]

(Jason is climbing without equipment) 
PICARD: (to security) Would you wait outside? 
(Rhodes and her companion leave, then Picard climbs to join Jason on a
ledge) 
GUEST1: Not bad. 
PICARD: I like climbing. There's something about actually having your
fate in your own hands. 
GUEST1: Yeah, I know. 
PICARD: It looks as though we may have found out how to locate Bok's
ship. This could all soon be over. 
GUEST1: You came all the way up here just to tell me that? 
PICARD: I thought it would make you feel better. 
GUEST1: Thanks. That was nice of you. 
PICARD: Jason, when your mother and I parted, I lost track of her
completely. But I would like to know more about what happened to her,
if you wouldn't mind telling me. 
GUEST1: Like what? 
PICARD: Well, how did you end up on Camor? It's an unlikely place for a
woman and child. 
GUEST1: Well, you know how she was. See a stray cat, take it in. See
somebody cold, give them your coat. 
PICARD: Yes, that was Miranda, all right. 
GUEST1: She heard about the all children on Camor who'd been orphaned
from the Cardassian war. 
PICARD: Oh. I see. 
GUEST1: I was only ten when we went there. I remember her telling me all
about the boys and girls who didn't have anybody to take care of them.
So she got this big house, practically falling apart, then she started
rounding up children. Eventually, there were over forty of us there.
She called it a school. You know, she got up before dawn every day and
went to bed well after midnight. In between she never stopped working.
She taught us all how to read. And she grew vegetables in hardpan to
feed us. And she made sure we knew how to sing. It's important in a
place like Camor. And then one day she was attacked by two men in the
street in broad daylight for the food she was carrying. If she'd just
given it to them, they probably wouldn't have hurt her. But she knew
how important the food was to us. So they killed her. 
PICARD: I'm so sorry. 
GUEST1: Don't be sorry for me. My mother made sure that we were all
tough enough to make it. 
PICARD: Jason, isn't there some way that I can be a father to you? My
own father and I were estranged. He wanted me to stay home and tend the
vineyards and I wanted to join Starfleet. And he died before we could
come to terms with that. And I've regretted that all of my life. I
don't want the same thing to happen to you and me. 
GUEST1: You don't understand. I'm not anybody you'd want for a son.
Trust me, if you knew anything about me, you wouldn't be trying so
hard. 
PICARD: You're so wrong. 
GUEST1: Oh, really? Let me spell it out for you. I've been in trouble
since I was a teenager. I lie, I steal, I use people. I'm a criminal.
That's what your son is. 
PICARD: I know. 
GUEST1: You do? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, I know all about your troubles with the Camor
authorities. 
GUEST1: You do. 
PICARD: It doesn't make any difference, Jason. You're still my son.
And, like it or not, I'm your father. I don't know what that means, but
it means something. There's some connection. 
GUEST1: Yeah. 
PICARD: But one thing is clear. You'll never look at your hairline
again in the same way.
