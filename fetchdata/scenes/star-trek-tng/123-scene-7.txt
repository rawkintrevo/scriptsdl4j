WESLEY: Unusual E-M burst, sir. Readings off scale.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise.
We're having difficulty getting a fix. 
TASHA: Have them go to their own transporter room. It will be tricky,
but perhaps I can link the two transporters in series
and get them over with the increased power. 
RIKER: It's worth a try. Captain T'Jon go to your transporter room.
Contact me from there. 
T'JON [OC]: Right, Enterprise. It's right next door. But if you can't
get us with your transporter, what makes you think ours will do the
job? 
TASHA: I'm going to interconnect them. 
T'JON [OC]: I didn't know you could do that. 
TASHA: Hurry! We're running out of time. 
T'JON [OC]: We're on our way. 
TASHA: I don't think they're going to make it. 
RIKER: Captain T'Jon doesn't sound like he cares one way or the other. 
TASHA: Worf, how much time do we have? 
WORF [OC]: One minute, twenty eight seconds. 
TASHA: Captain T'Jon, are you there? 
T'JON [OC]: We're in the transporter room. 
TASHA: Great. Activate your transporter. Set coordinates nine seven
zero three mark two six eight. 
T'JON [OC]: Did you say two eight six or eight eight six. 
TASHA: Mark two six eight! 
T'JON [OC]: Got it.
