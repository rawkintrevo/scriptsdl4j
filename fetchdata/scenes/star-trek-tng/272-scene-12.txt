PICARD RIKER WORF NECHEYEV

[Ready room]

PICARD: Admiral, the Indian Councils is adamant.
They refuse to leave Dorvan Five. NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Is there any
indication that the Tribal Council will change their position in the
near future? 
PICARD: No, sir. 
NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Then I see no other choice. 
PICARD: Admiral, I have every reason to believe that they will resist
any attempt to remove them. I strongly urge you to request an emergency
session of the Federation Council. The issue of Dorvan Five must be
reopened. 
NECHEYEV [on monitor]: Captain, I made that request two days ago. The
answer was no. I'm sorry but you have your orders. Starfleet out. 
RIKER: So much for your reprieve from Starfleet. 
PICARD: Anthwara believes that I am responsible for the crimes of one
of my ancestors against his people. 
RIKER: Do you believe that? 
PICARD: No, of course not. I respect his belief, but I do not see how
it can have any bearing on this mission. But even so, I can't help
wondering if a dark chapter in my family's history is about to be
repeated. If those people take up arms against us, then I cannot
foresee the consequences. Mister Worf, will you come in here for a
moment? 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
(Worf enters) 
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you begin preparations to remove the
inhabitants from Dorvan Five. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
