PICARD: Come. 
ODAN: You wanted to see me, Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, Ambassador. Please, sit down. We have entered orbit. We
shall be transporting you to the planet in a few minutes. 
ODAN: I am ready, Captain. 
PICARD: How will you proceed when you're there? 
ODAN: Oh, I cannot answer that. I never know until I am into the
situation, meet the people involved. I work very much by instinct, not
by pre-arranged plan. 
PICARD: It seems to work well for you. 
ODAN: Well, I do like to go into a situation as well-informed as
possible, and I must say that your staff has been quite helpful in
briefing me on the problems down here. Particularly Doctor Crusher. 
PICARD: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful. 
ODAN: Your Doctor Beverly is an extraordinary person, both as a
scientist and as a woman. 
PICARD: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to the
shuttlebay? 
ODAN: Captain, you know her better than I. Do you have any idea how
committed she is to remaining with Starfleet? 
PICARD: I wouldn't presume to speak for her. 
ODAN: Oh no, of course not. I just thought, well, you've known her so
much long than I. 
TAGGART [OC]: Ensign Taggart to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Ensign. 
TAGGART [OC]: The shuttle is ready to transport the Ambassador. 
PICARD: Very well. 
ODAN: I'll find my own way, Captain. I hope to return with good news.

[Shuttlebay]

LAFORGE: Commander Riker has asked to pilot you
himself, Ambassador. 
ODAN: I am honoured. 
(he embraces Beverly) 
ODAN: I don't know when I'll be back. 
CRUSHER: I know. Have a safe trip. 
ODAN: I will stay safe, Doctor Beverly. I have good reason to return.
I've researched Earth customs. This flower is given to express love. 
(a single red rose) 
CRUSHER: Yes, it is.
