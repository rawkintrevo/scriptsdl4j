LAFORGE PICARD WESLEY SINGH CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

(At a rear science station) 
PICARD: Obviously you feel it's something we should look at more
carefully. 
DATA: A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated,
sir. 
PICARD: I love a mystery, Data, but this one will have to to wait until
we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament. Time
and tide, Lieutenant La Forge. Go to warp eight. 
LAFORGE: Warp eight, sir. 
[Crusher's quarters]

WESLEY: Him Mom. You're back early. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
(She looks at the computer monitor he's studying) 
WESLEY: Physical sciences class. We're studying Doctor Channing's
theory on dilithium crystals. 
CRUSHER: Tell me about it. 
WESLEY: Really? You never seemed that interested in warp theory before.
Doctor Channing thinks it's possible to force dilithium into even more
useful crystals. If as shown here, matter and antimatter could be
aligned even more efficiently 
CRUSHER: Would that affect navigation? 
WESLEY: This is engineering, not helm control. 
CRUSHER: Oh yes, the helm's located on the Bridge. 
(Beverly leaves) 
WESLEY: Mom, is something wrong? 
[Bridge]

(Beverly tiptoes to Geordi's station) 
CRUSHER: This is the helm. 
LAFORGE: Unless there have been some changes I don't know about. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher? 
CRUSHER: You will wish to know Lieutenant Worf is much improved. Ready
to return to duty. 
PICARD: What was the diagnosis? 
CRUSHER: A temporary mental aberration. 
PICARD: Doctor, when such a diagnosis concerns a bridge officer, I
expect a better explanation. 
CRUSHER: Then I will first have to run some crosschecks on the library
computer. Klingons are so unusual in their reactions, aren't they? 
PICARD: Use Science Station two, Doctor. 
(That's next to where Data is working) 
DATA: Intriguing, Doctor. What does helm control have to do with
medical crosschecks? 
(Unseen by him, the blue energy leaves Beverly and enters the computer.
She is disoriented) 
CRUSHER: Why am I? 
DATA: Is something wrong, Doctor? 
PICARD: Doctor, are you all right? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Yes. I'll do my work in my office. That's where I should
be. 
PICARD: Do you want someone to accompany you? 
(Beverly shakes her head and enters the turbolift) 
DATA: Captain? There is a malfunction in this station. I cannot bring
any information up on it. Science two does not function either, sir. 
SINGH [OC]: Engineering to Captain Picard.
