[Transporter room]

PICARD: Is this part of the same pattern? 
LAFORGE: We don't know, sir. And we don't know why only transporter
room three is affected. None of the other transporter rooms are
malfunctioning. 
RIKER: Yet. 
PICARD: We reach Nahmi Four in twenty two hours. We'll want all
transporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic across
the board. 
RIKER: Advise Mister Barclay to join us on the Bridge immediately. 
LAFORGE: Could we make that fourteen hundred hours, sir? I've got him
working on something. 
RIKER: Fourteen hundred hours. Mister O'Brien, no maintenance on the
transporters until further notice. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.

[Troi's office]

TROI: I know this is difficult for you. Is there
anything I can do to make you more comfortable? 
BARCLAY: No. 
TROI: Have you ever been with a counsellor before? 
BARCLAY: Yes. No. 
TROI: Which one? 
BARCLAY: Yes, but she, it wasn't. It wasn't really a counsellor. 
TROI: Most people find a counsellor intimidating at first. It's okay if
you feel that way toward me. 
BARCLAY: Not at all. 
TROI: Good. Now, lean back, close your eyes. 
BARCLAY: Why? 
TROI: I want to make you more comfortable. 
BARCLAY: You do? 
TROI: Yes. 
(She dims the lights slightly and sits next to him) 
TROI: It's okay. Close your eyes. 
BARCLAY: What are you going to do? 
TROI: Just listen to the sound of my voice. Take a slow deep breath in
through your nose and let it out through your mouth just as slowly.
That's better, isn't it? 
BARCLAY: Much better. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, that's, that's much better.
That is extremely helpful. Thank you for your time. 
TROI: But 
BARCLAY: Really. That's very helpful. In through the nose, out through
the mouth. I'm going to practise that and I'll let you know. Thank you
again. 
(And he beats a rapid retreat)

[Bridge]

TROI: I had a very strange visit from one of your
officers today. 
LAFORGE: Barclay? Yes, I can imagine. Were you able to do anything for
him? 
TROI: To be honest, I'm not sure what happened. 
RIKER: Where is Mister Barclay? It's past fourteen hundred hours. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Barclay, report to the Bridge. Lieutenant Barclay,
report. 
RIKER: Computer. Locate Lieutenant Barclay. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay is in holodeck two. 
LAFORGE: I'll get him. 
RIKER: No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, you'd better come along.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: I think you should know Barclay's been
running some unique programs. 
RIKER: I don't care what he's been running. I just ran out of patience.
