[Observation lounge]

TOYA: What's happened to Alexandra and the other
children, Captain? How are you getting them back? 
CRUSHER: Toya, sit down. Don't give in to fear. Now, we all knew what
the risks were when we signed on, and that's the choice we made. Now,
Captain Picard will do everything possible to bring our children back. 
PICARD: The Aldeans are anxious to discuss compensation. 
BERNARD: Compensation? 
PICARD: That will buy us time. I've asked Doctor Crusher to be involved
in the negotiations as your representative. 
BERNARD: Why were these specific children taken? 
TROI: We can't be sure. We do know the Aldeans can't have children of
their own. 
BERNARD: Then they won't let them go easily. 
PICARD: I won't insult you by pretending that any of this will be easy.
But I can tell you that the Enterprise will not leave them behind. You
can be assured of that. 
BERNARD: Can we talk with our children? Give them some reassurance. Let
them know that we are here, and that they will be safe. 
PICARD: I'll do my best to arrange that. 
BERNARD: The last time I saw him, I yelled at him.

[Rashella's room]

RASHELLA: There you are! I have you now! 
(She and Alexandra are laughing and happy)

[First Unit]

(Two other couples are waiting) 
RADUE: Come in. Don't be alarmed. The other children have been assigned
to their units. 
WESLEY: Units? 
RADUE: A unit is a group where those of similar talents and interests
live together. 
WESLEY: Do you mean like a family. 
RADUE: Yes, you could call it that. 
WESLEY: We already have families. Does Captain Picard know you're doing
this? 
RADUE: We are keeping nothing from him. 
LEDA: We have been waiting for you so long, Harry. We are artists, just
like you. We see within you the potential of what you can be. 
HARRY: I'm not an artist. 
ACCOLAN: You will be. And a great one. 
LEDA: This way. (they step into an alcove) Unit B, three seven five. 
(and they vanish) 
RADUE: Katie. 
MELIAN: (an old man) I am honoured. 
KATIE: Thank you. 
RADUE: Melian is the foremost musician on Aldea. 
MELIAN: Music speaks its own language. I know we'll have much to learn
from each other. Don't worry, Katie, you'll be seeing Wesley soon. 
(Katie and Melian leave) 
WESLEY: What about me? Don't I get a say in this? 
RADUE: Wesley, sometimes something happens which you just must accept.
You and the other children are now members of this society. That will
not change. It is up to you to make the transition as easy as possible
for the others. It's your duty, because you are their leader. Help them
to accept it because nothing you, or those on the starship can do will
change it. Because like you, we also have no choice. 
(Alexandra and Rashella come running in, playing) 
RADUE: Where have you been Rashella? Zena and Aran are waiting to take
Alexandra. 
RASHELLA: No. 
RADUE: No? I told you that she 
RASHELLA: No, Radue. They can't have her. I will never let her go.
