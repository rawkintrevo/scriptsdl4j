GRAHAM: (the lady at helm) Entering the Tarchannen
system, sir. 
PICARD: Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf? 
WORF: Long range sensors holding on the shuttlecraft, bearing zero one
zero, mark two seven one. 
PICARD: Hail the vessel. 
WORF: Lieutenant Hickman does not respond, sir. 
PICARD: Put a repeating message on all subspace channels. Order the
Lieutenant to come about and stand to. Make it a priority one
communiqu. 
WORF: Still no response, sir. 
GRAHAM: The craft is now within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
DATA: The shuttle's acceleration is increasing. Its trajectory is
moving directly into the planet's atmosphere. He will reach an
atmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres.

RIKER: If he stays at that speed, he'll self-destruct. 
DATA: That is correct, Commander. 
PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? 
DATA: Fifty three seconds, sir. 
PICARD: Options? 
GRAHAM: He's out of transporter range. 
LAFORGE: He's still too far away to get a positive lock with the
tractor beam, Captain. 
PICARD: Open a channel. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. This is Captain Picard of
the Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach.

DATA: The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere, Captain. 
RIKER: He's panicking. 
DATA: At current rate of acceleration, the shuttle will be destroyed in
twenty eight seconds. 
DATA: Sixteen seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, you must do what I tell you. Reduce your
velocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees,
now. 
DATA: The shuttle's entering the lower ionosphere, sir. 
(bang) 
WORF: Captain, sensors detect two more Federation shuttlecraft on the
planet surface. No life signs. 
PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. 
RIKER: Worf, Data, Geordi. 
SUSANNA: I'd like to volunteer to join you, sir. 
RIKER: Commander.

[Tarchannen]

(the same location as the sensor logs. There is a
shuttlepod from 45167 on the surface, named Cousteau. The away team
beam in) 
RIKER: Commander Leijten, Geordi, check out the shuttle. Data, Worf,
you've got the perimeter. 
SUSANNA: It's the shuttlepod Mendez stole from the Aries. 
(Geordi checks the pod's systems while Suzanna wanders around. She
finds some three-toed tracks and follows them) 
DATA: No life signs, Commander. 
WORF: Sir, I am certain we are being watched. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker. Found it in the shuttle. (a uniform) Where's
Commander Leijten? 
RIKER: Riker to Susanna, report. Fan out. Let's find her. 
LAFORGE: Susanna! La Forge to Leijten. 
SUSANNA [OC]: Over here. 
(in among the bushes) 
LAFORGE: Where have you been? 
SUSANNA: Mendez and Brevelle are alive. You saw the footprints? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but they're not human. 
SUSANNA: They're here. Just stand still and listen. You can feel it.
They're here. 
LAFORGE: I'm not picking up anything. Wait a minute. Where are you
going? Susanna? 
SUSANNA: Stay away. 
LAFORGE: Suz? 
(He grabs her, she struggles) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Enterprise, medical emergency. Two to Sickbay.
