re-establish separation procedure immediately. 
COMPUTER: Orders regarding command functions are no longer accepted
from your present location. 
PICARD: And just what location are they accepted from? 
COMPUTER: Interface terminals on main Bridge only. 
WESLEY: You're the only one who has clearance to localise command

WORF: The isolinear subprocessor extends three point five metres. 
RIKER: I've got a clear path to panel J14 baker. What's that going to
do for us? 
WORF: J14 baker backs onto science station two, Commander. 
RIKER: Have they reinverted the environmental control sequencer? 
WORF: Yes, sir. Life support has been re-established. 
RIKER: Then you and Casey get up here. Let's get to it.
