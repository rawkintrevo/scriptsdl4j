[Ready room]

GUEST5: Yes, I was in charge of the force that
repelled the trespassers on Galen Four. I must say your Federation
troops fought tenaciously. 
PICARD: Among them Connor and Moira Rossa. 
GUEST5: I suppose. After the battle, I found this squalling child
huddled by the body of a young woman, his mother presumably. There was
almost no one left alive on Galen Four. Was I to leave him screaming by
his mother's body? 
PICARD: You should have notified the Federation authorities. To conceal
him was a clear violation of our agreement. 
GUEST5: I took him in accordance with my peoples' traditions. 
PICARD: What tradition is it that empowered you to capture a helpless
child? 
GUEST5: I lost my son at the hands of humans during the conflict over
Castal One. Talarian custom allows me to claim the son of a slain
enemy. 
PICARD: Does that custom extend also to brutalising this surrogate son?

GUEST5: What are you talking about? 
PICARD: Our medical officer discovered evidence of injuries so severe,
they might be considered torture. 
GUEST5: Nonsense. I've never harmed Jono. 
PICARD: Then explain the fractured ribs, concussion, the broken arm. 
GUEST5: Broken arm? Youth. Have you ever been a father, Picard? Have you
ever had a son desperately try to win your approval, your respect? Jono
broke his ribs riding on a t'stayan. Six hooves. A very powerful beast.
The arm, in a contest with other youths. He endured the pain and won
the competition. One day, he will be a great warrior. 
PICARD: Doesn't he deserve to become more than that? His true heritage
is human, Endar. 
GUEST5: A heritage long since forgotten. 
PICARD: While on board, you are welcome to supervise the return of your
crew, but I cannot allow Jeremiah Rossa to be returned to your custody.
His true family are waiting for him on Earth. 
GUEST5: Then under no circumstances will I allow your ship to leave our
territory. 
PICARD: I have already reported our position and the nature of this
violation to Starfleet. 
GUEST5: And I've already called for reserved forces into the sector. 
PICARD: Are you saying that you're willing to go to war over this boy? 
GUEST5: Would you not for your only son? 
PICARD: We have been at peace for many years. Let us not rush headlong
into war. 
GUEST5: Then help me to avoid it. If you will allow me to see Jono, it
will be clear to you I have been a good father. He has grown up happy
in my keeping.
