(it is a scene of death, devastation, fires and
controlled chaos) 
VOICES [OC]: All main thrusters are shut down. Your information is
unreliable. The AH is inoperative. Give me a hand here. 
(the team beam in) 
RIKER: We're from the Federation Starship Enterprise. We received your
distress call. 
MIROK: The Enterprise? 
RIKER: That's right. Your message said you'd suffered a failure in your
engine core. 
MIROK: Yes. We had a forced chamber explosion in the resonator coil. 
LAFORGE: It's a pretty strange set up, but it looks like the graviton
field generator has been completely depolarised. There's no way to fix
it. It'll have to be replaced. 
RIKER: Where are your replicators? 
VAREL: (a woman) They are offline. 
RIKER: Who's in charge here? 
MIROK: The Captain is dead. I'm the science officer. Mirok. 
RIKER: We'd like to move the generator back to the Enterprise for
replication. 
MIROK: All right. 
RIKER: Geordi, you and Ro. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Brossmer. Two people and one piece of equipment to
beam aboard. 
[Transporter room]

BROSSMER: Aye, sir. 
(She activates the controls and things fizzle) 
BROSSMER: What the hell? Engineering, I need more power to the primary
energising coil. Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm losing them I have to
abort. 
[Romulan Engineering]

BROSSMER [OC]: They should be returning to your
coordinates, sir. 
RIKER: Chief, do you have them? They're not here. 
BROSSMER [OC]: No, sir. 
RIKER: Where are they?
