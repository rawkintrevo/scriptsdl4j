[Bridge]

RIKER: We've received word from Ambassador Mauric.
He's ready to see you and Doctor Crusher. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Inform him we're on our way. Thank you for
breakfast. 
CRUSHER: Wait until tomorrow. I have something very special planned.
It's a Vulcan dish. That's all I'll say.

[Transporter room]

WORF: Captain. Doctor. I have the coordinates of
Ambassador Mauric's chambers. 
PICARD: Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Enterprise to Kes Security Relay Station One. We're ready to
commence transport. 
KES [OC]: Acknowledged, Enterprise. We have lowered our defense shield.

WORF: Confirmed. 
PICARD: Energise. 
(Picard and Crusher are beamed away, and Worf starts to leave) 
KES [OC]: This is Security Relay Station One. We are ready to receive
your Captain and Medical Officer. 
WORF: This is the Enterprise. We have completed the transport sequence.
You should have them. 
KES [OC]: Negative, Enterprise. They are not here.

(Picard wakes up on a hard floor) 
PICARD: Beverly. Beverly. 
CRUSHER: What happened? 
PICARD: I don't know. 
CRUSHER: The last thing I remember we were beginning to transport. 
PICARD: I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind of
prison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that Ambassador
Mauric would have any reason to detain us. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: Let me see. 
PICARD: What? 
(there's something sticking out of the back of his neck) 
CRUSHER: It looks like an implant. It seems to be connected directly to
the brainstem. 
(She's got one under her hair as well) 
PICARD: Some kind of coercive device? 
CRUSHER: Whatever it is I doubt it's designed for our health. 
(the doors open and security in dark one-piece suits with hoods enter) 
PICARD: What is going on here? 
CRUSHER: If you tell us why you've taken us hostage, we might be able
to 
LORIN: (female) You are not hostages. You are prisoners. 
PICARD: Prisoners on whose authority? 
LORIN: You are being held under the authority of the Prytt Security
Ministry. The charges are conspiring with the enemy. 
PICARD: Enemy? You mean the Kes. 
LORIN: We're not fools. We are aware of the Federation attempt to
establish a military alliance with the Kes. It will not be tolerated. 
PICARD: Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter into
any 
LORIN: There is no point in trying to mislead us, Captain. The devices
which have been implanted in your cerebral cortexes will soon be
calibrated to your psi-wave pattern. At that time, we will be able to
get all the information we need. 
PICARD: And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth. 
LORIN: We shall see.
