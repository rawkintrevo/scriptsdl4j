[Shuttlecraft]

(The Sahkarov is lined up with the bay doors) 
WESLEY: Shuttle number two is ready for departure. 
DATA [OC]: The Enterprise is at impulse speed. You are cleared for take
off. 
(Picard is clearly an advocate of the old adage of not keeping a dog
and barking yourself. Wesley flies the shuttle out) 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Data, wasn't the Captain looking forward to
this mission to the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster? 
DATA: So he said. 
RIKER: Then what would make him change his mind? Why would he leave the
ship now? 
WORF: Commander, receiving a mayday on all frequencies. 
RIKER: Source? 
WORF: Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero zero six 
RIKER: Detail? 
WORF: Ship. Unidentified. Distress. Nothing more. 
RIKER: Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar zero zero six, warp seven. 
DATA: Sir, Rhomboid Dronegar sector would put us at considerable
distance from Captain Picard. 
RIKER: I know, Data. I know. 
(later) 
DATA: Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector zero zero six. 
WORF: I have a ship on target path. 
RIKER: Slow to impulse speed. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Viewer. 
WORF: Deploy shields, sir? 
RIKER: Hold fast. Data? 
DATA: Basic early design. Capable of sub-light travel only. 
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed. 
RIKER: On screen. 
RIKER: I am First Officer William Riker of the USS Enterprise. We're
responding to your distress signal. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: (not looking at the screen, grunts his
acknowledgement) 
RIKER: What is your problem? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We are far from home. 
(The bushy eyebrows rise at forty five degrees towards the middle of
the forehead, creating a sad look) 
RIKER: Aren't we all. But you sent out a Mayday? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: (grunt) 
RIKER: Do you need help? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We are Pakleds. Our ship is the Mondor. It
is broken. 
(La Forge enters) 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We are far from home. We need help. 
LAFORGE: Let me guess. Their rubber band broke, right? 
DATA: Sensors indicate engineering problems. They're experiencing total
guidance system failure, with less than twenty four hours' reserve
power. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I can help. 
RIKER: What brings you so far from home? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We look for things. 
RIKER: What were you looking for? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Things we need. 
RIKER: Can you be more specific? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Things that make us go. We need help. 
RIKER: What is the nature of your mission? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We look for things. 
RIKER: Did you hear an echo? 
LAFORGE: Commander, from the looks of their ship, I could have them up
and running in no time. 
RIKER: You sure? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, no problem. 
RIKER: Very well. Our Chief Engineer will beam over to help you. Close.

WORF: Commander? Do we truly need to send our Chief Engineer over to
them? 
RIKER: Obviously they need our help. 
WORF: Why do we not simply give them the information they need to make
their own repairs? 
RIKER: Do you honestly get the impression they could handle our
technical specifications? 
WORF: We do not know anything about them. 
RIKER: Acknowledged, Mister Worf. We have an obligation to render aid.
Report to the transporter Room with all necessary gear. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(Geordi leaves) 
WORF: We need more information. 
RIKER: Do you have anything else on them? 
DATA: They are a relatively benign species. 
RIKER: Don't they seem a little slow? 
DATA: They may merely have poorly developed language skills. 
WORF: What about weapons? 
DATA: Scanners shows limited armaments. 
RIKER: I think we can relax, Mister Worf. They can't even move their
ship without our help. We certainly have them outmanned and outgunned. 
[Shuttlecraft]

WESLEY: ETA thirteen thirty hours, sir. It's not
exactly warp speed. 
PICARD: More like a late twenty-second century interplanetary journey. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: You should read more history, Ensign. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Complete waste of time. 
WESLEY: Pardon? 
PICARD: I shouldn't be taking this trip at all. I should be back on
board the Enterprise. 
WESLEY: Why are you coming with me to Starbase Five One Five, sir? 
PICARD: Well, it's certainly not my idea. I'm sorry, Ensign, I didn't
mean to take it out on you. I just hate the prospect of another damned
cardiac replacement. 
WESLEY: Cardiac replacement? I didn't know. 
PICARD: Well, now you do. 
WESLEY: A parthenogenetic implant? 
PICARD: What else would it be? My heart was injured and a replacement
was necessary. That would have been it, except that the replacement is
faulty. 
WESLEY: Why would anyone use a faulty replacement? 
PICARD: Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.
