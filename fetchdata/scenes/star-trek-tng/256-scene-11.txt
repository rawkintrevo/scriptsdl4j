RIKER GIUSTI DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Ruins]

(what looks like a Romulan woman runs forward and
grabs the artefacts) 
RIKER: (to security woman) I'm going to head for those trees over
there. If I can get there, we might be able to set up a crossfire. 
(Riker makes it to some rocks and gets knocked out by a blast. The
mercenaries get him and beam away) 
DATA [OC]: Data to away team. Please respond. 
LAFORGE: Data, we've been attacked.

[Bridge] 
LAFORGE [OC]: We've got one casualty and Commander
Riker has been taken captive. 
[Ruins]

WORF: Sir, the mercenaries have beamed away. They
must have a base or a ship nearby. Can the sensors locate anything?

[Bridge]

GIUSTI: Commander, we're picking up a vessel
leaving orbit. 
DATA: Why was it not detected earlier? 
GIUSTI: They could have been using the planet as a shield. Sir, they
are powering up their weapon systems. 
DATA: Raise shields. Red alert. 
(the little ship strafes the Enterprise as it passes) 
DATA: Damage report. 
GIUSTI: Minor hit on the port deflector. No damage. They're running,
sir. Their speed is warp eight point seven and holding. I think they're
at their maximum. 
DATA: Take us to warp nine and pursue. Lock phasers on target. 
GIUSTI: Sir, we should be within phaser range in twenty three seconds.
Switching to long-range scanners. Commander, the sensor image of that
ship is extremely weak. It's fading. The ship doesn't register on the
long-range sensors. I'm sorry, sir. We've lost them. 
DATA: Increase the sensor field bandwidth. Patch in the lateral sensor
arrays. 
GIUSTI: It's no good, the signal's gone. It just disappeared. 
DATA: Plot a course and take us back to Barradas Three. Notify the away
team to prepare for transport. 
GIUSTI: Aye, sir.
