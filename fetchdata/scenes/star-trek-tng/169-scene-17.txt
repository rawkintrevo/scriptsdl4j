[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I need you in transporter room three,
Commander. 
[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: On my way, Chief. Listen, Reg. I really do
want you to talk to Counselor Troi. 
BARCLAY: Troi? No, no, no, no, no. I couldn't. 
LAFORGE: I mean it. As your friend and as your commanding officer.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I was synchronising the phase transition
coils, I didn't do anything I haven't done a hundred times before. The
test object is made of pure duranium. 
LAFORGE: Seems normal enough to me. 
O'BRIEN: Watch this. 
(He beams the test cylinder from one side of the pads to the other and
back again. It ends up in two pieces, and steaming gently) 
LAFORGE: I'm glad I don't have anywhere to go.

Chief Engineer's log, stardate 43808.2. A systems
analysis of transporter room three has yielded no suggestion of a cause
for the latest malfunction aboard the Enterprise.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Is this part of the same pattern? 
LAFORGE: We don't know, sir. And we don't know why only transporter
room three is affected. None of the other transporter rooms are
malfunctioning. 
RIKER: Yet. 
PICARD: We reach Nahmi Four in twenty two hours. We'll want all
transporters operational by then. I want a level one diagnostic across
the board. 
RIKER: Advise Mister Barclay to join us on the Bridge immediately. 
LAFORGE: Could we make that fourteen hundred hours, sir? I've got him
working on something. 
RIKER: Fourteen hundred hours. Mister O'Brien, no maintenance on the
transporters until further notice. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.
