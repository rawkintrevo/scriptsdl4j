[Jovis Cargo bay]

DATA: Perhaps I should attempt to communicate with
the Enterprise. 
GUEST0: You can't. Fajo has communications access restricted to the
bridge. Once we're out, the shuttlepod will emit an emergency beacon.
We'll just have to hope somebody responds before Fajo is able to
destroy us. 
DATA: I am trained in evasive manoeuvres. 
GUEST0: We'll need a few. Let's get going. As soon as I start the
escape sequence, an alarm will sound. We won't have much time. 
(Data gets in the pod, Varria goes to a control station and presses
buttons. The alarm sounds, a man runs in. She points the disrupter at
him, then is jumped from behind by another crewman and disarmed. Man
number one cancels the sequence while Data rescues Varria. Data ends up
throwing both men across the bay. They go to start again, when Fajo
enters. The disrupter is lying on the floor. Varria dives for it but
lands short. Fajo aims another disrupter at her. For a moment, he
starts to turn away, then fires. Varria screams for several seconds
before she finally disintegrates. Data comes out of the pod) 
GUEST1: It's your fault. You knew the price for disobedience. And so did
she. Well, there's always another Varria. 
(Data picks up the disrupter and points it at Fajo) 
GUEST1: You won't hurt me. Fundamental respect for all living beings.
That is what you said. I'm a living being, therefore you can't harm me.

DATA: You will surrender yourself to the authorities. 
GUEST1: Or what? You'll fire? Empty threat and we both know it. Why don't
you accept your fate? You will return to your chair and you will sit
there. You will entertain me and you will entertain my guests. And if
you do not, I will simply kill somebody else. Him, perhaps. It doesn't
matter. Their blood will be on your hands too, just like poor Varria's.
Your only alternative, Data, is to fire. Murder me. That's all you have
to do. Go ahead. Fire. If only you could feel rage over Varria's death.
If only you could feel the need for revenge, then maybe you could fire.
But you're just an android. You can't feel anything, can you? It's just
another interesting intellectual puzzle for you. Another of life's
curiosities. 
DATA: I cannot permit this to continue. 
(He levels the disrupter at Fajo again) 
GUEST1: Wait. Your programme won't allow you to fire. You cannot fire.
No. 
(A transporter beam takes hold of Data)
