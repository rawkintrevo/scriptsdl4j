RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD OGAWA CRUSHER DATA

[Somebody's quarters]

RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the
deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. 
WORF: I hope (pause) so. 
RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I am experiencing nIb'poH, the feeling I have done this before. 
RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. 
WORF: That's not what I mean. 
CRUSHER: I've been having the same feeling. Keep dealing, Data. 
DATA: Eight. Ace. 
CRUSHER: A Queen. You're going to give me a Queen. And you're going to
get a four. Deal, Data. 
DATA: But no one has bet. 
CRUSHER: Forget the bet. Just deal. Ten, seven, queen. 
WORF: Nine. Jack. Four. 
RIKER: Deuce. Six. 
DATA: This is highly improbable. 
RIKER: How did we know? 
CRUSHER: Wait. Crusher to Sickbay. 
[Sickbay]

OGAWA: Sickbay here. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Is Commander La Forge there? 
OGAWA: No, Doctor, he's not. Wait a minute. He just came in.
(After Geordi's examination) 
PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Captain, have you been getting the feeling that you've
experienced certain things before? A sense of repetition? 
PICARD: Yes, recently. While I was reading. Why do you ask? 
CRUSHER: There have been similar incidents reported all over the ship.
Feelings of
dj vu. I had a premonition Geordi was going to come in to Sickbay. A
few seconds later he did, with the symptoms of an ear infection. I was
going to run the standard tests, but somehow I had a feeling they would
turn out negative. So I ran an optical diagnostic which traced the
problem to Geordi's visor. His dizziness is being caused by a phase
shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see images that
aren't there. 
LAFORGE: They're like blurry after-images. 
CRUSHER: I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he was seeing. I
picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field.
Somehow, his visor is translating those distortions into visual
impulses. 
LAFORGE: It could be a malfunction in the ship's warp field generator.
I'll check it out. 
PICARD: Run a localised subspace scan to look for anything else. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(Geordi leaves) 
PICARD: Keep me advised.
