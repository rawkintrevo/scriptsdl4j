TOKATH WORF

[Worf's room]

(Worf is doing something to a piece of equipment
when there is a knock on the door) 
WORF: Enter. 
(a Romulan comes in) 
TOKATH: I am Tokath. I can return later if I am disturbing you? 
WORF: It is a strange thing when a jailer concerns himself with his
prisoner's comfort. 
TOKATH: Mine is a strange prison. 
WORF: You robbed the Klingons of who they were. You dishonoured them. 
TOKATH: By not slitting their throats when we found them unconscious? 
WORF: I do not expect you to understand. You are a Romulan. 
TOKATH: You're just like L'Kor was twenty years ago. Proud and angry.
He hated me. All the Klingons did. And I had no love for them, I won't
deny it. When I informed the High Command that the Klingons wanted to
remain here, I was told that unless I stayed to oversee them myself,
they would be killed. My decision ended my military career. 
WORF: Why did you do it? 
TOKATH: I don't expect you to understand. You're a Klingon. But I do
expect you to understand this, We've put aside the old hatreds. Here,
Romulans and Klingons live in peace. I won't allow you to destroy what
we have. 
WORF: Do not deceive yourself. These people are not happy here. I see
the sadness in their eyes. 
TOKATH: That's not what I see when I look in my wife's eyes. I married
a Klingon. So you see, when I warn you not to disrupt our lives here
I'm not speaking just as a jailer, but as a man protecting his family.
Do not test my tolerance.
