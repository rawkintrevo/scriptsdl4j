TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI DATA

[Shuttlebay two]

(Guy Vardeman is on duty here) 
DATA [OC]: Engage secondary tractor beam. 
(The external beam is swapped for an internal one to bring the shuttle
in to land. The markings say NCC-1701-D 05 El Baz. Riker and Worf
enter) 
RIKER: It's a Federation shuttlecraft, all right. 
WORF: Yet there are no Federation bases or vessels in this area. 
RIKER: NCC one seven zero one D USS Enterprise, shuttlecraft five. 
(They look over to a shuttlecraft already parked in the bay. Pulaski
and a medic enter) 
RIKER: NCC one seven zero one D USS Enterprise shuttlecraft five. 
WORF: How is this possible? 
PULASKI: Commander, come here! 
(They gaze at the unconscious pilot of the new shuttlecraft - Jean-Luc
Picard) 
RIKER: Captain? 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Number One. 
RIKER: Are you on the Bridge? 
PICARD [OC]: Where else would I be? 
RIKER: Well. right now I think you should be in Shuttlebay two. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Why? What is it? 
RIKER: This I think you should see for yourself. Bring Commander Data. 
[Shuttlebay two]

(Picard, Data and Troi enter) 
PICARD: Condition? 
PULASKI: The life signs are very confusing. His heartbeat is strong,
but the pulse is off. 
PICARD: Is he injured? 
PULASKI: There's no signs of trauma. 
PICARD: Why is he unconscious? What happened to him? 
PULASKI: I can't say. The readings of his brain waves are very strange.

PICARD: Strange? In what way? Non-human? Artificial? 
PULASKI: No, neither. They're just out of phase. 
PICARD: Can you revive him? 
PULASKI: I wouldn't even attempt it till we get him into Sickbay. Come
on, let's get him back. 
(The second Picard is wheeled away) 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: I have never felt anything quite like this before, so it's
difficult to put into words. That person is you. 
PICARD: No. 
TROI: He is as much Jean-Luc Picard as the person I am standing next
to. Beyond that, there is very little I can be sure of. I will have to
wait until he regains consciousness before knowing more. 
PICARD: Data, I need to know what's on the shuttle's logs. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Data gets into the shuttlecraft) 
DATA: Captain, both primary and reserve power has been drained from the
shuttle. I am going to have to connect to the Enterprise in order to
activate the shuttle's systems. 
RIKER: Geordi 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Report to Shuttlebay two immediately. 
LAFORGE: I'm on my way.
