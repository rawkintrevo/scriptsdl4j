(Picard is in dress uniform, showing off his
calves) 
PICARD: I thought you might find this interesting, Mister Crusher. Few
humans have ever seen an Antedean in the flesh. 
(Two aliens and a barrel are beamed aboard) 
PICARD: Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. 
WESLEY: Are they alright, Captain? 
PICARD: Yes. This is their preferred way of space travel. 
PULASKI: Their physical condition is good enough, considering the
circumstances. 
PICARD: It is a self-induced catatonic state. Their way of dealing with
the trauma of spaceflight. 
WESLEY: Will we try to revive them? 
PICARD: No, not until we reach the Pacifica conference, three days from
now. Doctor, have you prepared a Sickbay facility to
accommodate our guests? 
PULASKI: As soon as I can make some adjustments. Their physiology is
unusual. You can store them for a few hours? 
O'BRIEN: Sure. I'll have them kept out of the way here. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, provide security. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Picard leaves) 
WESLEY: What's in that container? 
PULASKI: Vermicula. It's their food. When they come out of stasis,
they'll be very hungry. 
(live fish-like things) 
WESLEY: They eat this? 
PULASKI: In great quantities. 
WORF: What a handsome race.
