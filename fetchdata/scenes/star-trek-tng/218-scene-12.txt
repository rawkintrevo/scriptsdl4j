[Bridge]

PICARD: Report. 
RO: Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon until we were almost on top of
it, sir. 
WORF: It is a highly localised distortion of the space-time continuum. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(the blue swirly, as before) 
PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. 
RO: Aye sir. Captain, manoeuvreing thrusters are not responding. 
DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. 
LAFORGE: All main systems just went down. Power levels are dropping
rapidly. 
RIKER: Red alert. 
DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. 
TROI: We have to get out of here now. 
DATA: Captain, something is emerging. 
(here comes the ship again) 
RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. 
WORF: Shields inoperative. 
RO: The helm is not responding. 
DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty six
seconds. 
PICARD: Hail them. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Suggestions? 
RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow us
out of the way. 
DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the other
ship's trajectory. 
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Engaging tractor beam. 
(thump) 
RIKER: Damage report! 
CRUSHER: Casualty reports coming in from all over the ship. 
DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are venting
drive plasma. 
LAFORGE: Initiating emergency core shutdown. 
RO: Inertial dampers failing. We're losing attitude control. 
RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. 
DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter
containment. 
LAFORGE: We've got to eject the core! 
DATA: Ejector systems are offline. Core breach is imminent 
PICARD: (to comm.) All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon 
(KaBOOM!!!!)

Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise has
entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first
Starfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region.

[Somebody's quarters]

RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the
deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. 
WORF: I hope (pause) so. 
RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I am experiencing nIb'poH, the feeling I have done this before. 
RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. 
WORF: That's not what I mean. 
CRUSHER: I've been having the same feeling. Keep dealing, Data. 
DATA: Eight. Ace. 
CRUSHER: A Queen. You're going to give me a Queen. And you're going to
get a four. Deal, Data. 
DATA: But no one has bet. 
CRUSHER: Forget the bet. Just deal. Ten, seven, queen. 
WORF: Nine. Jack. Four. 
RIKER: Deuce. Six. 
DATA: This is highly improbable. 
RIKER: How did we know? 
CRUSHER: Wait. Crusher to Sickbay.
