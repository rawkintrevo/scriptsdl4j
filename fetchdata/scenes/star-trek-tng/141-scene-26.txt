RIKER: O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see any of
this. You're not involved. 
O'BRIEN: Right, sir. I'll just standing over here, dozing off. 
RIKER: Data, you've got ten minutes. That's it. If you meet anybody but
Sarjenka 
DATA: I will signal for immediate beam out. 
(Data is beamed down) 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker to the Bridge. 
RIKER: Damn. 
O'BRIEN: I just woke up, sir. 
RIKER: You know what to do? 
O'BRIEN: No problem, sir. I'll have him out of there as smooth as ice.

[Sarjenka's house]

(Constructed mainly of hexagons. There is a toy
doll on a bed of pillows. He finds the radio. The door is a forcefield
or hologram. Data touches it, it vanishes to reveal a red and sullen
outside, lit by erupting volcanoes. The ground shakes so he goes back
inside and closes the door. After a moment, a little girl runs in and
goes straight over to the radio. She has orange skin and hair, and all
her fingers are the same length) 
DATA: Sarjenka? Wait! I'm Data. 
SARJENKA: Data. Data, you came. Data, where have you been? 
DATA: It would take too long to explain. You and your family must
leave. 
SARJENKA: We already have. We ran when the tremors began. 
DATA: Then why are you here? 
SARJENKA: My father wouldn't let us take anything, but I had to have my
transmitter. I knew you would come back, and I didn't want you to find
only silence, the way I did. 
DATA: I am sorry for that, but it is very complicated. Does your family
know where you are? 
SARJENKA: No. 
DATA: You cannot survive in this. 
SARJENKA: What are we going to do? 
DATA: Enterprise, two to beam up. You must come with me. 
SARJENKA: Where are we going? (Data points upwards) To the stars? 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: There's going to be hell to pay. 
DATA: Where is Commander Riker? 
O'BRIEN: On the Bridge. Where are you going? 
DATA: To the Bridge. 
O'BRIEN: And you're going to take that? 
SARJENKA: Don't leave me here. Please don't leave me. 
DATA: Quite impossible.

[Bridge]

(Picard is pacing back and forth) 
WORF: Sir, three minutes to resonator launch. 
PICARD: Where is he? 
RIKER: He'll be here. 
(Data and Sarjenka enter) 
PICARD: He has brought a child onto my ship and on my Bridge. 
RIKER: I'm sure Mister Data has a very good explanation. 
DATA: I do, sir. She was frightened and did not wish to be left alone 
PICARD: Mister Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will you
escort her to Sickbay. 
SARJENKA: No, Data, no. I'm scared. Don't make me go. 
TROI: It's all right, no one's going to hurt you. 
SARJENKA: No! 
TROI: We'll just go and get a treat, and then 
SARJENKA: No.
DATA: Captain, I will see to it that she is not in the way. 
WORF: One minute to launch. 
TROI: Come on, it'll be all right. 
SARJENKA: No. Just leave me alone. I want Data. 
DATA: Counsellor, allow me. Please. Sarjenka, no one will harm you.
These are my friends. 
PICARD: Mister Data, take your station and keep her with you. This does
concern her. 
WORF: Ten seconds. 
DATA: I will require my hand. Thank you. 
WORF: Firing torpedoes. 
(Four balls of red light streak away) 
DATA: Sensors locked on probes. 
WORF: Torpedoes have reached their targets. 
DATA: Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun. 
SARJENKA: What are you doing? 
DATA: We are attempting to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there will
be no more quakes, no more
volcanoes. 
PICARD: Ensign, when should the results be known? 
WESLEY: They should happen very quickly, sir. 
SARJENKA: And my parents and brothers? 
DATA: Captain, sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonic
stress levels. 
WESLEY: It worked. We did it. 
DATA: Your parents will be safe now. 
SARJENKA: You did this for me? 
DATA: Look, Sarjenka, there is your home.
PICARD: Data, escort her to Sickbay. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge.
