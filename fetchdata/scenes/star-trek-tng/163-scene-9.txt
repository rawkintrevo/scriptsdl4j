RIKER TASHA PICARD GARRETT GUINAN CASTILLO CREWWOMAN CRUSHER

[Ready room]

PICARD: You must have some idea how things have
changed. 
GUINAN: I look at things, I look at people, and they just don't feel
right. 
PICARD: What things? What people? 
GUINAN: You. Your uniform. The Bridge. 
PICARD: What's the matter with the Bridge? 
GUINAN: It's not right. 
PICARD: It's the same Bridge. Nothing has changed. 
GUINAN: I know that. I also know it's wrong. 
PICARD: What else? 
GUINAN: Families. There should be children on this ship. 
PICARD: What? Children on the Enterprise? Guinan, we're at war. 
GUINAN: No, we're not. At least, we're not supposed to be. This is not
a ship of war. This a ship of peace. 
PICARD: What you're suggesting 
GUINAN: I'm not suggesting. That ship from the past is not supposed to
be here. It's got to go back.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Run a full electrolyte report. Boost the
level of tricordrazine. Try to relax. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Doctor Selar, report to pathology ward stat. Doctor
Selar, report to pathology ward stat. 
PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard. 
GARRETT: Rachel Garrett. How's my ship? 
PICARD: The support systems are being restored. We're continuing
repairs. 
GARRETT: Where did you come from? We weren't picking up any other
Federation ships in this sector. 
PICARD: What's the last thing you remember? 
GARRETT: We were answering the distress signal. 
PICARD: Distress signal? 
GARRETT: You must have heard it. From the Klingon outpost, Narendra
Three. But you didn't, did you? This Sickbay, I've never seen like it,
even on a starbase. And your uniform. What ship is this, Captain? 
CRUSHER: Please try to be still. 
GARRETT: I must insist. What ship? 
PICARD: You are aboard the Enterprise, Captain. One seven oh one D. You
have come twenty two years into the future. 
GARRETT: Twenty two years. Does my crew know yet? 
PICARD: No. 
GARRETT: I must tell them. I owe them that. 
PICARD: If you wish, I can see that they're informed. 
GARRETT: Is there some reason they should not be told? 
PICARD: I am concerned that if you return to your own time with
knowledge of the future 
GARRETT: Return to the battle? We barely escaped with our lives. If we
returned, we'd be destroyed. 
PICARD: Have you any idea how this happened? 
GARRETT: There was a fierce volley of photon torpedoes. We were hit. A
bright light, and then here. 
PICARD: It is possible that this exchange of fire was the catalyst for
the formation of a temporal rift. History has no record of your battle
with the Romulans. 
GARRETT: We were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost
on Narendra Three. The Romulans were attacking it. We engaged them, but
there were four warbirds. 
PICARD: The Narendra Three outpost was destroyed. It is regrettable
that you did not succeed. A Federation starship rescuing a Klingon
outpost might have averted twenty years of war.

[1701C Bridge]

CASTILLO: I just can't quite make myself believe
it. Twenty two years! 
TASHA: I'm reading forty percent on forward shields. What do you have
on aft? 
CASTILLO: Forty percent. 
TASHA: That won't cut it. Commander, advise Lieutenant La Forge that
shields are below minimum. 
RIKER: Acknowledged. 
CASTILLO: We'll never see our homes again. Our families. 
TASHA: How do you know your family's not still alive? 
CASTILLO: You're right, I don't. But imagine coming home after
twenty-two years. Would I even recognise them? 
TASHA: What are the stats on main phaser banks? 
CASTILLO: Emitters available, sixty percent forward, fifty two percent
aft. 
TASHA: Good. Let's take a look at the torpedo launchers. 
CASTILLO: I guess I'm lucky to be alive at all. 
TASHA: You may not like the future. It's been a long war. The
Federation has lost more than half of Starfleet to the Klingons. 
CASTILLO: We were negotiating a peace treaty when I left. 
TASHA: A lot of changes, Lieutenant. A lot of changes. 
CASTILLO: When we get a break, maybe you could fill me in on some of
them. 
TASHA: Photon banks are depleted. Auxiliary fusion generators are down.
