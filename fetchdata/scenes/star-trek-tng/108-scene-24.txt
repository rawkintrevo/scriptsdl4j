console delays peace corrected alert continue concern killed engineer

[Engineering]

(Singh taps at a console, then the blue energy zaps
into his body and throws him onto the floor. Worf finds him) 
WORF: Engineering to Captain Picard. Security alert. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard. 
WORF: Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found Mister Singh. He's dead.

Captain's log, stardate 41249.4. I've ordered an
immediate investigation into the death of Assistant Chief Engineer
Singh. We continue to run on impulse power.

[Engineer's office]

WESLEY: He could have been working there, restoring
warp power. 
LAFORGE: According to these readings, we could go back to warp speed
now. 
WESLEY: Those aren't the same readings as when I left. 
WORF: Singh probably repaired it just before he was killed. 
WESLEY: He couldn't have repaired, sir. The problems were inside the
engine. 
LAFORGE: Who else could have corrected it, Wes? Inform the bridge of
engine status. 
WORF: Engineering to Bridge. We now have warp capacity, sir. All power
on line.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Well done. Warp engines ready on previous
heading. Warp factor six.

[Antican quarters]

ANTICAN: I tolerate these questions, Lieutenant
Yar, because I need this vessel to get us to Parliament. Your shipboard
problems do not concern me. 
TASHA: They should. Our delays are your delays. 
ANTICAN: The peace conference will wait for us. 
TASHA: I must ask where you were during this vessel's Earth hours of
eighteen hundred last night and zero seven hundred this morning. 
ANTICAN: Eating. 
TASHA: Sir, we're talking about hours here. 
ANTICAN: It was a large meal, Lieutenant Yar. And a very interesting
animal.
