[Ten Forward]

(Rabal is at a table, staring at the rift) 
RABAL: Commander. 
LAFORGE: May I join you? 
(Rabal nods) 
LAFORGE: I wanted to say I'm sorry about your sister. 
RABAL: Thank you. I'm trying to tell myself that she died for what she
believed in, but somehow that isn't much comfort. 
LAFORGE: I wish it could have happened differently. Maybe I should have
looked at the research more closely. It's possible there's something
that I missed. 
RABAL: No. You didn't miss anything. The problem was time. We needed
more time to do the proper research. Serova wasn't willing to wait. 
LAFORGE: No. I guess the question is now, where do we go from here? 
RABAL: I don't think we can look at space travel the same way anymore.
We're going to have to change. 
LAFORGE: I've been in Starfleet for a long time. We depend on warp
drive. I just don't know how easy it's going to be to change. 
RABAL: It won't be easy at all.

DATA: Captain, warp pulse calculations are
complete. We will be firing the engines at maximum intensity for six
point three seconds before disengaging. 
WORF: Damage control teams are standing by on all decks. 
RIKER: The course to the Fleming is plotted and laid in, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, whenever you're ready. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Initiating warp pulse now.
