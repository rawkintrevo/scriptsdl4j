(The light pops up through the floor, hides from
them follow a couple of crew, and goes up into crew quarters. It seems
to examine one man asleep, then passes through a bulkhead, goes

Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been an
outbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. We
are on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague and
transport them to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully an
antidote can be produced.
