[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, the final manifest has been
received. 
PICARD: At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want you both to be
completely familiar with it. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

TROI: Data, will you help me get to Sickbay.

[Pulaski's office]

TROI: It's time. 
PULASKI: Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you to Maternity. 
DATA: Worf, assemble your security team in Sickbay. 
PULASKI: Is that necessary? 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. 
PULASKI: Well, it's strange to need armed guards in a delivery room.
This way. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: How frequent are your contractions? 
TROI: Very close together. 
PULASKI: In my other deliveries, except for a couple, the father was
always present. 
TROI: Difficult under the circumstances. 
DATA: Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. 
PULASKI: Counsellor Troi is going to need the comfort of a human touch,
not the cold hand of technology. 
TROI: Doctor, I think Commander Data will do very nicely. 
PULASKI: Your choice. 
(A little later, Deanna is in the birthing chair, almost upright) 
TROI: You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. 
PULASKI: There is nothing to be nervous about. 
DATA: Nervous? I find this very interesting. Although I understand, in
technical terms, how life is formed, there is still a part of the
process which eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to access
his thought process? Does he have thoughts? You are aware of him. Is he
aware of you? And when does that awareness begin? 
TROI: It's happening. 
DATA: How does it feel? 
TROI: Data! 
DATA: Yes? 
TROI: Now!
DATA: Now? Now! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! 
PULASKI: This is an impatient baby. He's eager to make his appearance.
Do you want something for the pain? It will in no way diminish the
experience. 
TROI: I have felt no pain. 
PULASKI: None? 
TROI: No, none at all. 
(Worf and two guards enter) 
PULASKI: Have your Security men stand back. I understand the importance
of having you here, but keep out from underfoot. Foetal position? 
NURSE: Normal. 
PULASKI: Foetal pulse? 
NURSE: One thirty seven. 
PULASKI: The baby is showing healthy respiratory movements. 
(Riker sneaks in to watch) 
PULASKI: (kneeling in front of Troi) The action of the heart rate is
good. The baby's doing wonderfully, Troi. Breathe slowly. You're doing
great. Stay calm. That's it. There it is. I've got him. You can relax. 
(Baby crying) 
PULASKI: (cleaning him off) There, there. That's a good boy. It's okay.
Oh, my, he's beautiful. (hands him to Troi) Are easy births the norm
for Betazoids? 
TROI: Not according to my mother. 
PULASKI: (to Worf) You can come in the rest of the way now. There's no
threat, Lieutenant. You and your men can relax. It's just a baby. 
(Worf looks and leaves) 
DATA: Thank you for allowing me to participate. It was remarkable. 
PULASKI: Do you have a name? 
TROI: Ian Andrew, after my father. 
(Riker comes forward) 
TROI: Were you hear all along? 
RIKER: Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. 
PULASKI: How do you feel? 
TROI: Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. 
PULASKI: Amazing.
