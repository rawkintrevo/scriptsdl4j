[Bridge]

PICARD: I thought that the weather control
malfunction was not severe.

[Engineering]

DATA: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir,
but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused an
unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I suggest we set up a power transfer between the
Enterprise and the weather substations. Try to give them enough power
to stabilise the storm. 
PICARD [OC]: Make it so. 
[Howard home]

(Beverly enters, soaked from the storm. The house
is filled with camellias) 
CRUSHER: Who's there? Ned? Is that you? Hello? I know somebody's here,
so I suggest you 
(a mirror bounced against the wall. She removes it and is about to put
it back when she sees the reflection of a man behind her. She drops the
mirror, but there is no one there) 
CRUSHER: All right now, that's it. If you don't show yourself right now
I am calling the Enterprise and there will be ten security guards here
within thirty seconds. 
RONIN [OC]: Beverly. Beverly, I've come back for you 
CRUSHER: Who are you? 
RONIN [OC]: Don't you remember? I came to you last night while you were
asleep. 
CRUSHER: No, that was a dream. I'm calling the Enterprise. 
(she goes weak at the knees) 
RONIN [OC]: Now do you remember me? 
CRUSHER: Yes. What's, what's happening to me? Right now I feel so
strange. 
RONIN [OC]: I love you, Beverly, just as I loved Felisa before you. 
CRUSHER: Are you Ronin? 
RONIN [OC]: Yes. You saw me at the funeral. 
(Beverly has a little orgasm) 
CRUSHER: Who are you? 
RONIN [OC]: I'm a spirit. 
CRUSHER: I don't believe in 
RONIN [OC]: Ghosts? Nor did I in the beginning. I was born in sixteen
forty seven, in Glasgow on Earth. 
CRUSHER: You're telling me that you're an eight hundred year old ghost?

RONIN [OC]: I found a home with Jessel Howard. She was a pretty lass
with a mane of red hair, and eyes like diamonds. I loved her very much.
When she died, I stayed with her daughter, and her daughter, and on
down through the years, generation after generation. 
CRUSHER: And now you're here on Caldos, two hundred light years away? 
RONIN [OC]: When your family moved out into the galaxy, I moved with
them. 
CRUSHER: I don't believe you. 
RONIN [OC]: I believe you are the most beautiful women I have ever
known. 
CRUSHER: What's, what's happening to me? 
RONIN [OC]: We're becoming one, Beverly. We're going to be together. 
CRUSHER: I don't understand. Stop it! 
[Crusher's quarters]

(Beverly is arranging flowers) 
CRUSHER: Come in. 
TROI: Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if you were going to mok'bara class
this morning. 
CRUSHER: No, I think I'll skip it today. I'm exhausted. 
TROI: Did you have another dream last night? 
CRUSHER: Not exactly. 
TROI: Is anything wrong? 
CRUSHER: Not at all. 
TROI: Beverly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were seeing
someone. 
CRUSHER: Deanna. 
TROI: Now I know you're seeing someone. 
CRUSHER: I'm not seeing anybody. I met someone, that's all. 
TROI: Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for him. Beverly, when
are you going to realise that you can't fool me? Who is it? 
CRUSHER: All right. I met Ronin. 
TROI: Ronin? Your grandmother's lover? 
CRUSHER: He's unlike anyone I've ever met before. I know this sounds
crazy, but I have never known anyone who was so 
TROI: Passionate. 
CRUSHER: Exactly. I can see why Nana fell in love with him. This sounds
very strange, doesn't it? 
TROI: I admit it's unusual. I'm very happy for you. But I want you to
consider something. You and Ronin have both suffered a tremendous loss.
Very often, shared traumatic experience can create the illusion of
closeness and romance. 
CRUSHER: Thank you for your concern, but I think I know what I'm doing.
Besides, I didn't say I was in love with him. I'm just intrigued.

[Turbolift]

MATURIN: You know, Captain, I moved to this colony
because it was a recreation of Scotland, but I must admit it's getting
to be a little too realistic. 
(he sneezes)
