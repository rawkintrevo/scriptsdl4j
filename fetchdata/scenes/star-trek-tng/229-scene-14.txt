[Alkar's quarters]

ALKAR: Deanna.
TROI: Hello.
ALKAR: Come in, please.
TROI: I thought you might like some company, if you're not too busy.
ALKAR: Nothing that can't wait. Would you like something to drink?
TROI: No. I'd like you to talk to me.
ALKAR: About?
TROI: About you. I don't know anything about you. And I'd like to.
ALKAR: There's not much to know. I lead a very simple life.
TROI: What kind of woman do you find attractive? Do you find me
attractive?
ALKAR: Extremely.
TROI: And when you find someone attractive, what do you usually do?
ALKAR: That depends on a lot of things.
TROI: Is it really so complicated?
ALKAR: It can be.
TROI: Well, perhaps you over think things.
(she's getting very seductive) 
ALKAR: Deanna.
TROI: Yes? 
ALKAR: I'm sorry. If I led you to believe? You are very beautiful, but
our relationship can't be like that.

[Turbolift]

(spurned and angry, Troi paces the lift. A tall
young man enters) 
ENSIGN: Deck four. 
(Troi looks at him with hungry eyes)

[Corridor]

CREWMAN: Sir. 
(Riker gets to Deanna's door. She's not in uniform) 
TROI: Will. 
RIKER: We were supposed to finish the crew evaluation reports.
TROI: Of course. Come in.
