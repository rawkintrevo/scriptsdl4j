LAFORGE: Lieutenant Shipley, let's get a
triangulation on these sector points. 
SHIPLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Sorry I'm late. I overslept again. What have we got? 
LAFORGE: Well, the cluster's a lot more dense than we thought. It's
going to take three days just to map out one tenth of it. 
RIKER: Three days? 
LAFORGE: I think we've found a way to speed that up a bit. We've been
testing a way of channelling warp energy directly to the main deflector
grid. It should enhance the long range sensors. 
DATA: The modification would increase our sensor efficiency and imaging
resolution by twenty five percent or more. 
RIKER: That sounds like that'll use up a lot of warp energy. 
LAFORGE: We'd channel it through the EPS mains on deck four, near Cargo
bay four. 
RIKER: Okay, let's give it a try. 
LAFORGE: Data, let's get those field taps online. 
DATA: Commander, I would like to remind you about my poetry reading
this afternoon. 
RIKER: I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
LAFORGE: I can't wait to see what he's come up with.
