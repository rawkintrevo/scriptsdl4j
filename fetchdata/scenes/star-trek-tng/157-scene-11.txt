[Riker's quarters]

DATA [OC]: Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to your
request for access to their databases. They are now being transmitted
into our computer over subspace link. 
RIKER: Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when Acamar's medical database is
online. Riker out. Come in. 
YUTA: I'm disturbing you. 
RIKER: Not at all. 
YUTA: As the Sovereign has no further need for my services this
evening, she suggested I might spend some time with you. 
RIKER: What a charming suggestion. 
YUTA: She appreciates the affection you've shown me. 
RIKER: Was I that obvious? 
YUTA: Yes. 
RIKER: Well, I've already dined. Maybe you know a good Acamarian
dessert recipe. 
(A kiss, of course) 
YUTA: Does that not please you? Tell me what you want, William. I will
do anything you wish. 
RIKER: Wait a minute. 
YUTA: I don't understand. Don't you want me to give you pleasure? 
RIKER: Not as a servant. I told you, I prefer equals. 
YUTA: Even in the matters of love? 
RIKER: Especially in matters of love. 
YUTA: I've offended you. 
RIKER: No. I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
You're entitled to that. 
YUTA: No, I'm not. 
RIKER: Yuta. 
YUTA: I do not feel pleasure, or passion. I haven't been able to for a
long time. 
RIKER: I don't know who did this to you, or why, but it can change. 
YUTA: I wish it could. Tonight most of all. I'm sorry. 
(She turns to go, he pulls her back into his embrace, then Red Alert
sounds and the ship shakes) 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Your people prepare a warm welcome. 
BRULL: That's Chorgan's ship. 
WORF: Shields holding. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us to
talk. 
WORF: Chorgan is not responding. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriously
damaging their ship? 
WORF: I believe we can, sir. 
PICARD: Prepare phasers and open a channel. 
WORF: Phasers locked. Channel open. 
PICARD: Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. All
right, let's focus their attention. Mister Worf, fire phasers. 
WORF: Their forward shields are inoperative. 
PICARD: Well done, Lieutenant. 
WORF: We are being hailed, sir. 
PICARD: That's better. On screen. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: Brull, you traitor! You have led them here to
destroy me! 
PICARD: Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you would not be
talking to me now. Obviously, I wanted something else. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: And what is that? 
PICARD: I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Three. I want you to
hear what she and Brull have to say. 
BRULL: She's worth listening to. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: I don't wish to listen to either of you. 
PICARD: You have no choice. Prepare to receive us. We're beaming on
board. Picard out. Cancel Red Alert. Tell Sovereign Marouk meet me in
transporter three. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: You're going alone, Captain? 
PICARD: The danger is minimal, Number One. Chorgan is unlikely to do
anything rash with the Enterprise's phasers trained on his ship. 
RIKER: There are still risks. 
PICARD: For these negotiations to succeed I must be a mediator, not an
enforcer. You have the Bridge, Number One. Brull.
