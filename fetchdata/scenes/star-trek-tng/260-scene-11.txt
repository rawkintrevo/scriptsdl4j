[Camp]

(surrounded by night and trees, they've got a fire
lit) 
PICARD: No luck? 
CRUSHER: I'm beginning to think there's not a single thing on this
planet we can eat. 
PICARD: Well, by this time tomorrow we could be back on the Enterprise
and you can plant yourself in front of a replicator with a knife and
fork. 
CRUSHER: Remember that Vulcan dish I promised you for breakfast? I was
just. You hate having breakfast with me. 
PICARD: That's not true. 
CRUSHER: Yes, it is. When I said breakfast, I heard you say, I hate
that. 
PICARD: That's not quite what I meant. 
CRUSHER: Well, then what did you mean? 
PICARD: It's just that I don't like 
CRUSHER: What I've been choosing for breakfast recently. 
PICARD: You see, I think that breakfast should be a simple meal and
recently you've been ordering these elaborate things. 
CRUSHER: Coffee and croissants, that's all you really want, isn't it?
Coffee and croissants. Well why didn't you just say so? 
PICARD: I didn't think it was important. You don't like those elaborate
meals either. 
CRUSHER: No, I usually prefer something simple myself but I thought you
might enjoy more variety. Well, I guess it's Coffee and croissants for
both of us from now on. 
GUEST4: I love firelight. 
PICARD: There's something about the flame, the smell of the smoke. It's
always seemed to me to be intoxicating, somehow. 
CRUSHER: I remember when Jack and I took Wesley on his first camping
trip to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept throwing manta leaves in the fire,
watching them pop. Jack kept telling him. What? Jean-Luc, I heard you.
Don't push it away. When I said Jack and I, I felt this sudden wave of
something. I didn't know you felt that way. 
PICARD: Didn't you? 
CRUSHER: I guess I always knew that there was an attraction between us
right from the start, but I never knew how strongly you felt. Why
didn't you ever tell me you were in love with me? 
PICARD: You were married to my best friend. At first I thought it was
harmless infatuation. Something hormonal rather than emotional. 
CRUSHER: Then when the months went by and the three of us began
spending more time together. 
PICARD: I realised that it was something else, and it wasn't right. But
although I would never act on it, I couldn't help the way I felt. 
CRUSHER: And when Jack died you felt guilty. 
PICARD: I felt guilty before he died Having feelings like that
for my best friend's wife. And then later, after the accident, I
promised myself that I would never tell you know how I felt. It would
be like betraying my friend 
CRUSHER: That's why you didn't want me on the Enterprise seven years
ago. 
PICARD: I didn't know how I would react. And then, little by little, I
realised that I didn't have those feelings any more. Twenty years is,
after all, a long time. 
CRUSHER: And now we're friends. 
PICARD: Yes, friends. 
CRUSHER: Well, we still have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow. We
should get some sleep. 
PICARD: Right.
