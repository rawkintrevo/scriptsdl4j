intercom) 
KELSEY [OC]: Kelsey to Kiros. 
KIROS [OC]: This is Kiros. 
KELSEY [OC]: We have a problem. There's a Starfleet officer still on

destroyed the diverter in Engineering so we have to leave here before

KIROS [OC]: What about the trilithium resin? 
KELSEY [OC]: We're taking it with us to Ten Forward. There should be
enough time before
PICARD: Kelsey. Don't be a fool.

PICARD [OC]: You know better than to try and move
trilithium resin. 
KELSEY: Mister Mot. Or should I call you Lieutenant? Lieutenant
Commander perhaps? 
PICARD [OC]: You may call me whatever you wish. 
[Worf's quarters]

PICARD: Moving trilithium resin requires very
