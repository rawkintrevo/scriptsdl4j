MCDOWELL PICARD RIKER BROSSMER DATA

[Romulan Engineering]

BROSSMER [OC]: They should be returning to your
coordinates, sir. 
RIKER: Chief, do you have them? They're not here. 
BROSSMER [OC]: No, sir. 
RIKER: Where are they? 
[Transporter room]

BROSSMER: I can't locate their patterns. 
[Romulan Engineering]

BROSSMER [OC]: We've lost them, sir. 
[Bridge]

BROSSMER [OC]: I've done all I can, sir. I'm afraid
they're gone. 
PICARD: Mister Data, begin a level one diagnostic. All transporter
systems offline until further notice. Could they have materialised
somewhere else? 
DATA: Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to locate them anywhere
within transporter range. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
(Troi shakes her head) 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Enterprise. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

[Romulan Engineering]

RIKER: Captain, we're still looking at a core
breach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: I need replacement personnel, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, you may continue the diagnostic of the transporter
systems at another time. Take a shuttlecraft and two more engineers
down to the Romulan ship. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister McDowell, alert the main shuttlebay to have all
available ships and pilots standing by in case we need them. 
MCDOWELL: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course away from the Romulan vessel. Engage at
warp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode.
