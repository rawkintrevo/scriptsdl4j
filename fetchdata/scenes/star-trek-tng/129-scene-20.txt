[Street]

LAFORGE: It's still running. The programme didn't
shut down. 
DATA: We must see the Captain. 
[Corridor]

LAFORGE: Data, wait. What is it? What's on that
paper? And why can't we shut down the holodeck? Data. 
DATA: This. 
LAFORGE: This is impossible. How can a character from 1890's London
draw a picture of the Enterprise? Who's got control of the computer? 
DATA: He does. Moriarty. 
LAFORGE: That is impossible? I don't understand. 
DATA: Nor do I. 
LAFORGE: Data, wait. What about the doctor? Is she all right in there? 
DATA: No. She is in grave danger.

[Observation Lounge]

PICARD: Computer, why wasn't the holodeck programme
terminated? 
COMPUTER: The override protocol has been initiated. 
PICARD: On whose authority? 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Geordi La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Me? 
PICARD: All right, tell me from the beginning exactly what happened. 
LAFORGE: Well, Doctor Pulaski and I had a discussion about whether Data
could solve an original Holmes-type mystery. 
PICARD: Which you asked the computer to provide. 
LAFORGE: Yes, with a worthy opponent. 
PICARD: Worthy of Holmes? 
(watch the penny drop) 
LAFORGE: Oh, my God. I asked for a Holmes-type mystery with an opponent
capable of defeating Data. That got to be it. 
PICARD: Merde. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. 
PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. 
DATA: Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. 
PICARD: So, he has access to the computer. 
DATA: And perhaps our library files as well, sir. That level of
information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for
me. 
PICARD: Theorise, Data. What are his limits? 
DATA: He is still a fictional character, sir, originally programmed
with nineteenth century knowledge. 
RIKER: Which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge. 
PICARD: What does he need to begin making use of that? 
DATA: Only time, sir. 
WORF: Sir, I can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck, find the
Doctor, and bring her out. 
DATA: Captain, I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. It is
probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden. 
PICARD: Computer, where is Doctor Pulaski. 
COMPUTER: Doctor Pulaski is on holodeck two. 
PICARD: And her vital signs? 
COMPUTER: Strong and stable. 
RIKER: Captain, recommend we try to destroy the hologram generations
themselves. Is that possible, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Using wave guides, I could split a particle stream out of the
matter/antimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit
into the holodeck. If accelerated to sufficient velocity that would
quite literally wash away all present holographic constructs. The
London buildings, the streets, the people, all gone including Moriarty.

PICARD: Doctor Pulaski? 
RIKER: The particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well. 
TROI: Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if a
unifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all into
focus. 
DATA: There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty to
defeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which I
possess. 
PICARD: Exactly what? 
DATA: Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. 
(The ship jerks suddenly from side to side) 
PICARD: Computer, what happened? 
COMPUTER: Attitude and stabilisation control of the Enterprise was
momentarily transferred to holodeck two. 
PICARD: Data, I think it best that you and I should return to the
holodeck. 
DATA: I will change into my uniform, sir. 
PICARD: No. I will change into some appropriate costume. Uniforms might
pose questions I'd rather he didn't ask. It seems that he feeds on
knowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information than
we have to.

[Moriarty's room]

PULASKI: How did you make the room shake? 
MORIARTY: I'm not sure. Now, dear lady, will that be one lump or two? 
(They are taking afternoon tea) 
PULASKI: Lumps, Professor? What sort of lumps? 
(He puts one sugar lump into her cup) 
MORIARTY: Milk, of course? 
PULASKI: Why not. 
MORIARTY: Mister Computer proposes the incredible thought that we are
all travelling in a great vessel of some sort.
Is that true? 
PULASKI: I don't know what you're talking about. 
MORIARTY: The scones are likewise a must. 
PULASKI: This is really quite excellent. 
MORIARTY: Strange. It actually pleases me to hear you say that. 
PULASKI: Very strange. You're beginning to sound very different from
the Moriarty I've read about. 
MORIARTY: You're not frightened of me? 
PULASKI: No. 
MORIARTY: You should be. Mister Computer, the arch, please. A few more
questions, Mister Computer. 
(Moriarty taps at the control panel) 
MORIARTY: I just can't seem to remember that last command. Ah, well,
sooner or later it'll all come to me. But, in the meantime, I have
decided to approach the problem from a more familiar perspective.
There's really no reason why I shouldn't be able to use some of the
knowledge from my world in order to bring me closer to yours. 
PULASKI: I have no idea what you're talking about. 
MORIARTY: Of course you do, Madam. The more you proclaim your
ignorance, the more you try to mislead me, the more I am on to you.
Your every silence speaks volumes. 
PULASKI: Good, then if you know what I'm saying when I'm not saying
anything, what do you need me for? Thank you for the tea and crumpets.
I guess I'll be going. 
MORIARTY: Where? Back to here? 
(A diagram of the Enterprise on his blackboard) 
PULASKI: Yes. Would you care to join me? 
MORIARTY: In time. In time I will leave all of this and join you out
there. Or is this where we both are right now? 
PULASKI: Right now, we are in London. Tell me what you want from me, or
allow me to leave. 
MORIARTY: Frankly, now I want nothing more than what the fisherman
expects of the worm. You, dear Doctor, will be the lure, and this will
be the hook for your Captain, Jean Luc Picard. 
PULASKI: Who is that? 
MORIARTY: How well you know.

[Outside holodeck]

(Worf enters from the turbolift, in a smart frock
coat and grey gloves) 
RIKER: Nice suit. 
WORF: Thank you. Captain, I will be standing by to assist you if
needed. 
RIKER: You'll be a big hit in London. 
PICARD: (a gentleman with opera hat and cane) Computer, tell me, is the
programme
still running? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. You may enter. 
PICARD: Data, shall we go? Gentlemen. Open. 
[Street]

(Parts of the holodeck grid are visible, there is a
heavy mist off the river and the people are unhappy) 
PICARD: We don't have much time. He's getting more control of his
environment. Let's see if we can't beat Professor Moriarty by giving
him everything he wants. 
(Outside the Ale and Stout house) 
PICARD: Obviously, he's trying to alter the programming here. 
(Picard picks up a coin) 
DATA: Captain? 
PICARD: Tuppence. Two pence. Supposed to be good luck. We may need
some. 
RUFFIAN: I'll take that coin, sir. That's right, and any more you got
too. 
PICARD: Excuse me. 
RUFFIAN: I don't think so. I want all that money. That's right. I want
it now. 
PICARD: Data. 
(Data disarms the mugger by squeezing his thumb) 
DATA: Captain, this holographic image differs from any I have ever
seen. Could he have actually injured you? 
PICARD: It's more serious than that. I think the mortality fail-safe
may have been circumvented. He could've killed me. 
RUFFIAN: Come on, let it go, guv. He's hurting me! 
PICARD: Data, let him go. 
DATA: We will find Moriarty this way, sir. The warehouse.
