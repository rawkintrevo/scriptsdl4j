[Compound]

(Worf goes to a pile of barrels marked with the
Romulan insignia, does something with the piece of equipment and drops
it amongst them. Then he hears gentle, melodic singing) 
BA'EL: Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo. ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' 
WORF: Do you know what that song means? 
BA'EL: No. I just like the melody. 
(the barrels explode. Worf makes to climb the wall) 
ROMULAN: Stop!

(Two Romulans track Worf) 
ROMULAN: There. 
(Worf spots Shrek and his little ship but is jumped by Toq! He
restrains from hurting the boy and the Romulans catch him)

RIKER: Still no sign of them on long range
scanners. 
PICARD: Contact DS9. Find out what they know about this Yridian trader.

RIKER: Hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station. 
PICARD: That's the only chance we have of finding Worf. 
[Meeting hall]

TOKATH: We haven't had to use one of these for a
long time. It implants a small boridium pellet under the skin. (he
injects Worf) We can
use its energy signature to track you. 
L'KOR: In time, you will grow accustomed to life here. 
WORF: Never. 
TOKATH: He is one of yours. Deal with him however you like. But I warn
you, if he becomes a disruption, I will not be so tolerant. 
L'KOR: Toq. You guard him. He is free to move around inside the
compound. But make certain he does not cause trouble.
