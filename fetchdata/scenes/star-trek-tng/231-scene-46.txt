PICARD SHIPLEY DATA LAFORGE

[Cargo bay]

DATA: Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse is
having an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent.

(the light gets brighter) 
DATA: Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They are
reinforcing the tetryon emissions. They appear to be counter-acting the
graviton pulse. 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: The rupture is beginning to expand
again, sir. 
LAFORGE: Looks like somebody is fighting back. 
PICARD: Can you strengthen the graviton pulse? 
LAFORGE: I can try to set up a random frequency shift. If we can keep
them from guessing our pulse modulation, they might not be able to
compensate.

(Riker is sitting up and being ignored by the
aliens) 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: Tetryon emissions continue to increase. The
rupture is still expanding. 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: Hull breach is imminent. 
LAFORGE: They're reacting faster than we can shift frequencies.
Shipley, programme
the emitters for full spectrum pulse compression. I want to channel all
of the graviton energy into a single burst. Let's see if they can
handle that. 
SHIPLEY: Ready, Commander.

(Now there are four aliens fussing around a control
panel)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: The rupture is beginning to close, sir. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Recharge the emitters. Let's hit them
again. Come on. 
SHIPLEY: Ready.
