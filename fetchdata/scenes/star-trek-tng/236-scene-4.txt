JELLICO: It caught me by surprise too. I must
admit, I miss the Cairo already. But a Galaxy class ship, that's
something special. I can understand why you turned down a ship of your

JELLICO: How many duty watches does the crew stand?

like to examine the duty roster and the crew evaluations as soon as
possible. I want readiness reports from each department head by

hundred. Do you prefer Will or William? 
RIKER: Er, Will, sir.
