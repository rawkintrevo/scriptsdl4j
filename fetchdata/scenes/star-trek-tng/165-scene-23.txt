great monitor calls away number located child home shields

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: I've got something. Worf was not the only
survivor of the Khitomer massacre. 
RIKER: Another child? 
CRUSHER: No. A Klingon woman was found with Worf. 
(She calls up the record on a monitor) 
RIKER: Kahlest. Who was she? 
CRUSHER: I don't know, but the report said she was severely injured,
was transferred to Starbase twenty four for treatment. That was when
she was separated from Worf. And after her recovery, she returned home.

RIKER: We've got to find her, if she's still alive. Data, scan the
Klingon central net. See if there's any record of her.

[Great Hall]

DURAS: The Romulans lowered the outpost shields themselves. They were
given the defense access code! The record clearly show the Romulan
patrol ship receiving a personal transmission from Mogh seconds before
the shields fell. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Stand by. 
DURAS: The Khitomer commander noted in his log that Mogh had been
acting suspiciously. 
(Picard moves away to take his call privately) 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

RIKER: We've located another survivor of the
Khitomer massacre, Captain a woman who was found with Worf. Her name is
Kahlest.
