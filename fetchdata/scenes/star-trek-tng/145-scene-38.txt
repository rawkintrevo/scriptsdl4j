[Rex's Bar]

REX: Good God, what's that? 
(Lwaxana and Homn enter) 
REX: I'll bet that's the broad with the big bucks. Come on over here,
darlin'. I got the best stool in the house saved for you. 
LWAXANA: So, this is where you've been hiding, Jean-Luc. I'm surprised
you let this part of the ship get this dirty. Oh, relax, Commander.
You've been making your true feelings quite clear. Obviously you feel
unable to handle me. 
REX: Anyway, why would a beautiful high-class lady like yourself want
to hook up with a mug like that? You're too good for him, if you ask
me. 
LWAXANA: You are a very interesting person. 
REX: You're not so bad yourself. In fact, you're as much class as this
joint's ever seen. Here. On the house. It's French. Almost. 
LWAXANA: This is the most remarkable man. I have never met anyone quite
like him. 
PICARD: I don't suppose you have. 
LWAXANA: He's strong. I get no thoughts from him at all. Nothing. I've
never known a man so able to keep his true feelings completely hidden. 
PICARD: That's because 
LWAXANA: No man has ever been such a mystery to me. I usually know
their thoughts before they do. 
REX: But not with me, huh? 
LWAXANA: No. And I never realised how erotic that could be. Carry my
beverage to that table. We have some things to discuss. 
RIKER: Should we tell her? 
PICARD: I think it would be only fair. But let's allow her the moment.

[Sickbay]

ANTEDEANS: Food. Food. Food. Food. Food. 
PULASKI: Worf, the vermicula. 
(The barrel is opened, and the two fishy aliens almost dive in head
first) 
PULASKI: Pulaski to Captain Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor. 
PULASKI [OC]: Our passengers are on their feet. 
[Rex's Bar]

PICARD: Understood. 
RIKER: I'd better get to the Bridge. 
PICARD: What's their condition? 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Hungry. Would you like to be shown to your
rooms?
