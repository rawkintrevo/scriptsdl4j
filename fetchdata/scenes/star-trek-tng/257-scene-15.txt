CRUSHER: Well, that's my third scan and I still
haven't find anything out of the ordinary. 
WORF: He must be hiding something. We should download his computer
memory and analyse it. 
CRUSHER: I'd have a hard time defending that as part of a safety
inspection. 
WORF: We could claim that the computer was generating abnormal
radiation signatures. 
CRUSHER: Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground as it is. We can't just

PICARD: Don't! 
RIKER: Watch that door. 
WORF: What is going on? 
NARIK: Shut your mouth, Klingon. 
RIKER: I guess you're surprised to see me, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: You could say that. 
RIKER: I've had a change of profession. 
PICARD: It's not in here. Hey, you, where's the artefact? 
WORF: I do not know what you're talking about. 
RIKER: Use your brain. They wouldn't be searching the shuttle if they
had the artefact. Koral must have it. Where is that Klingon pilot? 
CRUSHER: In the Observation lounge with Data and Troi. 
NARIK: How far? 
RIKER: Twelve decks away. 
WORF: Security will not allow you to get that far. 
RIKER: They won't get the chance. We'll use the transporter in that
shuttle. We'll beam directly to the Observation lounge. Sorry about
this. 
(Riker shoots Worf and Crusher) 
RIKER: Let's go.

[Observation lounge]

DATA: If you could tell us something about the
nature of your mission. 
(the raiding party beam in) 
KORAL: What is this? 
RIKER: Quiet! (Picard scans Koral) Does he have it? 
(Picard takes a small item from Koral's jacket) 
PICARD: This is it. 
NARIK: Are you sure, Galen? 
PICARD: Yes, I can recognise the inscription pattern from the first
artefact. 
DATA: Commander Riker, by taking this action you risk charges of
assault, theft, piracy, and treason. 
RIKER: Really? Then I guess adding one more charge wouldn't hurt. 
(Riker shoots at Picard and misses. Picard doesn't miss) 
PICARD: Is he dead? 
TROI: Yes. 
PICARD: Good. Activate the transporter. 
(the raiding party beam out) 
DATA: Security alert. Medical emergency team to the Observation lounge.
Data to Bridge. Raise shields and begin sensor sweeps for the mercenary
ship. 
GIUSTI [OC]: Aye, sir. 
TROI: He's all right. He's only stunned. 
DATA: I must admit, I am experiencing a similar sensation. 
RIKER: This is going to take a little time to explain.
