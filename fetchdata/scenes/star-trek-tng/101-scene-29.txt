TROI LAFORGE TASHA RIKER WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Sickbay]

WESLEY: There's a low gravity gymnasium, too. It'd
be hard to get bored on this ship. 
CRUSHER: Good. 
WESLEY: Mom, could you get me a look at the Bridge? 
CRUSHER: That's against the Captain's standing orders. 
WESLEY: Are you afraid of the Captain too? 
CRUSHER: I certainly am not. 
WESLEY: But Captain Picard is a pain, isn't he? 
CRUSHER: Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often
lonely. No chance to have a family. 
WESLEY: Just a look, at the Bridge. I'll stay in the turbolift when the
doors open. I won't get off. 
CRUSHER: You are asking for trouble, Wes. We'll see what we can do.

[Market place]

TASHA: Recommend that someone could begin by
examining the underside of the station, sir. 
TROI: Our sensors do show some passages, sir. Perhaps you and I? 
RIKER: Tasha, you and the Counsellor. And, Geordi, I want your eyes
down there. (to Data) You and I will start with topside. 
(As the three explore underground) 
RIKER: Have you noticed anything unusual? 
DATA: I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far the material seems
rather very ordinary. 
RIKER: Construction records? 
DATA: Construction records show this to be almost identical to that
which Starfleet uses. 
TASHA [OC]: Team Leader. 
[Passageway]

TASHA: We've found something interesting. We're in
a passageway directly under the station, sir. 
LAFORGE: But these tunnel walls are something I've never seen before,
sir. 
[Marketplace]

RIKER: How are you examining them? 
LAFORGE [OC]: In every way.
