PICARD: Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan?
They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You know
the effects of your poison. 
LUTAN: But what of your Lieutenant Yar? She is to become my First One
now. 
PICARD: I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. 
HAGON: Remember, you now have all Yareena's lands and wealth now. 
LUTAN: At least all has not been lost. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
RIKER [OC]: Since you've fulfilled your agreement, Captain, can we now
beam the vaccine aboard? 
LUTAN: Ah, yes, of course. 
PICARD: No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. 
RIKER [OC]: And to complete our business here, we are locked onto you. 
PICARD: Five to beam up. Energise.

First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I am
returning the conn to Captain Picard as we begin loading the vaccine
supply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal mission complete.

(Picard, Troi, Lutan and Hagon enter) 
RIKER: Welcome back, Captain. You're wanted in the lounge. 
PICARD: This way, gentlemen.

[Observation Lounge]

(Tasha and Beverly are there with Yareena) 
LUTAN: She is not dead! There was no death combat. You violated our
agreement. There will be no treaty, no vaccine! 
PICARD: The challenge was carried out. She died, Lutan. 
LUTAN: There was no challenge! She lives! 
CRUSHER: I am a physician and saw her die. If you doubt this poison,
why don't you test it on yourself? 
PICARD: Lutan, we can provide you with records of her death and how
Doctor Crusher brought her back. 
YAREENA: And at the instant of death, Lutan, a mating agreement
dissolves. 
LUTAN: But this is witchcraft, Yareena. To discard a mate in this
manner 
YAREENA: Is less painful than the one you selected for me. 
(She takes the necklace off him) 
LUTAN: Yareena, no. 
YAREENA: Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard you calling out for me. 
HAGON: Yareena, be my First One. 
YAREENA: All my land and all my goods, all I have is yours to rule. 
(She puts the necklace on Hagon) 
TASHA: How so sad for you. You've lost everything. 
LUTAN: I have my honour. 
TASHA: It's such a waste. 
YAREENA: Do you want him? 
TASHA: No. There would be complications. 
YAREENA: Then I will have you as my Number Two. Take your place
accordingly. 
HAGON: Well, as you see, Captain, you may excel in technology, but not
in civilised behaviour.
