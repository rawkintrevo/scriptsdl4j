TROI LAFORGE CREWMAN RIKER GUINAN BARCLAY

  [Ten
Forward]

(Deanna slinks in wearing an off the shoulder
number, as Howling Mad Murdoch pours himself a slug from a bottle on
the bar) 
GUINAN: I don't want any trouble here, Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Trouble? Why would there be trouble? 
GUINAN: Because wherever you go, trouble follows. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Barclay, you're on duty. 
BARCLAY: Is that a fact? 
LAFORGE: It is, and you'll observe it. So get back to your post. 
BARCLAY: Look, pal, why don't you do me a favour. Take yourself and
your holier than thou attitude and get out of my life. 
(He pushes Geordi away, sending him tumbling over a chair) 
RIKER: This is insubordination, Mister Barclay. 
BARCLAY: (drinking) Here's to insubordination. 
(Then he gets Riker in an arm and neck lock) 
BARCLAY: Riker, you're nothing but a pretty mannequin in a fancy
uniform. You're full of hot air. If Picard has a problem with me, you
can tell him to come and talk to me himself. 
(Geordi leaves, fast, as Barclay swaggers over to Troi) 
TROI: I feel your confidence, your arrogant resolve. It excites me. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Lieutenant Barclay, report to Cargo bay five. Now. 
BARCLAY: It'll have to wait till later, darling. 
TROI: Oh. 
BARCLAY: Be right there. Save programme.
