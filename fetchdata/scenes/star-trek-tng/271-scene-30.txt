PICARD COMPUTER DATA

[Corridor]

(the terrified not-yet-a-proto-lemur sneaks out
through Crusher's office door and squirts the scent into the air,
backing down the dark corridor. The armoured monster leaves the door
and follows the trail)

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Deck seventeen. Deck seventeen! 
(the doors shut in the nick of time but it doesn't move. Worf starts
hammering at the door and Picard escapes through the roof)

[Sickbay]

(Data gives Alyssa a hypospray) 
DATA: Computer, display progress of genetic re-sequencing.

[Jefferies tube]

(Worf sprays venom on Picard's arm from above
through a grating and Picard drops the phaser)

[Sickbay]

COMPUTER: Genetic re-sequencing in progress. DNA to
seventy percent normal. 
DATA: Computer, increase nucleotide substitution by thirty two percent.

[Jefferies tube]

(at the point of the original hole, Picard
insulates himself on a panel cover and jabs a live cable onto the metal
framework. Finally Worf collapses.)

[Sickbay]

(Alyssa is back to normal) 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. 
[Jefferies tube]

PICARD: Go ahead, Data. 
DATA: The retro virus is working, sir.
