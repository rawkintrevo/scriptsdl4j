[Corridor]

RIKER: The Romulan craft is a total loss. There's
nothing there to salvage unless you want to use tweezers. 
PICARD: No sign of others? 
RIKER: You couldn't see two metres in front of yourself down there. 
PICARD: It certainly is the last place one would expect Romulan
encroachment. On the other hand, Galorndon Core
would provide ideal cover for an opening move of a new offensive. 
RIKER: I doubt if they were there for the climate.

[Pit]

(Geordi has spotted some medal ore in the wall of
the pit. He makes a groove in the mud, puts the nodules in it then uses
his phaser to melt them into a dagger shape)

[Sickbay]

(Crusher is operating on the injured Romulan) 
CRUSHER: We thought it would be like working on Vulcans, but there are
subtle differences. Too many of them. 
PICARD: Can you treat him? 
CRUSHER: He has cell damage to vital areas. He's going to need a
transfusion of compatible ribosomes in order to recover.
I'm setting up a schedule to test every member of the crew. 
PICARD: We can't use the replicator? 
CRUSHER: The molecules are too complex. 
RIKER: Will he survive? 
CRUSHER: I can't answer that yet. 
RIKER: Well let me put it another way. Will he survive long enough to
tell us what he was doing here? 
PICARD: Doctor, it's an important consideration. 
CRUSHER: I can bring him around for a few minutes. But there is one
serious complication. His brainwaves indicate early neural-pathway
degeneration. 
RIKER: Head injury? 
CRUSHER: There's no obvious cranial trauma. I'm guessing his exposure
to the magnetic fields on the surface was slowly breaking down his
synaptic connections. 
RIKER: Will it affect Geordi the same way? 
(She nods, then injects the Romulan) 
CRUSHER: He'll be conscious for a minute or two. 
RIKER: You are on board the Federation Starship Enterprise. We're
treating your injuries. How long were you down on Galorndon Core? Do
you understand me? 
GUEST0: I will not answer questions. 
RIKER: We need to know if there are other survivors on the surface. 
GUEST0: I am alone. I will not answer any questions. 
RIKER: Do you have a mother ship who should be advised of your
condition? 
(He passes out again)
PICARD: The only answer he wants to give is that he was alone. 
RIKER: Which suggests that he wasn't.
