(an emergency is being rushed in on a trolley) 
NURSE: Watch the door. Careful, he may have suffered cranial damage. 
TAVA: Move him onto the diagnostic pad. 
NURSE: Right. 
TAVA: Slowly. 
NURSE: Right, here we go.

TAVA: Slowly. That's good. 
NURSE: All right. Careful. 
(the patient is hooked up to monitors) 
NILREM: Readings? 
NURSE: They're fluctuating, sir.
NILREM: He took a severe blow. Possible trauma to the telencephalon. 
TAVA: Start fifteen octares of quadroline. We'll need a complete
del-scan series.

TAVA: What do you mean? I'm reading a steady circulation. 
NILREM: There it is. Up here. 
TAVA: In his digestive tract? 
NILREM: Ever seen anything like this? 
(Tava, a female doctor, palpates the chest) 
TAVA: He's missing three costal struts on one side and four on the
other. 
NILREM: You think that's something? Look at this 
(holds up a foot) 
NILREM: He has digits on his terminus. 
(Tava removes the mittens to reveal the patient has fingers, unlike his
alien doctors)
