POLICEMAN: Keep back! 
CRUSHER: Put that away. I'm a doctor. (to an injured woman) Just lie
still. Try not to move. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf, I need some bandages, disinfectant, something
with alcohol in it. 
WORF: Doctor, it is not safe. 
CRUSHER: That's an order, Lieutenant.

CRUSHER: Don't be afraid. There's a lot of bleeding, but it's not as
bad as it looks.

could be another bomb. (to bystanders) Clear this area. Everyone out
of the plaza.

Enterprise. There are physicians on this planet.
