[Corridor]

DATA: Commander, the holodeck appears to be in
operation. 
RIKER: I thought you shut down the entire system. 
DATA: I did, but it has reactivated itself and it will not disengage. 
WORF: Which programme is running? 
DATA: Several different programs are running simultaneously. 
RIKER: This should be interesting. 
[Holodeck- train]

(a knight in armour is cutting a newspaper, a
rustic is standing, two 1920's women and a man are working on a jigsaw,
a gunslinger takes a piece out of his pocket and adds it to the jigsaw)

RIKER: You weren't kidding, Mister Data. 
DATA: No, sir. I estimate that this scene consists of portions of seven
distinct holodeck programs. 
RIKER: See if you can access the circuits that have been affected by
the nodes. 
(an American train conductor enters) 
CONDUCTOR: Tickets! Tickets please. Please have your tickets ready.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Tickets
please. 
RUSTIC: You know, I've never even been away from home. Now I'm going
all the way to Vertiform City! 
CONDUCTOR: Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip. Tickets please. Tickets.
Thank you sir. 
(The conductor clips one of the knight's string of paper dolls) 
CONDUCTOR: Tickets please. Tickets please. 
DATA: Commander. I have located a large concentration of nodes behind
this wall. They appear to be connected directly to the holodeck's main
power coupling. 
RIKER: All right, go ahead and depolarise the entire power grid. 
DATA: The power grid is located beneath this deck, sir. 
CONDUCTOR: Get away from there. Would you gentlemen care to show me
your tickets? 
RIKER: I believe we left our tickets in our compartments. Mister Worf,
I told you to bring the tickets. 
WORF: I forgot. 
CONDUCTOR: I don't think you folks belong on this train. 
ENGINEER: Hold it! You leave these people alone. They're only trying to
help. 
CONDUCTOR: You go back to the engine. This doesn't concern you. 
ENGINEER: They're all trying to hijack the train. 
RUSTIC: Hey, if you're the Engineer, who's doing the drivin'? 
(a gangster shoots the Engineer in the back) 
GANGSTER: I am.

[Engineering]

(a console explodes in front of Geordi, throwing
him backwards) 
CREWMAN: Easy, sir, easy. I've got you.
LAFORGE: I'm all right, thanks. It looks like the navigational relay's
overloaded. 
[Holodeck train]

(the conductor pulls the cord and the train
lurches. So does the ship) 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Geordi, what's going on? We just went
into warp. 
LAFORGE: We've lost engine and helm control again, Captain, but this
time, they're completely burned out. I don't know if we can stop the
ship.
