RIKER PICARD ENSIGN WESLEY COMPUTER CRUSHER DATA

[Corridor]

RIKER: Ensign, can you help me find Commander Data?
I understand he's somewhere on this deck. 
ENSIGN: This way, sir. You must be new to these Galaxy class starships,
sir. (to wall) Tell me the location of Commander Data. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Commander Data now located in Holodeck area 4J. 
ENSIGN: And as you see, sir, it's pointing you that way. 
RIKER: Thank you 
ENSIGN: You're welcome, sir. 
(She appreciates the sight as he walks away) 
COMPUTER: The next hatchway on your right. 
RIKER: Thank you. 
COMPUTER: You're welcome, Commander Riker. And if you care to enter,
Commander? 
RIKER: I do. 
(The holodeck doors open to show trees and vegetation. There is
birdsong)

[Forest]

RIKER: Hello? 
(He crosses a stream by stepping stones. One wobbles. Someone is trying
to whistle 'Pop goes the Weasel'. Riker finishes the tune) 
DATA: Marvellous. How easily humans do that. I still need much
practice. 
RIKER: There are some puzzles down on the planet that the Captain wants
answered. He suggests that I take you with me on the away team that
I'll be leading. 
DATA: I shall endeavour to function adequately, sir. 
RIKER: Yes. When the captain suggested you, I looked up your record. 
DATA: Yes, sir. A wise procedure, sir, always. 
RIKER: Then your rank of Lieutenant Commander is honorary? 
DATA: No, sir. Starfleet class of '78. Honours in probability mechanics
and exobiology. 
RIKER: Your file says that you're an 
DATA: Machine, Correct, sir. Does that trouble you? 
RIKER: To be honest, yes, a little. 
DATA: Understood, sir. Prejudice is very human. 
RIKER: Now that does trouble me. Do you consider yourself superior to
us? 
DATA: I am superior, sir, in many ways, but I would gladly give it up
to be human. 
RIKER: Nice to meet you, Pinocchio. A joke. 
DATA: Ah. Intriguing. 
RIKER: You're going to be an interesting companion, Mister Data. 
DATA: This woodland pattern is quite popular, sir. Perhaps because it
duplicates Earth so well. Coming here almost makes me feel human
myself. 
RIKER: I didn't believe these simulations could be this real. 
DATA: Much of it is real, sir. If the transporters can convert our
bodies to an energy beam, then back to the original pattern again 
RIKER: Yes, of course. And these rocks and vegetation have much simpler
patterns. 
DATA: Correct, sir. The rear wall. 
RIKER: I can't see it. 
DATA: We're right next to it. 
(He throws a rock at it, and the image pixilates on impact) 
RIKER: Incredible! 
WESLEY [OC]: Commander Riker! 
WESLEY: (at the stream) Commander Riker, isn't this great? This is one
of the simpler patterns. They've got thousands more. Some you just
can't believe. 
RIKER: Careful, the next rock is loose! 
(Wesley falls in the water) 
RIKER: Wesley! 
(Data rushes down and hauls the boy out with one hand) 
WESLEY: Wow! 
[Corridor]

RIKER: Mister Data has agreed to join me on the
away team, Captain. 
PICARD: Very good, Commander. 
WESLEY: Sir, maybe I should get something to wipe this water up. 
PICARD: Good idea.

[Sickbay]

WESLEY: There's a low gravity gymnasium, too. It'd
be hard to get bored on this ship. 
CRUSHER: Good. 
WESLEY: Mom, could you get me a look at the Bridge? 
CRUSHER: That's against the Captain's standing orders. 
WESLEY: Are you afraid of the Captain too? 
CRUSHER: I certainly am not. 
WESLEY: But Captain Picard is a pain, isn't he? 
CRUSHER: Your father liked him very much. Great explorers are often
lonely. No chance to have a family. 
WESLEY: Just a look, at the Bridge. I'll stay in the turbolift when the
doors open. I won't get off. 
CRUSHER: You are asking for trouble, Wes. We'll see what we can do.
