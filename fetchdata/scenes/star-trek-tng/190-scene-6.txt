DATA: Commander, I am picking up some unusual
readings from the Alpha Omicron system. At this range, all I am able to
discern
is that it is an asymmetrical field of intense energy. 
RIKER: What type of radiation signature? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. The Alpha Omicron system is yet to be charted. I
recommend we take this opportunity for further research. 
RIKER: Well, we're way ahead of schedule. Alter course for Alpha
Omicron.

LAFORGE: Doctor Brahms, there's no reason for us to
argue. We're on the same side here. 
LEAH: I'm aware of that. 
LAFORGE: So, why don't I take you on a little tour, show you the
adjustments I've made, why I think they work and we can begin pulling
together on this? Okay. Then why not start with the dilithium chamber.
Okay? 
LEAH: Okay.

DATA: The anomaly is orbiting the seventh planet,
sir. It is a mass of plasma energy contained within discrete boundaries
by an outer covering of silicates, actinides, and carbonaceous
chondrites. 
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. Is it a ship? 
WORF: It does not conform to any known design. 
RIKER: Any records of similar phenomena in Starfleet listings? 
DATA: None, sir. This has never been seen before. 
PICARD: Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter impulse. 
RAGER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Put us in orbit of the seventh planet. Keep us at a relative
distance of ten kilometres from the object. 
RIKER: Alert science stations to standby. Tell them to coordinate all
efforts with Commander Data. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
