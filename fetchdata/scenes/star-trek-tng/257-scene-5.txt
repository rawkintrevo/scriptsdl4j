[Bridge]

(science station) 
DATA: I have completed my analysis of the signal from the mercenary
ship. I believe these groupings represent bearings and coordinates
taken from their navigational system. 
LAFORGE: So you think this is their flight plan? 
DATA: Yes. If I am correct, the mercenary ship is heading toward these
coordinates in the Hyralan Sector. 
WORF: Their maximum speed is warp eight point seven. It will take them
at least fourteen hours to reach that position. 
LAFORGE: We could be there in five. 
DATA: Make it so. 
WORF: Finally. Set course for the Hyralan Sector and engage at warp
nine. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Lieutenant, may I see you in the ready room? 
WORF: Of course.

[Ready room]

DATA: Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with your
performance as First Officer. 
WORF: May I ask in what way? 
DATA: You continually question my orders in front of the crew. I do not
believe this is appropriate behaviour. 
WORF: With all due respect, sir, I have always felt free to voice my
opinions even when they differ from those of Captain Picard or
Commander Riker. 
DATA: That is true. But in those situations, you were acting as Head of
Security, not as First Officer. The primary role of the second in
command is to carry out the decisions of the Captain in this case, me. 
WORF: But is it not my duty to offer you alternatives? 
DATA: Yes. But once I have made a decision, it is your job to carry it
out regardless of how you may personally feel. Any further objections
should be given to me in private, not in front of the crew. I do not
recall Commander Riker ever publicly showing irritation with his
Captain as you did a moment ago. 
WORF: No, sir. 
DATA: If you do not feel capable of carrying out this role, I will
assign it to Commander La Forge and return you to Tactical. I would not
enter it into your record as a reprimand, simply as a transfer. 
WORF: I would prefer to remain at my current post. 
DATA: Then I expect you to conform to the guidelines I have laid out. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Dismissed. Mister Worf, I am sorry if I have ended our
friendship. 
WORF: Sir, it is I who has jeopardised our friendship, not you. If you
will overlook this incident, I would like to continue to consider you
my friend. 
DATA: I would like that as well. 
WORF: Thank you, sir.
