[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge, I'd like you to
monitor our velocity closely. LAFORGE: Is everything all right up
there, Captain? 
PICARD [OC]: Are the engines operating normally? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Everything looks fine down here. 
PICARD [OC]: We're increasing to warp two. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We should be seeing stars by now. Data, how
far have we come? 
DATA: Inertial guidance shows one point four parsecs travelled,
Captain. 
PICARD: Ensign? 
WESLEY: Confirmed, sir. Exactly what my readings say. 
(Geordi enters) 
LAFORGE: Engineering, transfer to Bridge. What's happening, sir? we
should be clear. 
RIKER: We should be. We're on a reverse course. 
PICARD: Full stop, helm. 
WESLEY: Full stop, sir. 
PICARD: According to this we're already well past the point at which we
entered the void. 
DATA: Except that we are still in it, sir. Captain, if we dropped a
stationary beacon and travelled straight away from it, we would have a
fixed point of reference to confirm speed and distance. 
PICARD: Make it so, Data. Lock onto the beacon. Keep it dead astern. 
DATA: The beacon is in place, Captain. 
(a regular sound like the bell of a buoy is heard) 
PICARD: Dead ahead. Impulse power. 
DATA: The beacon is falling astern, Captain. 
PICARD: Engineering, report. 
LAFORGE: All systems functioning normally, sir. 
PICARD: Prepare to increase to warp two. 
(the bell gets further away) 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Captain, we are receiving a signal from dead ahead. 
(and the bell returns, getting louder) 
PULASKI: Maybe you've found the door out of this. 
DATA: Closing on the new signal, sir. 
PICARD: Identify. 
DATA: Captain, it is the stationary beacon we just released. 
RIKER: We must have come full circle, sir. 
WESLEY: We couldn't have, sir. I've shown us steadily moving away from
that beacon. 
PICARD: Full stop. Hold this position again. 
WORF: Captain, sensors indicate a disturbance in sector one zero eight.
Possibly a vessel. 
PICARD: Perhaps some answers at last. On screen. 
WORF: The ship is equipped with a cloaking device. 
RIKER: Romulan! 
WORF: It's closing. 
RIKER: Shields up. Go to Red Alert! 
PULASKI: I'll be at my duty station. 
WORF: Main viewer locked onto coordinates. 
RIKER: Arm the photon torpedoes, Mister Worf. 
PICARD: Hold for my orders. 
WESLEY: There! 
WORF: It's uncloaking. 
(A Romulan warbird shimmers into view and fires. The Enterprise
shudders) 
WORF: Direct hit, sir. Our shields are weakening. 
PICARD: Warn them we'll return fire. 
WORF: Transmitting. They've armed another full spread, sir. 
PICARD: Fire torpedoes. 
(A single torpedo blows the warbird to atoms) 
PICARD: Oh, that was too easy. 
DATA: Captain, sensors can locate no debris from the Romulan ship. 
RIKER: Impossible. 
WORF: Captain, there's another vessel approaching in sector zero nine
one, mark two six. 
PICARD: On screen. Magnify. 
RIKER: It's a Federation ship. NCC one three zero five dash E. It's the
Yamato, our sister ship. 
WESLEY: The Yamato's nowhere near this quadrant. 
PICARD: Open a hailing frequency, Data. 
DATA: USS Enterprise to USS Yamato. Respond, please. USS Enterprise
calling USS Yamato. Respond, please, on this frequency. No response,
Captain. 
PICARD: Make a full scan. 
DATA: Life support system, engineering and propulsion all appear
functional. But there are no life signs, sir. 
PICARD: Data, can we be getting a false reading? 
DATA: Since we know nothing of these circumstances, it is at least
conceivable, sir. 
RIKER: You look doubtful, sir. 
PICARD: I'm not anything now, Number One. I'm just a man who's looking
for answers. 
LAFORGE: Like the rat said, 'Keep the cheese, I just want out of the
trap.' 
RIKER: Captain, request permission to board on the Yamato with an away
team. Perhaps something we can find on board in the logs will help us
figure out what happened. 
PICARD: Granted. Minimum complement. 
RIKER: Worf, you're with me.

Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a fly
in amber, trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which
appears to be the USS Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning,
yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team.
Hopefully, the answer lies over there.
