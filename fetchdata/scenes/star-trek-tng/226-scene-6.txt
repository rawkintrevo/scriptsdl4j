RIKER: We're in orbit. 
PICARD: Any sign of life? 
WORF: Negative, sir. 
DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance
on a small area of the planet's surface. Forty two degrees seven
minutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east. 
RIKER: Temporal disturbance? 
PICARD: Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates. 
DATA: Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating
from the same location. 
RIKER: Any correlation with the readings from Earth? 
DATA: Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical to the one
found in the cavern. 
PICARD: Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids? 
DATA: Only with long term exposure, sir. There is no immediate threat. 
PICARD: Take an away team. 
RIKER: Worf. Geordi. Troi. Join me in transporter room three for an
away team. 
DATA: Commander. 
PICARD: Mister Data, I'll need your help to monitor the sensor readings
during this investigation. 
(the away team enter the turbolift) 
DATA: Captain, may I speak to you alone?

[Ready room]

DATA: Sir, it is standard procedure that the second
officer accompany the away team. 
PICARD: Yes, yes, Mister Data, I am aware of that. 
DATA: Then I must assume your decision is related to the discovery on
Earth of 
PICARD: I think it is reasonable to take precautions. 
DATA: Captain, there is no rational justification for this course. 
PICARD: Then I'll be irrational. 
DATA: It is possible, sir, that the events leading to my death will not
occur for years, even centuries. 
PICARD: I hope that's true, Mister Data. Nevertheless, this
investigation began with your death. I am simply trying to see that it
doesn't end that way. 
DATA: I appreciate your concern, Captain, but, to employ an aphorism,
one cannot cheat fate. 
PICARD: Cheat fate? Perhaps we can't, Mister Data. But at least we can
give it a try.
