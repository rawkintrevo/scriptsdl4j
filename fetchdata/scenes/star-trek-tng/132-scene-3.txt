WESLEY RIKER PICARD

[Bridge]

RIKER: Reduce to half impulse. 
WESLEY: Reducing velocity to one half impulse. 
[Ready room]

(Picard has a holographic representation of a solar
system over his desk, with some very erratic orbits in it) 
PICARD: Come. Ah, Number One. Look at this. Ever since we left the Lima
Sierra system, I have been puzzling over how the third planet could
maintain such an orbit, when it is theoretically impossible. But
consider this. 
RIKER: There's no degeneration. 
PICARD: Exactly. 
RIKER: Why? 
PICARD: Why? I haven't a clue. 
RIKER: Perhaps this facsimile lacks the proper mass. 
PICARD: Perhaps, but if this is an accurate representation, it could
explain what happened in that system. 
RIKER: Perhaps. 
PICARD: Well, not a matter of great moment, just a knot I had to untie.
So, what do you want to see me about? 
RIKER: We've arrived at Ramatis Three. 
PICARD: Oh well, time to leave. 

[Bridge]

RIKER: Standard orbit, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Standard orbit. 
PICARD: Mister Data, you have the Bridge.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Transporter room five. I'm still a little
uncomfortable with your leading this away team. 
PICARD: This is not an away team, Commander. I consider this a
ceremonial function. For me not to go could be construed as lack of
interest. 
RIKER: You will be careful, sir 
PICARD: Oh, cluck, cluck, Number One. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: You're being a mother hen. I appreciate your concern. Actually
I'm looking forward to meeting this mediator. 
RIKER: We came a long way to get him. 
PICARD: They wanted the best. That, according to all reports, is Riva.
