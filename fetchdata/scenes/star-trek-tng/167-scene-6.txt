[Ready room]

RIKER: Is something wrong, Captain? 
PICARD: Tell me, Number One, is the entire crew aware of this little
scheme to send me off on holiday? 
RIKER: I believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty nine
who know nothing about it. 
PICARD: I suppose this means I can look forward to a week of continual
harassment on this subject? (signs) I admit, I've been feeling a little
fatigued.

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is in casual clothes - brown trousers and
light blue top, if you really want to know) 
RIKER: I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room,
sir. 
TROI: You look very handsome, if I might saying so Captain. 
RIKER: Are you taking all these books? 
PICARD: I thought I'd take some light reading in case I got bored. 
RIKER: Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics, Sophistry and the Alternate
Universe by Ving Kuda. You call that light reading? 
PICARD: To each his own, Number One. 
RIKER: Have I mentioned how imaginative the Risian women are, sir? 
TROI: Too often, Commander.
