BOOTHBY PICARD CADET LOCARNO SITO

[Academy gardens]

(Picard strolls across the Japanese bridge) 
BOOTHBY [OC]: Hey! Can't you see that's a flower bed? 
CADET [OC]: Sorry. I'm really sorry. 
(A cadet has been sitting under a tree. The old gardener goes to repair
the damage caused) 
PICARD: Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard, class of twenty seven. 
BOOTHBY: I know that. What happened to your hair? 
PICARD: How are you? 
BOOTHBY: I'm pretty damned cranky, thank you. I've already replanted
this bed four times this week. 
PICARD: Let me give you a hand. 
BOOTHBY: You? 
PICARD: I've acquired an interest over the years. 
BOOTHBY: Well, don't plant 'em too deep. The stems 
PICARD: Will rot. 
BOOTHBY: Captain Picard. Of the Enterprise, no less. And giving the
commencement address. 
PICARD: You sound surprised. 
BOOTHBY: Surprised? Uh, uh. Nothing you ever did surprised me, son.
Except that time you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift and
pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match. Didn't think you
had it in you. 
PICARD: Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby. 
BOOTHBY: Hmmm? 
PICARD: I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much I
appreciate. 
BOOTHBY: There's nothing to tell. 
(They go walking) 
PICARD: Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, you
know as well as I do I would never have graduated if you 
BOOTHBY: You made a mistake. There isn't a man among us who hasn't been
young enough to make one. 
PICARD: Nevertheless. 
BOOTHBY: You did what you had to do. You did what you thought was best.
I just made sure that you listened to yourself. 
PICARD: At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious old
man. 
BOOTHBY: I was. And by the way, I was about the same age you are now. 
PICARD: I didn't speak to you for months. 
BOOTHBY: You needed to get your bearings. I knew that. The important
thing is, what you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did okay.
That's thanks enough for me. 
PICARD: Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed? 
BOOTHBY: Josh Albert? Yeah. Crusher, Hajar, Sito, Locarno. I know them
all.

[Wesley's room]

(Locarno is inspecting his troops) 
LOCARNO: You nervous? 
SITO: (a Bajoran woman) No. Yes. 
LOCARNO: That's okay. So am I. But we're going to be all right. We've
got some tough times ahead but we've always come through for each
other. Whatever happens, I want you all to know that leading this team
has been the high point of my years at the Academy. No one could have
asked for a better team, or better friends. Let's go.
