WORF: Captain, look at this. The force of the
energy field around the shuttlecraft decreased for a few moments when
the creature was draped over it. 
PICARD: But not low enough to beam them out. 
WORF: Almost. 
WESLEY: It's approaching the away team now, and the energy field over
the shuttlecraft is back to full intensity. 
PICARD: Chart it. I want to see if there's a pattern. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

ARMUS: She said you'd be back. 
RIKER: Then she is alive. 
ARMUS: For now. Why have you returned? 
RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What do
you want? 
ARMUS: Maybe I want nothing. 
RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. 
ARMUS: I still might. 
RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. 
ARMUS: If I tell you, will you give it to me? 
RIKER: I might. It depends. 
CRUSHER: I am a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends. 
ARMUS: Say please. 
CRUSHER: Please. 
ARMUS: You ask nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind.
Talk to her from here. 
CRUSHER: How? Troi, can you hear me?

TROI: Beverly?
