[Fajo's den]

(It's a large, clean room with ornamentation
arranged on display around the walls and a red circular seat in the
middle. The rigid Data is currently laid across it. He suddenly reboots
and sits up. His communicator is gone) 
DATA: What am I doing here? 
(Fajo and Varria enter) 
GUEST1: Wondrous. The detail. The balance. Was I not right, Varria? What
a remarkable piece of work. 
DATA: Why have I been brought here? 
GUEST1: The voice simulation. it's perfection. The inflections, the
timing. 
(Fajo snaps his fingers to test Data's responses, then speaks to him as
if Data does not understand English, complete with gestures) 
GUEST1: It took great effort. Effort. to bring you here. I was sure he'd
be worth it. I was right. 
DATA: I've been delivered here against my wishes. I would like to know
the reason. 
GUEST1: Certainly. You have been brought here for my enjoyment and my
appreciation. 
DATA: Am I to infer that you intend to keep me captive? 
GUEST1: Captive? Captive? That's such an inappropriate description. My
dear android. May I call you Data? 
DATA: It is my name. 
GUEST1: Data. You will be catered to, fawned over, cared for as you never
have been before. Your every wish will be fulfilled 
DATA: I wish to leave. 
GUEST1: Almost every wish. 
DATA: This is unacceptable, sir. I have no desire to remain here and
even if I did, my Starfleet duties would not allow it. 
GUEST1: It's so single minded, isn't it? 
GUEST0: Very persistent. 
GUEST1: But it's very polite, which is a very nice touch. I decline to
allow you to go. 
DATA: Then I am forced to attempt escape. 
(Data tries to force the door open) 
GUEST1: Ten androids just like you might be able to force that thing
open. But then again, there aren't any more just like you, are there?
It's keyed to galvanic skin responses and DNA patterns. Sorry. 
DATA: Then you will have to open it for me. 
(But as soon as Data gets to almost arms reach of Fajo, he is stopped
by a green forcefield. He tries again at a run and is thrown back
across the room) 
GUEST1: Oh. Really, I wouldn't do that again if I were you. This is a
proximity-actuated field. It impedes positron flow.
It's very bad for the brainpaths in the long term. 
DATA: I fail to understand the value you place on my presence. 
GUEST1: Well, just look around the room. There are items her gathered
from half the galaxy. Right here. This is the very first Basotile ever
created. (a sort of avant-guard sculpture) Sorry. (Fajo moves so Data
can see it) It's very, very ancient. Hundreds of years old. It's
priceless. 
(He goes past a beautiful porcelain urn on a stand to an orange
rectangular thing) 
GUEST1: Come. This vase is made by Mark, the late Mark Off-Zel from
Sirrie Four. (painting) Dali. This is the only known Roger Maris
trading card from Earth circa 1962. The smell? Bubblegum. I've
preserved the scent. What? A Lapling. 
(A glove puppet with huge blue eyes in a case) 
DATA: I thought they were extinct. 
GUEST1: Extinct? Good. That is what is generally believed. She is the
last surviving member of her species. They're very defenseless
creatures, really.
Everything that you see in the room here, everything. One of its kind.
Unique. All original. Just as you are. There. (a chair) That is your
place of honour. Sit, sit. Sit! You think perhaps it might be
uncomfortable? But then again, you don't give a thought to comfort, do
you. (to Varria) When Palor Toff learns of that, he'll swallow his
tongue with envy. I can't wait to see his face. You are the crown jewel
of my
collection. You're a treasure beyond comparison. 
(The comm. beeps) 
GUEST0: Yes, go ahead. 
GUEST1: I think you should be flattered. 
DATA: I am not, sir. Most intelligent lifeforms find involuntary
confinement offensive and inequitable. Moreover, you have
violated Federation law 
GUEST1: I know, I know. What I've done is evil, selfish, immoral,
unprincipled, illegal. Well, I've learned to live with it. 
GUEST0: The Andorians wish to make a bid on the shipment of Tellurian
spices you offered. 
GUEST1: They've had four days to decide! Why do they have to decide
right! Sorry. 
DATA: I must emphasize, Mister Fajo, that I consider this captivity a
hostile act on your part. 
GUEST1: You'll get used to it.
