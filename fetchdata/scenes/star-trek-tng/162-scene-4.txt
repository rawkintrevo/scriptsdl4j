[Transporter room]

(A humanoid male, hair swept up at the sides to
give a severe look) 
WORF: I'm Lieutenant Worf, head of ship's Security. I will take you to
the Captain.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Chief Investigator, welcome to the
Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. This is my First Officer, Commander
William Riker. 
KRAG: Commander Riker, I am here to take you into custody. 
RIKER: Custody? On what charge? 
KRAG: Suspicion of murder. 
RIKER: Murder? Now wait a minute, you can't come on 
PICARD: Chief Investigator, we are perfectly willing to cooperate with
you, but 
KRAG: Then release the prisoner for transportation to the planet. 
PICARD: Let's continue this discussion in private. Number One, you have
the Bridge.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Just what is the evidence against my
officer? 
KRAG: Two witnesses have come forward to describe Commander Riker's
threats against Doctor Apgar. 
PICARD: Threats? I'm aware there was a private conversation between
them. 
KRAG: Apparently, it was much more than just a private conversation,
but he will have a chance to prove his innocence. 
PICARD: Investigator, in our system of jurisprudence, a man is innocent
until proved guilty. 
KRAG: In ours, he is guilty until he is proved innocent, and you are
under our jurisdiction. If I understand the Federation
regulations on these matters, and I just happened to look them up
before I 
PICARD: I am aware of Federation regulations, sir, and if you
investigate them further, you will find the captain decides if
extradition is warranted. 
KRAG: Are you saying it is not? 
PICARD: I'm saying, if there is sufficient cause to warrant a trial, I
will release my officer into your custody. 
KRAG: Would you say you're close to your First Officer, Captain? 
PICARD: That question is irrelevant here. 
KRAG: Really, Captain, you cannot believe that. How can I expect a fair
and impartial decision? 
PICARD: I must protect the rights of my officer. 
KRAG: I can appreciate that, but you will do it on the planet, not
here. After all, what if you were suddenly to decide to leave this star
system? 
PICARD: You have my word as a Starfleet officer that I will not. 
KRAG: Unacceptable. Captain, you will turn him over to me for
interrogation now. 
PICARD: Interrogate him here. 
KRAG: We must recreate, step by step, moment by moment, all the events
leading to the explosion. We will require access to all the witnesses,
as well as the data from the lab's ground computers. It would be
impossible to accomplish here. 
PICARD: Perhaps not. Mister Data, will you report to my Ready Room? 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: We may be able to assist you in recreating the events. 
(Data enters) 
PICARD: Commander Data, this is Chief Investigator Krag. Commander, by
taking testimony from the away team and from witnesses provided by the
Investigator, would it be possible to programme the Holodeck to
recreate what happened on the science station? 
DATA: It would require construction and design specifications, full
orthographic representations of the Krieger equipment, as well as
visual representations and voice analyses of the persons involved. But
it is possible. 
KRAG: Very well. Arrangements will be made to provide you with all
available information. I shall return shortly with our witnesses. 
PICARD: Commander, will you escort Investigator Krag to Transporter
Room Three.
