PICARD BOK CRUSHER VOICES

[Picard's quarters]

(the doorbell chimes) 
PICARD: Yes? Who the hell is it? 
(Crusher enters.) 
CRUSHER: Not resting, Captain? 
PICARD: More like dying, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Over here. 
PICARD: What is wrong with me? 
CRUSHER: I wish to hell I knew, Captain, but something unusual has
definitely been happening to you. 
PICARD: Why do doctors always say the obvious as though it's a
revelation? 
CRUSHER: Why do captains always act like they're immortal? 
(she tries another painkiller) 
PICARD: No.

[Picard's Quarters]

CRUSHER: You didn't tell me it had been this bad. 
PICARD: It wasn't this bad. But it's getting worse. 
CRUSHER: This should help a little. It's got to be some kind of
emotional pressure connected with the Stargazer. 
PICARD: I got this headache long before I even knew my old ship still
existed. Still, perhaps you're partly right. 
CRUSHER: Want to talk about it? I'm here. 
PICARD: The fight at Maxia. I destroyed an entire vessel. An entire
crew. 
CRUSHER: Did you have a choice? 
PICARD: I don't know anymore. I just don't know. 
CRUSHER: Commander Riker's told me about the altered log, if that's
what's troubling you. 
PICARD: The last three nights I've, I've heard these voices. I'm on the
bridge of my old ship. There's fire all around me. The klaxons, smoke.
And then I give the order. And now the Stargazer is really here!. And
that log. Am I going crazy? How do I know I was in my right mind at
Maxia? How do I know I'm in my right mind now? 
(Crusher gives him an injection) 
PICARD: What was that? 
CRUSHER: Something to let you sleep. 
(She helps him to his bed) 
PICARD: Yes sleep. Sleep. 
(Crusher puts two small devices on his forehead, turns the lights out
and leaves) 
VOICES [OC]: Shields weakening, Captain. Torpedoes armed. Where are
they? 
[Ferengi Science Lab]

BOK: And now, dear Captain, you are ready to live
the past. 
(He winds the contraption up to maximum)
