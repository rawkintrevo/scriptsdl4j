[Market place]

TASHA: Recommend that someone could begin by
examining the underside of the station, sir. 
TROI: Our sensors do show some passages, sir. Perhaps you and I? 
RIKER: Tasha, you and the Counsellor. And, Geordi, I want your eyes
down there. (to Data) You and I will start with topside. 
(As the three explore underground) 
RIKER: Have you noticed anything unusual? 
DATA: I can't see as well as Geordi, sir, but so far the material seems
rather very ordinary. 
RIKER: Construction records? 
DATA: Construction records show this to be almost identical to that
which Starfleet uses. 
TASHA [OC]: Team Leader. 
[Passageway]

TASHA: We've found something interesting. We're in
a passageway directly under the station, sir. 
LAFORGE: But these tunnel walls are something I've never seen before,
sir. 
[Marketplace]

RIKER: How are you examining them? 
LAFORGE [OC]: In every way. 
[Passageway]

LAFORGE: Microscopically, thermally,
electromagnetically. None of it is familiar.
RIKER [OC]: What about you, Troi? 
TROI: Sir, I've avoided opening my mind. Whatever I felt in the
Groppler's office became very uncomfortable.
