CRUSHER LAFORGE

[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: At first I thought the catwalk was
spinning. As it turns out, it was me. Luckily Ensign Fletcher was there
to grab me. It's a long way down to the bottom of the warp core. 
CRUSHER: You have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection. That
would explain the dizziness and the headaches. But there's no physical
evidence. My guess is you've been working too hard. 
LAFORGE: I have been putting a lot of extra hours on this Typhon
Expanse project. 
CRUSHER: I'll give you twenty cc's of vertazine. That should clear up
the dizziness. But finding time to relax is up to you. 
LAFORGE: What? What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi, have you had these symptoms before? 
LAFORGE: No. 
CRUSHER: You're sure? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm positive. Why? 
CRUSHER: It's funny. I feel like we've discussed this before, and I
remember giving you a hypospray for dizziness. 
LAFORGE: I've never had these symptoms before today, so you must be
thinking about another patient. 
CRUSHER: No. I'm sure it was you. Well, try to get some rest, and try
to stay away from high places for a few days, just in case. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Doc. 
CRUSHER: Goodnight. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight.

(Beverly is dead-heading a plant and sipping on a
night-cap. She goes over to the bed, turns out the lights and puts down
the glass. Once she's settled down, she starts hearing lots voices all
jumbled up. As she reaches to put on the lights again, she knocks over
the glass, and it breaks)
