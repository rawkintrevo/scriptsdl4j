[Holodeck]

(There is no programme running) 
WORF: Ensign, what are you doing on the holodeck? I thought you were
still on Relva Seven. 
WESLEY: I'm finished testing for the day. 
WORF: I've disturbed you. I'll leave. 
WESLEY: Wait. I thought I wanted to be alone, but I guess I don't. 
WORF: How is the testing? 
WESLEY: Okay. So far. It's not the ones that I've studied for that I'm
worried about. It's the psych test. Facing my deepest fear and living
through it. I'm trying to figure out what images to bring up. 
WORF: Why? 
WESLEY: I guess I want to scare myself. What do you think? Bulgallian
rats? Lightning storms? 
WORF: Do those things frighten you? 
WESLEY: Sort of, I guess. 
WORF: The psych test is no more or less important than the rest of the
process. 
WESLEY: That's what they said, but I can't stop thinking about it. 
WORF: Thinking about what you can't control only wastes your energy and
creates its own enemy. 
WESLEY: How can they know what my deepest fear is when I don't? 
WORF: By analysing your psychological profile. They were very accurate
about everyone I tested with. Including myself. 
WESLEY: You? I thought there was nothing that could frighten a Klingon
warrior. 
WORF: Only fools have no fear. 
WESLEY: I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I'm asking too many personal questions. 
WORF: It is very difficult for me to depend on anyone for anything. But
especially for my life. 
WESLEY: But on the Enterprise you do that every day. Everyone depends
on everyone else to protect them. 
WORF: Yes. 
WESLEY: So you overcame it? 
WORF: No. It is still my enemy. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: With this new extricator, sir, we can
eliminate three more bulky machines from cargo space. 
PICARD: That's excellent, Number One. 
TASHA: Captain, there's an unauthorised entry in main Shuttlebay.

PICARD: Who is it, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Computer reads the ID number of Jake Kurland. Bridge to main
Shuttlebay. Mister Kurland, this is Lieutenant Yar. Respond. 
REMMICK: Isn't the area secured? 
RIKER: Not now, Remmick. He's going to take this out, Captain. 
TASHA: I'm locking off the bay launch doors, Captain. 
WORF: Too late. He's using the flight emergency override 
LAFORGE: Smart kid. 
REMMICK: Kid? 
TASHA: He's launching. 
PICARD: On viewer. lieutenant Yar, open channel. Enterprise to
shuttlecraft. Mister Kurland, this is Captain Picard. Mister Kurland. 
JAKE [OC]: Captain, I'm going to Beltane Nine

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: To sign onto a freighter. Tell my father I'm
sorry.
