[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: To begin the first illumination test. 
RIKER: Acknowledged. All science stations, stand by. We're about to
light up the nebula. Mister Worf? 
WORF: Launch bay one shows ready, Commander. 
RIKER: Fire torpedo.

[Torpedo bay]

(the bright light glows in the purple nebula) 
GUEST2: It's beautiful. Like watching fireworks when I was a little
girl.

[Ten Forward]

(a quintet is playing. Data on oboe, Jenna on
flute, Keiko on clarinet, an alien on bassoon, and a man in casual
clothes on French horn) 
O'BRIEN: That was wonderful. 
KEIKO: Thank you. 
(Miles and Keiko embrace) 
GUEST1: Really wonderful. 
DATA: Is anything wrong? 
GUEST2: My tempo was way off. I felt like I was rushing through the
whole piece. 
DATA: I do not believe that is so. Your rhythmic control has improved
markedly. I heard no fluctuations during the performance. 
GUEST2: Well, maybe, but I ruined the coda. I got confused with the
phrasing again. I kept breathing at the wrong times. 
DATA: The contrapuntal nature of the composition is most demanding. We
will give more attention to the rhythmic patterns at our next
rehearsal. However, I am quite certain the audience was oblivious to
such nuances. They seemed to enjoy the performance thoroughly. 
GUEST2: Thank you, Data. You're very generous. 
(later, at a table) 
KEIKO: Every night, Miles leaves his socks on the floor. When we got
married, I made the mistake of picking them up a few times. Then I
realised, if I kept it up I'd be doing it the rest of my life. So I
stopped, figuring he'd get the point and do it himself. One night goes
by, two, a week, ten days. By now there's a pile of socks half a metre
high. 
O'BRIEN: Come on, it wasn't half a metre. 
KEIKO: After two weeks I couldn't stand it any more. I bundled them up
and put them in the cleaning processor. And I'm still doing it. 
O'BRIEN: And a very good job she does of it, too. 
GUEST2: Keiko, you sound just like Data. He came over to my quarters the
other day to give me a music lesson, and he said the funniest thing.
How did you put it, about the mess? 
DATA: I believe I observed that you seem to have an aversion to
orderliness. But it was not intended as a humourous remark. 
GUEST2: So, before we started, he gallantly offered to help me
straighten up. 
DATA: And a very good job of it I did of it, too. 
(and Jenna hangs onto his arm, and gazes at him like Keiko gazes at
Miles)
