JELLICO RIKER LAFORGE
inspire oh make nebula day going close hell casual

[Shuttlecraft]

JELLICO: Been awhile since I flew one of these.
You're a pilot yourself, aren't you Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
JELLICO: I began my career as a shuttle pilot, on the Jovian run.
Jupiter to Saturn and back once a day, every day. 
LAFORGE: Is that right? I was on that run myself for a while. 
JELLICO: Then you must've done Titan's Turn. 
LAFORGE: Oh, yeah. You set a course directly for Titan, hold it until
you're just brushing the atmosphere, throw the helm hard over and whip
around the moon at point seven c. 
JELLICO: And pray like hell nobody saw you. 
LAFORGE: You know, this trip into the nebula's going to need someone
who can do Titan's Turn in their sleep. These mines need to be laid
within two kilometres of the Cardassian ships. But the particle flux
from the nebula will blind all the sensors except for this proximity
detector. You're going to need one heck of a pilot to pull that off. 
JELLICO: Is that you? 
LAFORGE: I could do it, but truthfully, the man you want is Commander
Riker. He's the best there is.

[Riker's quarters]

(Riker is in casual clothes, reading, when the
doorbell rings) 
RIKER: Come in. 
JELLICO: Am I disturbing you? 
RIKER: Not at all. 
JELLICO: Musician. 
RIKER: Yes. 
JELLICO: Classical? Contemporary? 
RIKER: Jazz. 
JELLICO: Ah. 
RIKER: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? 
JELLICO: Are you aware of our plans to attack the Cardassian invasion
fleet? 
RIKER: Yes, sir. I understand you've been talking to every shuttle
pilot on board. 
JELLICO: Let's drop the ranks for a moment. I don't like you. I think
you're insubordinate, arrogant. wilful, and I don't think you're a
particularly good first officer. But you are also the best pilot on the
ship. 
RIKER: Well, now that the ranks are dropped, Captain, I don't like you,
either. You are arrogant and closed-minded. You need to control
everything and everyone. You don't provide an atmosphere of trust, and
you don't inspire these people to go out of their way for you. You've
get everybody wound up so tight there's no joy in anything. I don't
think you're a particularly good Captain. 
JELLICO: I won't order you to fly this mission. I'm here to ask. 
RIKER: Then ask me. 
JELLICO: Will you pilot the shuttle, Commander? 
RIKER: Yes. 
(Jellico starts to leave) 
RIKER: You're welcome.

[Shuttlecraft]

LAFORGE: We've lost primary navigation. Switching
to secondary systems. 
RIKER: Inertial dampers compensating. 
LAFORGE: Sensors inoperative. 
RIKER: Right on schedule. 
LAFORGE: The proximity detector is working. We should be able to read
their ships at a distance of five hundred metres. 
RIKER: Don't make this too easy. 
(Geordi goes to the rear as the detector starts beeping) 
RIKER: Hang on. 
LAFORGE: Do I want to know how close that was? 
RIKER: No. Get ready to deploy the mines.
