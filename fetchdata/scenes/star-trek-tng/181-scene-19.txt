[Observation lounge]

(K'Ehleyr is working alone when Gowron of the
bug-eyes enters) 
K'EHLEYR: The next meeting is in three hours. 
GOWRON: I would speak with you alone, Ambassador. 
K'EHLEYR: I'm honoured. 
GOWRON: Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq. Why? 
K'EHLEYR: He has sufficient reason to proceed carefully. 
GOWRON: He relies on you for his knowledge of Klingon law. 
K'EHLEYR: Yes. 
GOWRON: Then he values your advice. You could quicken the pace. 
K'EHLEYR: Possibly. Why should I? 
GOWRON: Your position is unique. Have you never wondered about serving
the Klingon Empire? 
K'EHLEYR: I serve in my own way. 
GOWRON: As a Federation Ambassador. A few rewards, but little glory. 
K'EHLEYR: What do you want? 
GOWRON: What do you want? Command of a ship? A seat on the Council?
There are many opportunities for you in the Empire. 
K'EHLEYR: Opportunities that will present themselves only if you come
to power. You talk like a Ferengi. 
GOWRON: K'mpec was also stubborn. He too refused to listen. Now, he's
gone. You need not make the same mistake. 
K'EHLEYR: K'mpec was old and weak. I am not.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We've completed our analysis of the bomb
debris, Commander. 
DATA: The explosive was a triceron derivative. 
LAFORGE: And the entire device couldn't have been more than three cubic
millimetres in size. 
RIKER: It could have been hidden anywhere in that room. 
LAFORGE: There's one more thing. The bomb had a molecular-decay
detonator. 
DATA: Only one race uses that device, sir. 
RIKER: The Romulans.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: How could the Romulans plant a bomb on
board a Klingon attack cruiser? 
WORF: It would be impossible. 
K'EHLEYR: Not if the Romulans had help from one of the Klingons. 
LAFORGE: Klingons and Romulans working together? They've been blood
enemies for seventy five years. 
PICARD: Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve that relationship. 
RIKER: A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans? 
DATA: If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the
quadrant. 
PICARD: Indeed. It would put the Federation in a very difficult
position. 
RIKER: Duras or Gowron? 
K'EHLEYR: Gowron came to me alone. He wanted me to speed up the
ja'chuq. Offered me a seat on the Council if I'd help him. 
PICARD: That doesn't suggest a Romulan connection? 
K'EHLEYR: He also implied I'd end up like K'mpec if I didn't cooperate.

WORF: Captain, I disagree. It must be Duras. 
K'EHLEYR: Why? 
PICARD: We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to be
untrustworthy. 
K'EHLEYR: Can you be more specific? 
PICARD: No. Mister Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that could
be a direct threat to the security of the Federation. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the next
transition proceeding. 
WORF: Captain, they will be incensed. My presence will be disruptive. 
PICARD: Yes, it will.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Computer, list stardates of the last
Enterprise mission to the Klingon home planet. 
COMPUTER: Stardates 43685 through 43689. 
K'EHLEYR: How many ship's logs during that period? 
COMPUTER: Forty three officer's logs. Ten personal logs. 
K'EHLEYR: Is there a personal log for Lieutenant Worf? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Access is restricted. 
K'EHLEYR: Eliminate all personal logs. List the remaining forty three
in chronological order. We'll just take them one at a time.
