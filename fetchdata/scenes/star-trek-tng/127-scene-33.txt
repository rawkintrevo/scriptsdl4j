[Pulaski's office]

DATA: Aye, sir. Excuse me, Doctor. 
PULASKI: That's all right. Da(h)ta. Data. Whatever. 
[Children's play area]

(some children are cuddling puppies) 
TROI: Ian? Ian! 
MISS GLADSTONE: He's a very tactile child. He wants to touch and feel
everything. 
TROI: It's time to go, sweetheart. 
MISS GLADSTONE: Unbelievable. I think he's actually grown since you
dropped him off. 
IAN: (getting on for Troi's shoulder height) I like it here, Mommy. 
TROI: I thought you would. Say thank you to Miss Gladstone for having
you, and let's go get something to eat. 
IAN: Thank you. 
BOY: Bye. 
TROI: Thank you.

[Transporter room]

COMPUTER: Bio-transfer authorisation complete. 
O'BRIEN: Cargo deck five, we will commence transportation

[Cargo deck five]

O'BRIEN [OC]: On your command. 
LAFORGE: Transporter three, we are ready to receive. 
(Hexagons start to appear on the display and in the container) 
LAFORGE: Data, the first batch is in place, and we're ready for the
next. 
RIKER: You'll inform me when loading is complete and the cargo secure. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. 
PULASKI: I wanted to stop by and see how Ian was doing. 
TROI: We're doing fine. I was just about to get him his supper. 
IAN: Do you want your supper now, too? 
PICARD: No, Ian, but thank you for the invitation. 
IAN: You're welcome. Have you ever played with puppies? 
TROI: They had a litter today in the nursery. 
PICARD: No, Ian, I don't think I've played with puppies. 
IAN: You should come to the nursery while the puppies are still there. 
PICARD: Perhaps later. 
(Ian puts his finger in his hot soup) 
IAN: Ow! Mom. 
PULASKI: Let me see that. (treats the scald) That's not so bad. 
IAN: My face is wet. 
TROI: Is that better, sweetheart? Everything's going to be fine. 
PULASKI: He allowed himself to be burned. 
PICARD: For the experience. 
PULASKI: Who is he? Why is he here? What does he want? 
PICARD: Ian, could you tell us why you are here? 
IAN: Because Mommy said it was time to eat. 
PICARD: No, I mean, why you are here on this ship? 
IAN: I live here. 
TROI: Ian, I think the Captain wants to know if you are ready to tell
us why you came here. 
IAN: No, not yet. 
TROI: The answer is within him. When his cognitive powers have
sufficiently developed, he will be able to articulate it. 
PICARD: I hope he will tell us soon.
IAN: Bye.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Cargo has been loaded and is secure. 
PICARD: Then take us out of orbit, Number One. Set a course for
Rachelis, warp six.

[Ten forward]

(Wesley is staring out of a window) 
GUINAN: Can I get you something? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. I just like to stand here. 
GUINAN: I don't blame you. It's beautiful. 
WESLEY: Yes. 
GUINAN: How about some nice Mareuvian Tea? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. Thank you. 
GUINAN: You'll be leaving soon. 
WESLEY: Yes. 
GUINAN: What do you see when you look out there? 
WESLEY: The Lorenze cluster, and there Arneb and there Epsilon Indi. 
GUINAN: That's not what I mean. I mean, when you look there, don't you
see your future? 
WESLEY: It'll still be there. 
GUINAN: How about a cup of nectar direct from Prometheus? 
WESLEY: No, nothing. That's the third time you've asked me. 
GUINAN: It's what I'm expected to do. Don't you always do what's
expected? 
WESLEY: I try. 
GUINAN: Even if it's not what you really want? 
WESLEY: Sometimes. Sometimes it's more important to consider others
before yourself. 
GUINAN: Yes. But sometimes the game is to know when to consider
yourself before others. Give yourself permission to be selfish.
