[Engineering]

MACDOUGAL: I can't help you, Bridge! Someone here
has yanked out all the control chips. 
WESLEY: It was an adult who did it! 
[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, I estimate fourteen minutes until that
mass gets here. 
MACDOUGAL [OC]: No way, sir. I cannot replace these chips in fourteen
minutes. Two hours, three 
[Engineering]

MACDOUGAL: Maybe. 
WESLEY: Data could assemble them back faster. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: What, what's that? What's that, Wesley? 
[Engineering]

WESLEY: Well, they're just simple isolinear chips,
sir, to Data anyway. He can shuffle them like cards. 
(Riker hauls the drunken Data to his feet) 
RIKER: Come on, Data, hurry.

Ship's log, First Officer Riker. Enterprise will be
destroyed unless it can be moved out of the
path of the star material hurtling toward us. Our only hope is for
Lieutenant Commander Data, in the time we have left, to regain
his senses and reconnect engine power to the Bridge.

DATA: Nice to see you, Wesley. 
WESLEY: Hi, Mister Data. 
RIKER: No time for courtesy. Get the damned control chips back in
place, in the correct order. Now! 
WESLEY: It's like a game. How fast can you do it? 
DATA: Ah, a game! 
(So, with Red Alert screaming, Data sits down at the panel and starts
slotting chips in, very quickly) 
WESLEY: I think I can switch this to main viewer, sir, 
(Once he sees the reality of the situation, he steps back horrified) 
RIKER: Data, we've got eight or nine minutes at most. Can you finish by
then? 
DATA: No, this will take slightly more time than we have, sir. 
(Riker starts sweating) 
RIKER: Damn it, no. I can't afford to get this.

[Crusher's Office]

(Picard enters with a little skip) 
PICARD: Beverly. 
CRUSHER: Yes, Jean-Luc? 
PICARD: You will address me as Captain. 
CRUSHER: Captain? Well then, my dear Captain, you will address me as
Chief Medical Officer or Doctor. 
PICARD: I will? That's true. I started off calling you Beverly, and of
course, naturally, you. I'm still not thinking straight. 
CRUSHER: Likewise. Where the hell was I headed? 
PICARD: If that's something you were going to test, 
CRUSHER: Yes, on Geordi. Come here. 
[Engineering]

WESLEY: See how I reversed the fields on this,
Commander? I made it into a repulser beam. 
DATA: If we just had one minute more, sir, 
WESLEY: If this were a hundred times more powerful than it is. Why not
try it with the real thing? Why not reverse fields on this, Ma'am? If
we just need an extra minute, 
MACDOUGAL: It would take weeks of laying out new circuits. 
WESLEY: Why not just see it in your head? Come off the main lead, split
off at the force activator, then, then. If I could just think straight
about this, 

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I made this a broader based remedy. I
hope. But it's still close to the formula from the old Enterprise
records. 
PICARD: Decades ago, light years away, 
CRUSHER: But almost exactly the same conditions as here. 
LAFORGE: Wow! What was in that, Doctor? My head's beginning to clear, 
CRUSHER: Come here. (injects Picard, then herself) Here, take this to
Engineering. I'll make up more hypos for the others. 
PICARD: Okay, Bev.
