RIKER: Deanna, I don't know if you can hear me.
I've heard doctors say that even when someone's in a coma, they may be
able to hear when people talk to them. That it might help stimulate the
brain, speed the healing. In fact, I think you did that for me once,
when I was in pretty bad shape. I just thought it might help to hear a
friendly voice, even if you don't know you're hearing it. We've been
busy mapping the sector. It's been pretty routine. The most unusual
thing we've seen is a binary star system. Let's see, what else? I
finished the personnel review that we were working on. You can check it
out when you wake up. I miss you. Please don't stay away too long. 
CRUSHER: Will? Will, I promise I'll let you know the minute that she
regains consciousness. 
RIKER: I know. 
CRUSHER: There's nothing you can do here. You'll wear yourself out. 
RIKER: Right.
CRUSHER: It's late. Go to bed. That's an order.

DAVIS: Keller is still in there! 
RIKER: Let's move it! Out, out, out! Let's go! Everybody move!
Everybody move! Out! Out! Come on, keep moving! 
LAFORGE: Commander, I need to bring that door down! 
COMPUTER: Antimatter injection breach. Evacuate immediately. 
RIKER: Keller, can you get to a Jeffries tube? Ensign Keller, answer
me! 
DAVIS: You killed her. Keller is still in there! 
LAFORGE: Commander, radiation levels are critical. We've got to seal it
off. 
DAVIS: She was right behind me! 
RIKER: Bring down the door!
