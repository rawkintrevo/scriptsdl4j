TROI LAFORGE TASHA PICARD RIKER COMPUTER MANDL DATA

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Entering standard orbit now. 
PICARD: It takes very special people to live in such desolation. 
TROI: Visionaries who don't see this planet as it is, but as it will
be. 
RIKER: I've always wanted to see terraforming in operation. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, hailing frequencies. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Velara Three base, this is Captain Picard of the starship
Enterprise. (silence)
TASHA: No malfunctioning equipment on either side, sir. They are
receiving us. 
PICARD: Velara Three base, this is the Enterprise. Come in please.
Over. 
LAFORGE: Maybe no one's home. 
DATA: We are sensing life-forms, sir. 
PICARD: Velara Three base, do you copy? 
(A middle-aged man with a slight East European accent. Everyone say Hi!
to General Gogol from the James Bond films) 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: Velara base to Enterprise. Yes, Captain, I'm
Director Mandl. I'm sorry about the delay, but we weren't expecting
visitors. 
PICARD: Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were getting
along. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: We were a little behind, but we're back on
schedule. I'd like to hope we'd be allowed to maintain that schedule. 
TROI: We alarm him for some reason. 
PICARD: Your staff is all well, I presume, Director? 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: Understandably tired. We're working very hard,
Captain. 
PICARD: If there anything we can do to help? You and your staff are
welcome aboard for a change of scene, rest. 
RIKER: We have some holodecks which you might enjoy. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: No disrespect, sir, but we cannot afford the
time. 
COMPUTER: Channel closed. 
TROI: His fear is escalating. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: If you will excuse me, sir, I really must get
back to work. 
TROI: I sense deliberate concealment, sir. 
PICARD: Of what? 
TROI: I don't know, but it's intense. 
PICARD: (channel open) Director Mandl, we've heard of your remarkable
achievements in terraforming. My crew would very much appreciate
looking around. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: This is not really the best time. We are at a
very critical phase just now. 
PICARD: We would require no special attention. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: I'm trying not to be rude, sir, but this is
really very inconvenient. 
(channel closed) 
TROI: He is concealing something. It's more than just being too busy.
Your announcement about coming down has sent him almost to a point of
panic. 
PICARD: Well, whether he wants us or not. (channel open) Director
Mandl, unless you're absolutely refusing permission for us to land at
your station, prepare to receive our away team. 
MANDL [on viewscreen]: As you wish. 
PICARD: Counsellor, perhaps you'd better go along as well. 
TROI: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Someone that tense could be very unpredictable. Stay on your
toes, Number One.
