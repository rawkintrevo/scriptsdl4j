with wine) 
WORF: lujpu' jiH'e, Alexandrijn. 
(he prepares to plunge the dagger into his throat when Troi runs in) 
TROI: Worf, no! 
WORF: You will not stop me. 
TROI: Security to Lieutenant Worf's quarters, immediately. 
WORF: No one can stop me. 
TROI: Why? What is it? 
WORF: I am no longer a warrior. I am no longer strong. I feel. 
TROI: What? What do you feel? 
WORF: I feel fear. 
TROI: To admit that you're afraid gives you strength. 
WORF: Something is waiting for us. I am not strong enough to fight it. 
TROI: No, Worf. It's just an illusion. It's not real. Please, put down
the knife.

TROI: It's all right. Everything's fine, thank you. 
(Security leave) 
TROI: Let me take you to Sickbay.

Acting Captain's log, stardate 44642.1. I have
assumed command of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Our
situation is deteriorating. Many of the crew are unable to function and
our life support systems are beginning to falter.

TROI [OC]: Once before you said double. What did
you mean? What is double? 
HAGAN [OC]: Mates, too bright. Twin. Cannot leave the twin. One moon
circling. 
TROI [OC]: What do you mean? you can't leave? 
HAGAN [OC]: No, no, please. Can't. 
TROI [OC]: You want to leave. Why can't you? 
HAGAN [OC]: Can't go. Help. One moon circling. Eyes, that's it. Eyes in
the dark. 
TROI: Eyes in the dark. That's what the voice said in my dream. Is that
where you heard it? In a dream? Over and over? Beverly, I know what it
is. I know what's happening. 
CRUSHER: What? 
TROI: My nightmare. It's not a dream. It's not a dream at all. It's a
message.
