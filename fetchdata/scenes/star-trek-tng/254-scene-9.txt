[Freighter]

PICARD: The power cell is ready. We should take it
over to the shuttle. 
GUEST3: No. We can't leave right now. 
PICARD: Why not? 
GUEST3: The plasma storms are too strong. It's dangerous. Wait a few
hours, then we can go. 
PICARD: We don't have a few hours. I told you, this cell is already
beginning to degenerate. 
GUEST3: Jean-Luc, it's a difficult journey. The restriction field will
make it very hard for you to walk. 
PICARD: I'm feeling very much better. in fact, I don't intend to go on
using this any longer. 
GUEST3: No! You can't remove it yet. No! 
(Picard pulls the device off his side) 
PICARD: There's no pain. It would appear I don't have any broken ribs
after all. 
GUEST3: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: What's going on? Why are you trying to keep me here? 
GUEST3: Please, I love you. 
PICARD: Why are you keeping me locked in this freighter? You say that
there are wild animals out there but I haven't heard or seen a single
one of them. 
GUEST3: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: What about that comm. panel? You said you damaged it when you
were cutting it out of the shuttle. Did you? You see, I find it hard to
believe that you would destroy the one piece of equipment that could
get you out of here after seven years. And what was this really for? To
keep me immobilised? 
GUEST3: I was afraid. I didn't want you to leave me. 
PICARD: So it was necessary to keep me captive? 
GUEST3: I was scared. I wanted you to stay, to love me. 
PICARD: I'm going to go look for the shuttle myself. 
GUEST3: No. 
(she kisses him) 
PICARD: Anna! 
GUEST3: Don't fight me. 
PICARD: Anna, no! 
(she throws him onto the floor and straddles him) 
GUEST3: You should love me now. We're together. We depend on each other.
I know more about you. Love me. 
PICARD: Anna, stop! 
GUEST3: I've failed. You don't love me. It's over. 
PICARD: Anna. (picks up the pendant) Anna! Anna, where are you going? 
(Anna leaves, locking the door. Picard finds a crowbar and tries to
force it when) 
VOICE [OC]: Hello! Is anyone in there? 
PICARD: Yes! Inside here! 
VOICE [OC]: Hello! 
PICARD: Inside the freighter! The door is on the opposite side! (bangs
on the door) Over here! The door's over here! 
(the door opens and Voval enters without his decoration) 
PICARD: Voval! I thought you were dead. 
GUEST2: Dead? 
PICARD: Yes. There's a woman living here. She told me that she'd been
to the shuttle. She said that she saw you dead. 
GUEST2: Yes. That is understandable. When my species is injured, our
metabolic rate slows until our body can heal itself. This state could
easily be mistaken for death. 
PICARD: I see. 
GUEST2: When you did not return to the shuttle I intended to track you.
Surface conditions made it very difficult. So cold. I saw someone
running away from here. Was it the woman? 
PICARD: Yes. 
GUEST2: Why did she leave the shelter? 
PICARD: She was upset. 
GUEST2: Do you think she may harm herself? There's a dangerous precipice
near here. She was headed in that direction 
PICARD: It's possible. 
GUEST2: Then we should go find her. 
PICARD: You stay here. Keep warm. I'll go and look for her. 
GUEST2: We will go together.
