CONOR: Captain Picard has decided to grant
transport to any individuals who wish to leave Genome Colony. I'm
asking you to stay. 
HANNAH: Aaron, don't you see we can't be happy here any longer? We were
innocent. it will never be that way again. 
CONOR: The experiences of the past week will become part of our
heritage. We will adjust. In a few generations, we will be able to 
HANNAH: We're not willing to stay here a few generations. 
CONOR: Give me six months. Just wait six months before you leave. 
HANNAH: What will that accomplish? 
PICARD: It's true that our presence here has had an unintended
influence on your society. But it's done and there
is no way to undo it. But feelings are running very high. Perhaps it's
not such a bad idea that you should take adequate time to weigh
carefully the consequences of what you're about to do. We are prepared
to return in six months. 
HANNAH: In other words, we are being asked to stay here for six months
while they pressure us to change our minds. 
PICARD: In five days, you have seen only the most superficial evidence
of what life is like outside this biosphere. 
HANNAH: Would you ever choose to live aboard a ship in a bottle,
Captain? You are in command of a starship. You live to explore the
unknown. We ask for that same privilege. 
CONOR: Hannah, this is your home. We are all, in a sense, your family.
Don't we deserve an opportunity to open a dialogue on this issue at the
very least? I am only asking for six months. 
HANNAH: It won't make any difference. You'll only be putting the people
of this colony through unnecessary pain and anguish. 
MARTIN: You are the ones who are causing pain and anguish in this
colony. You. 
HANNAH: Don't you see, Aaron? It's over. It's time for you to lead our
people into a new era. You could come with us. 
CONOR: When you're ready to come home, you will be welcome. 
(Later) 
TROI: What will you do now? 
CONOR: Attempt to assess the damage. Spend the rest of my life on the
near impossible task of rebuilding this society without the proper
pieces. 
TROI: Aaron, you acted in the best interests of your people. There was
no way to avoid what happened. 
CONOR: I replay each step of this in my mind, looking for the wrong
turn, the mistake in judgement. I can find only one. And as hard as I
try, I cannot regret even that one. In fact, I'm quite certain that,
given the opportunity, I would choose to
make the same mistake again. I can only wonder why, with all the
hundreds of genetically compatible women, I would fall in love with
you. 
TROI: Don't say that. 
CONOR: Perhaps it's your imperfections which make you so unique. But I
am in love with you, Deanna Troi, and I will always be.
