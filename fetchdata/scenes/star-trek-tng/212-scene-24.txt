LAFORGE: Computer, locate the electropathic pattern
described in medical database four delta one. 
COMPUTER: Electropathic pattern located. 
LAFORGE: Okay, we're going to track down any possible cause of that
brain pattern. First, what are the medical conditions that might
account for it? 
COMPUTER: Iresine syndrome is a cause of the electropathic pattern. 
LAFORGE: Right. And Doctor Crusher already eliminated that, so how many
non-medical forces or substances might cause the pattern? 
COMPUTER: There are twenty two non-medical agents. 
LAFORGE: Okay. And how many of those are present on the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: None are present on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Are the ship's sensors calibrated to detect all those agents? 
COMPUTER: All agents are scanned by the sensors. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Let's start with the chemical substances. Name them. 
COMPUTER: Ferrazene, hylanatine, dardilion, chrysimite, and manzene. 
LAFORGE: Ferrazene has a complex molecular structure. It breaks down
into bilenium and tarrisite. Do the sensors scan for those? 
COMPUTER: Ship's sensors scan for both compounds. 
LAFORGE: And are they present on the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: Bilenium and tarrisite are not present. 
LAFORGE: Do any of the substances break down into by-products that are
not scanned for? 
COMPUTER: Dardilion contains the byproduct nilizene. Sensors do not
routinely scan for that substance. 
LAFORGE: Well, this isn't a routine situation. Scan for the nilizene. 
COMPUTER: There is no nilizene on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: How did I know you were going to say that? Okay. Let's move on
to the non-chemical agents.

[Crusher's office]

MARTIN: Anything more I can do for you? 
CRUSHER: No, thanks. I was just doing some reading on the Iresine
syndrome. If a new strain has developed, that might explain the normal
histamine count. 
MARTIN: Any luck? 
CRUSHER: Not so far. 
MARTIN: Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. 
(after Martin leaves, Beverly gets a vision of a younger Picard with
some hair) 
PICARD [OC]: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
(They are visiting a morgue) 
PICARD: You don't have to do this. 
CRUSHER: It's important to me. I have to see him. To see him. To see
him. To see him. 
(on their way to the morgue) 
CRUSHER: It's good of you to come. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do. 
(they enter the morgue) 
PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
CRUSHER: I have to face the fact that he's gone. 
PICARD: You shouldn't remember him like this 
CRUSHER: It's good of you to come with me. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do. 
JEV: You shouldn't remember him like this. 
PICARD: It's the least I can do 
(Picard lifts the sheet to reveal dead Jack Crusher, who then opens his
eyes and becomes Jev. Picard is now Jev. Beverly screams)

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: I've spent two hours having a cozy chat
with the computer. I've checked everything I can think of. Any possible
agent that might cause that electropathic pattern. 
DATA: I assume from your tone of voice that you were unsuccessful. 
LAFORGE: Didn't find a thing. 
[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: Doctor Crusher's not going to be too happy
with 
(they see her slumped over her desk and run in)

DATA: Emergency medical team to Doctor Crusher's
office immediately.
