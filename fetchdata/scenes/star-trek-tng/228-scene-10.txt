OBRIEN LAFORGE PICARD HAYES DATA BARCLAY

[Ready room]

HAYES [on monitor]: The Ferengi are claiming two of
their freighters were destroyed by a Cardassian warship in your sector.

PICARD: Is there any evidence to support this? 
HAYES [on monitor]: Although I'm loathe to believe the Ferengi about
anything, there was evidence of Cardassian weapons. If the Cardassians
also attacked the Yosemite, it could indicate a large scale movement
into this sector. 
PICARD: I have an away team on board the ship. The initial report
indicates there was an explosion on board, but we're not sure if it was
from an attack. 
HAYES [on monitor]: How soon until you know? 
PICARD: A few hours. If it looks like Cardassians, I'll contact you
immediately. 
HAYES [on monitor]: Very well. 
(transmission ends) 
DATA [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Data. 
DATA [OC]: The away team is returning to the Enterprise, sir. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. Have Commander Riker come to my Ready room as
soon as he's on board. 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

(Riker leaves) 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Transporter room three. I'm ready to go. 
O'BRIEN: Stand by, Commander.

[USS Yosemite]

(Geordi is beamed away) 
BARCLAY: Barclay to Enterprise. One to beam back. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by, sir. 
(We join Reg in the transporter experience, including a maggot thing
that bites his arm)
