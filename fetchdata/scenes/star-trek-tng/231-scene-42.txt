PICARD DATA LAFORGE

(The alien removes Riker's head restraint)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: Captain, the containment field is beginning
to fluctuate. Failure anticipated in 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: Three minutes, eleven seconds. 
PICARD: We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. 
LAFORGE: Initiating pulse now.

[Alien lab]

(a bright hole appears in the wall. The alien
rushes to confer with a colleague)

[Cargo bay]

DATA: Data to Engineering. The graviton pulse is
having an effect. Tetryon emissions have decreased by nineteen percent.

(the light gets brighter) 
DATA: Captain, additional subharmonics have appeared. They are
reinforcing the tetryon emissions. They appear to be counter-acting the
graviton pulse. 
[Engineering]

DATA [OC]: The rupture is beginning to expand
again, sir. 
LAFORGE: Looks like somebody is fighting back. 
PICARD: Can you strengthen the graviton pulse? 
LAFORGE: I can try to set up a random frequency shift. If we can keep
them from guessing our pulse modulation, they might not be able to
compensate.

[Alien lab]

(Riker is sitting up and being ignored by the
aliens) 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: Tetryon emissions continue to increase. The
rupture is still expanding.
