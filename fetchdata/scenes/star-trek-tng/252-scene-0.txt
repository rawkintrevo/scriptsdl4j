RIKER NEWTON DATA HAWKING EINSTEIN

  [Data's
quarters]

(It's poker night, but we must be on the holodeck
given who Data is playing with. And that really is
Stephen Hawking with the big grin on his face) 
HAWKING: But then I said, in that frame of reference, the perihelion of
Mercury would have precessed in the opposite direction. 
EINSTEIN: (laughing) That is a great story! 
DATA: Quite amusing, Doctor Hawking. You see, Sir Isaac, the joke
depends on an understanding of the relativistic curvature of
space-time. If two non-inertial reference frames are in relative motion

NEWTON: Do not patronise me, sir. I invented physics. The day that
apple fell on my head was the most momentous day in the history of
science. 
HAWKING: Not the apple story again. 
DATA: That story is generally considered to be apocryphal. 
NEWTON: What? How dare you! 
EINSTEIN: Perhaps we should return to the game. Let's see, where were
we? Yes, you raised Mister Data four, which means that the bet is, er,
seven to me? 
NEWTON: The bet is ten! Can't you do simple arithmetic? I don't even
know why I'm here in the first place. What is the point of playing this
ridiculous game? 
DATA: When I play poker with my shipmates, it often appears to be a
useful forum for exploring the different facets of humanity. I was
curious to see how three of history's greatest minds would interact in
this setting. So far, it has proved most illuminating. 
EINSTEIN: And profitable. 
NEWTON: Can we get this over with, please? It's your bet. 
HAWKING: I raise fifty. 
NEWTON: Blast! I fold. 
DATA: I fold as well. 
EINSTEIN: The uncertainty principle will not help you now, Stephen. All
the quantum fluctuations in the universe will not change the cards in
your hand. I call. You are bluffing and you will lose. 
HAWKING: Wrong again, Albert. 
(Hawking has four sevens and a king) 
EINSTEIN: Well. 
RIKER [OC]: Red alert. All personnel report to duty stations. 
DATA: We will have to continue this another time. End programme.
