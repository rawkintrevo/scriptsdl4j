[Transporter room]

CASTILLO: One to beam to the Enterprise-C. We keep
saying goodbye, don't we? 
TASHA: I wish there was more time. 
CASTILLO: More time. I think we have all the time we can handle as it
is. 
(They have a passionate kiss) 
CASTILLO: Lieutenant.

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: Can I get you something, Tasha? 
TASHA: Guinan, I have to know something. What happens to me in the
other time line? 
GUINAN: I don't have alternate biographies of the crew. As I said to
the captain, it's just a feeling. 
TASHA: But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there? I
can see it in your eyes, Guinan. We've known each other too long. 
GUINAN: We weren't meant to know each other at all. At least, that's
what I sense when I look at you. Tasha, you're not supposed to be here.

TASHA: Where am I supposed to be? 
GUINAN: Dead. 
TASHA: Do you know how? 
GUINAN: No. But I do know it was an empty death. A death without
purpose.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. Yes, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Captain, I request a transfer to the Enterprise-C. 
PICARD: For what reason? 
TASHA: They need someone at Tactical. 
PICARD: We need you here. 
TASHA: I'm not supposed to be here, sir. 
PICARD: Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? 
TASHA: I don't belong here, sir. I'm supposed to be dead. 
PICARD: She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? 
TASHA: I felt it was necessary. 
PICARD: I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-C
will fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,
hopefully, will continue for a long while. 
TASHA: I know how important it is that they don't fail, Captain. That's
why I'm requesting this transfer. 
PICARD: You don't belong on that ship, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: No, Captain Garrett belongs on that ship. But she's dead. And I
think there's a certain logic in this request. 
PICARD: There's no logic in this at all. Whether they succeed or not,
the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. 
TASHA: But Captain, at least with someone at Tactical, they will have a
chance to defend themselves well. It may be a matter of seconds or
minutes, but those could be the minutes that change history. Guinan
says I died a senseless death in the other time line. I didn't like the
sound of that, Captain. I've always known the risks that come with a
Starfleet uniform. If I'm to die in one, I'd like my death to count for
something. 
PICARD: Lieutenant. Permission granted. 
TASHA: Thank you, sir.

[1701C Bridge]

CASTILLO: I'm showing phaser banks up to seventy
percent efficiency. We've got an hour left. Let's see if we can get
them up to ninety. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
CASTILLO: Parker, you've got Ops. Fredericks, take the conn. 
TASHA: I'll handle Tactical. Lieutenant Tasha Yar reporting for duty,
sir. 
CASTILLO: You're not part of my crew. 
TASHA: I am now. Captain Picard approved my request for transfer. 
CASTILLO: This isn't a joke, Tasha. We're going back in the rift, into
battle. We're not coming back. 
TASHA: I know the mission. These are my orders, Lieutenant. 
CASTILLO: But I don't want you here. 
TASHA: You need me here. Show me someone on your crew who can do the
job better than I can. 
CASTILLO: Welcome aboard. Take your station, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.

Military log, supplemental. Lieutenant Tasha Yar
has transferred to the Enterprise-C, where she has taken over tactical
duties. Meanwhile, our long range scanners have picked up Klingon
battle cruisers on an intercept course. 
[1701D Bridge]

RIKER: Number and type of ships, Mister Crusher? 
WESLEY: Three K'vort class battlecruisers, sir. 
PICARD: They're not even troubling to cloak themselves.
RIKER: They shouldn't be so confident after the pasting we gave them on
Archer Four. 
PICARD: Attention all hands. As you know, we could outrun the Klingon
vessels, but we must protect the Enterprise-C until she enters the
temporal rift. And we must succeed. Let's make sure history never
forgets the name Enterprise. Picard out. 
(The Klingons fire their disruptors) 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Shields are holding, sir. 
PICARD: Hold fire. Mister Crusher, come about to course one four eight
zero zero three. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Photon torpedoes ready. 
PICARD: Dispersal pattern, sierra. And fire! 
DATA: One enemy target hit, sir. Moderate damage to their forward
shields. Our shields are still holding. Minor damage to secondary hull.

PICARD: Course one four eight. Correction, course one seven zero mark
zero one four. 
WESLEY: Sir, one of the ships is breaking off and going towards the
Enterprise-C. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, keep us within two hundred kilometres of the
Enterprise-C. 
WESLEY: Coming to two one seven mark one one five. Increasing to two
thirds impulse. 
(Enterprise D exchanges fire with the Klingons) 
RIKER: Damage control teams, deck fourteen.
