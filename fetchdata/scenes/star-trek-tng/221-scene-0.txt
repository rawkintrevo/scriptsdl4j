PICARD BRIAM RIKER

[Ready room]

PICARD: I apologise for the delay in our arrival,
Ambassador Briam. We had to stop at Harod Four to pick up a group of
stranded miners. 
BRIAM: Please, Captain, we are grateful that the Federation has taken
as much interest as it has in this matter. 
PICARD: Was Commander La Forge able to provide you with the special
cargo handling provisions you requested? 
BRIAM: Indeed he was. However, until we reach the rendezvous with the
Valtese, may I ask that the cargo bay be declared off-limits to all but
the most essential personnel? 
PICARD: I trust, Ambassador, that this cargo is in no way dangerous? 
BRIAM: Oh, no, nothing of the sort. I'm cautious because it's quite
fragile, and quite irreplaceable. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we've just picked up a distress call from a
Ferengi shuttle. 
PICARD: Set a course to intercept. 
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir. 
BRIAM: Captain, the timing of our ceremony with Alrik is critical. It
cannot be delayed. 
PICARD: We'll be at the rendezvous on schedule, don't worry. Excuse me.
