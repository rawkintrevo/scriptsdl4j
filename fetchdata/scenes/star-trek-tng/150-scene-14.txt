[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, we're heading straight into the path
of that stellar matter. 
PICARD: Shields up. 
WORF: Negative. The shields will not respond. 
DATA: Thirty seconds to impact, sir. 
PICARD: Manual override on shields. 
WORF: Shields are rising. 
RIKER: Reset dampeners.

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Dampeners not responding. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Unable to reset. 
PICARD: Reverse impulse engines. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Initiating reverse sequence, now.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Our momentum is still carrying us into the
path of the stellar matter. 
DATA: Twelve seconds to impact, sir. 
RIKER: Prepare for impact. Medical personnel, report to the Bridge.
Commander Data, check all systems. 
DATA: All systems functioning normally, sir. 
PICARD: Computer, explain control malfunction. 
COMPUTER: No control malfunction has been recorded.

[Sickbay]

(It's busy. They've even got Guy sitting on a bed.
Doctor Stubbs is lying prone, being treated) 
NURSE: Lay down carefully. There you go. 
WESLEY: Doctor Stubbs, the captain asked me to tell you that our
systems are back to normal, and we can try another launch attempt as
soon as you're ready. 
STUBBS: Quite a dynamic family team, you Crushers. 
CRUSHER: Well, it's nice to be together again. I was at Starfleet
Medical for a year. I missed about two inches of him. 
STUBBS: I'm not sure I'd want my mother to be flying through space with
me. No, I take that back. I am sure. I wouldn't want her. My mother is
a formidable woman, too. A woman of letters. A great critic. 
WESLEY: I know. 
STUBBS: Good Lord, son. You didn't read that unauthorised biography? Is
this all this boy does, Doctor? Fly the ship and read? Doesn't he ever
have any fun? 
CRUSHER: Sure he does. 
WESLEY: Actually, most of my free time is taken up with my studies. I'm
trying to get into Starfleet Academy, and I earn credits for the time
spent on the Enterprise, but it's just not the same. 
NURSE: Are you ready to sit up? 
STUBBS: Well. I am whole again. Thank you, Doctor. Come along, Wesley.
Let's go see if Humpty Dumpty is still in one piece. 
(Stubbs and Wesley leave, and Beverly goes to investigate the sound of
running liquid. A food dispenser is overflowing a glass) 
CRUSHER: Computer, fix the food slot. 
COMPUTER: The food slot is functioning properly. 
CRUSHER: Well, check again. 
COMPUTER: The food slot is functioning properly. 
CRUSHER: Computer, deactivate food slot.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're analysing the engineering systems
data, Captain. So far we're showing nothing unusual 
[Ready room]

LAFORGE [OC]: In the computer log for that time
period. 
PICARD: Run a level one diagnostic series. Come. I want a computer
that's one hundred percent to expedite Doctor Stubbs' experiment. As
well as the food slots in Sickbay. Picard out. 
CRUSHER: Which seem to be working again, for the moment anyway. 
PICARD: What can I do for you, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, how would you feel if you were a seventeen year old
and the only Starfleet Officer whose mother was on board? 
PICARD: Inhibited, I suppose. But then, I'm not Wesley. And if you are
concerned about him, I see no evidence that there is a problem. 
CRUSHER: I know, but, in a funny kind of way, that's exactly my point.
We talk. We smile. It's almost too polite. 
PICARD: Beverly, isn't it just a matter of time? I know how difficult
it was for you being away. 
CRUSHER: Tell me about him. 
PICARD: Well, he's becoming a very fine officer. He works as hard as
any member of the crew. Riker says his studies are on line. 
CRUSHER: No. Tell me about him. 
PICARD: He's his father's son. Honest, trusting, strong. 
CRUSHER: Does he have many friends? Has he ever been in love? Jean-Luc,
I'm worried. He's come so far, so fast, And since I've been back, I
don't feel 
PICARD: His dependence. Beverly, look, he's seventeen years old. 
CRUSHER: What were you doing when you were seventeen? 
PICARD: Probably getting into more trouble than Wesley, I can assure
you. 
CRUSHER: So was I. Isn't that what seventeen's supposed to be?
