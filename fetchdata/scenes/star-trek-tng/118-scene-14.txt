RIKER PICARD TASHA CUSTODIAN RADUE WESLEY DUANA HARRY RASHELLA CRUSHER DATA

[Custodian room]

(There are hexagonal screens on the walls, a single
console, and some chairs around the edge of the room) 
DUANA: Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice will be entered into the
authorised file for Third Level clearance. 
CUSTODIAN: Proceed, Duana. 
DUANA: Announce yourself to the Custodian. 
WESLEY: Hello, Custodian. I am Wesley Crusher. 
CUSTODIAN: Hello, Wesley. Your voice will now activate Third Level
clearance. 
WESLEY: What does that mean? 
CUSTODIAN: You may ask any questions you wish. 
WESLEY: Thank you. Duana, what does the Custodian do? 
DUANA: It frees us from all burden. It takes care of all our needs. It
regulates our lives. 
WESLEY: Who built it? 
DUANA: The Progenitors. 
WESLEY: When? 
DUANA: Oh, hundreds of centuries ago. 
WESLEY: What is its power source? 
DUANA: Wesley, why is that important? It does what we ask it. It always
has. What difference does it make how it works? 
WESLEY: If you don't know how it works, then how can you repair it? 
DUANA: Why would we want to repair it? 
WESLEY: From time to time, every computer, I mean Custodian, requires
maintenance. 
DUANA: Wesley, Radue is right. You ask questions I can't answer. Ask
the Custodian instead. 
WESLEY: Custodian, can you show me where Harry is? 
CUSTODIAN: Yes. 
WESLEY: Custodian, show me Harry. 
(on the little screen, Harry is having his first go with the sculpting
laser on a block of wood. Sawdust flies everywhere) 
HARRY [on screen]: I never did this before. It's fun. 
WESLEY: You are going to make him into a sculptor? 
DUANA: He already is. He was just never encouraged properly. The tool
Leda is giving him will allow him to bring out his visions. 
WESLEY: It will take him years to learn to do that. 
DUANA: Oh, no. It will happen quite quickly. 
WESLEY: Custodian, show me Alexandra. 
(She and Rashella are playing with a 3d hologram controlled by a
joystick) 
WESLEY: Custodian, show me Mason. 
DUANA: Stop, Custodian. We must work now. There is much to learn. 
(Wesley looks at the door with the symbol on it) 
WESLEY: What's in there? The power source? 
DUANA: I don't know. It's forbidden. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit
around Aldea. It's becoming all too evident that talk will not effect
the return of our children. We must neutralise the Aldean shield. Until
then, we are helpless. 
[Bridge]

TASHA: Sir, Radue is hailing us. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard? 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are ready, Radue. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Are you ill, Captain? 
PICARD: No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff Officer, Radue. Starfleet
Regulation six point five seven requires that at least two Staff
Officers are present during any treaty or contract negotiations. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Very well. 
RIKER: Not much on pleasantries, is he? 
DATA: I am not aware of Regulation six point five seven. 
PICARD: No, Data. Neither am I. 
DATA: I see, sir. Oh, I see, sir. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher, please report to the Bridge. Now, we'll see
what they have in mind. 
[First Unit]

PICARD: Before we begin, we want to see the
children. 
RADUE: No. We're here to negotiate appropriate compensation, not to
pander to emotions. Please sit. 
PICARD: We do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve your
conscience by offering goods in exchange for our children. 
RADUE: Why do you want them back so badly? You can always have more. 
PICARD: You are trifling with the primal instincts of our species. I
must warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for their
children. 
RADUE: Returning the children is non-negotiable. 
RASHELLA: I promise you, they'll have a beautiful life with us. And
they'll be father and mother to a new breed born of an ancient culture.

CRUSHER: But how can you be so sure that they can have children? You
can't. 
RADUE: But they will. Our inability to bear children is a genetic
dysfunction. It's not contagious. 
PICARD: We sympathise with your situation. Surely there is a solution
which can be mutually satisfactory? 
RADUE: For us, the problem is solved. And we're offering you
information on areas of the galaxy you do not even know exist. What
more can we offer? What more would you like? 
PICARD: A significant beginning. But first, I must ask that Doctor
Crusher be allowed to see her son before we continue. 
RADUE: You are a stubborn people. Ah, well, that too can be a positive
trait. You may see him.
