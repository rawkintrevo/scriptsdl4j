summoned leaves culprits sensed want cruisers existence odin agree

[Guest quarters]

TRENT: You will remain here until summoned. 
(He leaves as Tasha sweeps the room with her tricorder) 
RIKER: Is thus area secure? Can we talk? 
TASHA: Yes. Tricorder doesn't show any listening devices or anything
else of a threatening nature. 
RIKER: Good. Troi? 
TROI: There was much fear in that room.
RIKER: Paranoia, I'd say. But of what? 
TROI: I cannot say. But their fear was not focused. I sensed that all
were not concerned for the same reason. Undoubtedly there are survivors
from the Odin on this planet. 
RIKER: I agree. Otherwise, why would they be so circumspect? 
TASHA: As Mistress Beata is so fond of saying, good question.
DATA: What do we do if they deny the existence of survivors? 
RIKER: Let's not look for problems. 
[Turbolift]

PICARD: I want all departments prepared for a warp
six trip into the Neutral Zone as soon as the away team completes its
mission. 
WORF: Trouble, Captain? 
PICARD: Insurance. Romulan battle cruisers have been detected near one
of our border posts. 
[Corridor]

(Picard steps out of the turbolift into a snowball)

PICARD: They've requested assistance as soon as Argh! 
(The culprits leave the holodeck) 
PICARD: Report, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: We finished our ski lesson, sir, and it kind of just happened. 
PICARD: On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher, nothing just happens. What
is that smell? 
WORF: Hmm, yes. Slightly reminiscent of night blooming throgni,
Captain. From home. Quite stimulating, wouldn't you say? 
PICARD: No. 
WESLEY: I don't smell anything. I'm a little congested. The snow. 
PICARD: Don't let this just happen again, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.
