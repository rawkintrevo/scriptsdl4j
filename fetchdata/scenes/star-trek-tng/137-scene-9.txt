PICARD LAFORGE WESLEY

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
WESLEY: Sir, may I speak with you for a minute? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Well, what is it, Wesley? 
WESLEY: It's about the Iconians, sir. I was told they were just a myth.

PICARD: China was thought to be only a myth until Marco Polo travelled
there. No, the Iconians were certainly real. Sit down. We know that
three systems within this sector had a number of cultural similarities.
Similarities which could only be explained by there being a single
unifying influence. 
WESLEY: So they colonised those worlds? 
PICARD: Probably conquered. 
WESLEY: You mean they were warlike? 
PICARD: Perhaps. Ancient texts did speak of 'Demons of Air and
Darkness'. 
WESLEY: Air and darkness? 
PICARD: Legend has it that they travelled without the benefit of
spaceships, merely appearing out of thin air on distant planets. 
WESLEY: Sounds like magic. 
PICARD: Well, we would appear magical to Stone Age people. 
WESLEY: How did you find all this out? 
PICARD: Archaeology has been a hobby since Academy days. But why don't
we talk about what really brought you here? 
WESLEY: It's the Yamato, Captain. I can't stop thinking about her. All
those people dead. I don't know how you and Commander Riker and Geordi,
how you handle it so easily. 
PICARD: Easily? Oh no, not easily. We handle it because we're trained
to, as you will be. Tea, Earl Grey, hot. But if the time ever comes
when the death of a single individual fails to move us (a pot plant
appears in the replicator) 
WESLEY: Didn't you order tea, sir? 
PICARD: Now that should not have happened.

Captain's log, supplemental. As happened with our
sister ship, the Enterprise is being to experience a series of system
failures. So far they are random, but I fear they could be early
symptoms of what happened to the Yamato.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Engineering. 
LAFORGE: La Forge. 
PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Are you making any progress toward solving
our problems? 
LAFORGE: Solving them, no sir, but I can eliminate one worry. It is not
a design flaw.
