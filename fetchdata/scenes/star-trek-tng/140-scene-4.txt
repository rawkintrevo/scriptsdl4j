[Transporter room]

RIKER: Ensign. 
HERBERT: Ah, you're right on time, Commander. He's on his way now. 
(A fit, silver-haired man is beamed on board) 
RIKER: Dad. You're the civilian advisor? The strategic attach? 
KYLE: I asked Captain Picard to keep it quiet. I didn't want you to
make you nervous or excited. 
RIKER: It's been fifteen years. Excitement is hardly the appropriate
emotion. 
KYLE: You've done well. First Officer on the Enterprise. Quite a
feather in your cap. 
RIKER: I've worked hard. 
KYLE: Of course. I'm proud of you, son. 
RIKER: If you'll excuse me, I've got my duties to attend to. When
you've settled in, we can complete our briefing.
Have Security arrange an escort for this gentleman. 
HERBERT: Aye, sir. 
[Corridor]

WESLEY: Worf, did you hear about Commander Riker's
promotion? 
WORF: Yes. 
WESLEY: He didn't know his father was coming. He was completely
surprised. 
WORF: So? 
WESLEY: Can you imagine if it was your father? 
WORF: I never knew my father. 
WESLEY: And I didn't have a father long enough to know him. 
WORF: It is a waste of time to think of such things. 
WESLEY: I wasn't thinking about it, but everybody needs somebody. 
WORF: Enough!
