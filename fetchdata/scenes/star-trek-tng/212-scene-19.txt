[Bridge]

PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Picard to
Commander Riker, answer please. Computer, locate Commander Riker. 
COMPUTER: Commander Riker is in his quarters. 
WORF: On my way, sir.

[Riker's quarters]

(Worf finds Will slumped across his desk) 
Medical log, stardate 45431.7. Commander Riker is
the second officer who has fallen into an unexplained coma. I have
examined the Ullians and ruled out the possibility that they carry a
harmful organism.

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: I compared Deanna's brain scan to one that
I took during her last physical. There is a difference. This time
there's a trace of electropathic activity. 
PICARD: And Commander Riker? 
CRUSHER: I found the same pattern. If I didn't know better, I'd say
they both had Iresine syndrome. That's the only medical condition that
would produce that pattern. 
WORF: What is Iresine syndrome? 
CRUSHER: A very rare neurological disorder first diagnosed in the
twenty third century. It's characterised by an identical electropathic
residue. 
PICARD: Why discount the possibility that it's responsible for these
comas? 
CRUSHER: Iresine is always accompanied by a severely decreased
histamine count. Both Will and Deanna showed normal levels.
I've asked Commander La Forge to conduct a shipwide diagnostic to
determine any other agent that might cause the same electropathic
pattern. 
WORF: Commander Riker and Counsellor Troi were in perfect health until
the Ullians arrived. It would be wise to quarantine the aliens. 
PICARD: I believe that it would be premature to take that action,
Mister Worf. There's no real evidence linking these comas with the
Ullians. 
CRUSHER: That's true, but there is something curious. The electropathic
residue I discovered is located in the thalamus. That's the area of the
cerebral cortex that involves memory function.

[Ullian's quarters]

TARMIN: I've been accused of putting people to
sleep with one too many stories, Captain, but this is the first time
it's ever been suggested that I might be the cause of someone's coma. 
PICARD: I mean no disrespect, but we are faced with an alarming
situation 
INAD: Why do you suspect us, Captain? 
PICARD: Suspect is perhaps too strong a word. I'm simply trying to
determine what has caused two of my officers to fall into comas. 
JEV: But you've already examined us. We aren't carrying anything
harmful. 
CRUSHER: In further study of the victims, I detected some abnormal
patterns in the area of the brain that involves memory. 
PICARD: In light of your telepathic abilities, it raises the question. 
INAD: Captain, it is not our wish to obstruct you. What would you like?

CRUSHER: If I could do further examinations tomorrow. Perhaps monitor
you during a memory probe. 
TARMIN: Scrutiny does not frighten us. 
JEV: We will be happy to cooperate, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. I'll contact you in the morning.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: You're the only person on board to undergo
a memory probe by the Ullians. I'd like to do a neurological work up
and see if I can detect any residual effect. Doctor Martin will monitor
your vital signs while I conduct the scan. 
KEIKO: I'm happy to help. 
CRUSHER: Have you had any unusual symptoms since the probe? Headaches?
Dizziness? 
KEIKO: No, nothing like that. It was a wonderful experience. 
CRUSHER: Electrical activity is normal. CPK levels are normal.
Hippocampus is stable, and the thalamus? The thalamus is normal. There
is no indication at all of the electropathic residual. 
KEIKO: Is that good? 
CRUSHER: Oh, you're fine, Keiko. But I am no closer to solving this
mystery.
