TROI ARMUS LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Shuttlecraft]

(Armus has slithered over the shuttlecraft, and
Troi has found her communicator doesn't work) 
ARMUS [OC]: Your friends have deserted you. They're not coming back. 
TROI: You're wrong. 
ARMUS [OC]: I killed one of them. 
TROI: Yes. I know. 
ARMUS [OC]: How could you be in there and know that? 
TROI: I felt her die. 
ARMUS [OC]: Do you want to know why I killed her? 
TROI: Your answer would be meaningless. That act had no reason. 
ARMUS [OC]: Exactly. It had no meaning. I did it because I wanted to.
It amused me. 
TROI: No. You thought it would amuse you, but it didn't. You felt no
satisfaction. 
ARMUS [OC]: No. It was too easy. 
TROI: You wanted her to suffer. You have a great need. 
ARMUS [OC]: I need nothing. 
TROI: Liar. End this. Let us go. 
ARMUS [OC]: Not yet. 
TROI: They won't give you what you want. 
ARMUS [OC]: And what is that? 
TROI: To break their spirit. 
ARMUS [OC]: Oh, is that what I want? If breaking their spirit will
amuse me, then that's what I will have. 
TROI: Never.

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: She didn't do anything. Her phaser was
lowered. 
DATA: She only wanted to get to Troi and Lieutenant Prieto. 
RIKER: There was nothing provocative about what she did. 
CRUSHER: She was killed in a brutal, senseless act. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar's death is very painful for all of us. We will
have to deal with it as best we can for now. Until the shuttle crew is
safely beamed aboard this ship, our feelings will have to wait. Is that
understood? Lieutenant Worf, you are now Acting Chief of Security. 
WORF: I will do my best, sir. 
PICARD: Doctor, what is the state of the shuttle crew? 
CRUSHER: We're still receiving faint life signs, but the sensor
readings are fluctuating. They may not be accurate. 
DATA: Armus is capable of creating undefined forcefields. In effect, we
are powerless to communicate or use the transporter unless it allows
it. 
PICARD: A creature against whom we seem to have no defence. Number One?

RIKER: It's down on that planet waiting for us to come back. It killed
Tasha and it could have killed us, but it didn't. Deanna and Ben are
alive for a reason, and it knows we're not going anywhere as long as
they're still alive. 
PICARD: Are you saying it's attack on Yar was not arbitrary but part of
some tactic? 
RIKER: The only way to find out is to go back down. 
LAFORGE: Commander, I may be able to see something in the creature
which might be helpful. 
PICARD: Agreed. Prepare your away team, Number One. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf? 
WORF: I will remain on the ship. The object here is not to engage the
creature in battle. The goal is the safe return of Counsellor Troi and
Lieutenant Prieto. I can best accomplish this at the Tactical Station. 
PICARD: Very good. Number One? 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: Enterprise. 
PICARD [OC]: Number One. 
RIKER: We're approaching the shuttlecraft. The creature is covering it.

[Shuttlecraft]

ARMUS [OC]: I lied to you. They came back. 
TROI: Let me talk with them. 
ARMUS [OC]: No. 
TROI: Why? Does the thought of my having contact with them make you
uneasy? 
ARMUS [OC]: No. Not being able to contact you, not knowing if you are
alive, makes them uneasy. Can't you feel how worried they are? 
TROI: Yes. Yes, they are worried. 
ARMUS [OC]: They care for you. You must be very special. 
TROI: We are members of a community. We all care for one another. 
ARMUS [OC]: Equally? 
TROI: You were really surprised they came back. 
ARMUS [OC]: Yes. 
TROI: Why? Because the others did not? 
ARMUS [OC]: What others? 
TROI: You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones who
hurt you. Who left you alone, rejected. The ones who make you so angry.

ARMUS [OC]: What do you know of them? 
TROI: Only what you tell me. 
ARMUS [OC]: I will tell you nothing. 
TROI: Not now. But soon. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, look at this. The force of the
energy field around the shuttlecraft decreased for a few moments when
the creature was draped over it. 
PICARD: But not low enough to beam them out. 
WORF: Almost. 
WESLEY: It's approaching the away team now, and the energy field over
the shuttlecraft is back to full intensity. 
PICARD: Chart it. I want to see if there's a pattern. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Planet surface]

(Armus rises from his slick) 
ARMUS: She said you'd be back. 
RIKER: Then she is alive. 
ARMUS: For now. Why have you returned? 
RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What do
you want? 
ARMUS: Maybe I want nothing. 
RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. 
ARMUS: I still might. 
RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. 
ARMUS: If I tell you, will you give it to me? 
RIKER: I might. It depends. 
CRUSHER: I am a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends. 
ARMUS: Say please. 
CRUSHER: Please. 
ARMUS: You ask nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind.
Talk to her from here. 
CRUSHER: How? Troi, can you hear me?
