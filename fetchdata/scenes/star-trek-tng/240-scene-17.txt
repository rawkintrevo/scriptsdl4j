DATA: Sensors are picking up a polarised magnetic
distortion to our port side. 
PICARD: Analysis. 
DATA: The distortion is extremely weak, sir. It appears to be moving
slowly. It is gone, sir. 
RIKER: Gone? 
DATA: The distortion no longer registers on our instruments. 
PICARD: Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. Our understanding of Romulan technology is still
limited. 
DESEVE: Captain, Romulan ships use a forced quantum singularity as a
power source. If that system is not functioning
perfectly or is damaged even slightly, it might show through the cloak
as a magnetic disturbance of some kind. 
DATA: The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing three three seven
mark ten. It has disappeared again, sir. 
PICARD: Mister DeSeve, in your opinion is it possible that we're
picking up a cloaked Romulan ship? 
DESEVE: It's a strong possibility, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, continue your scan. Ensign, link navigational
control to Mister Data's console and plot a course for that distortion.

PILOT: Commander, the Enterprise is underway. 
TORETH: Good. What is their course? 
PILOT: They're heading for us, sir. 
TORETH: What? 
PILOT: They appear to be on an intercept course. 
TORETH: What is the status of our cloaking device? Is there a
malfunction of any kind? 
PILOT: Cloaking device functioning correctly, sir. All shipboard
emissions within normal range. 
TORETH: Maintain full sensor scans. 
N'VEK: Commander. The Enterprise may simply be engaged in search
operations. 
TORETH: Perhaps.

PICARD: Where is it now, Mister Data? 
DATA: It has disappeared once again, sir. I believe it may have been
coming to a halt. 
PICARD: Stop engines. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: If this is a Romulan ship, will it stay in position until we
leave? 
DESEVE: I don't think so, sir. A Romulan Commander's instinct would be
to attack.
