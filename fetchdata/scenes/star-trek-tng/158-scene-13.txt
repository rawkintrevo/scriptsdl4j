[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Admiral Jarok has provided me with the
locations, strengths and tactical plans of the Romulan fleet.
Mister La Forge, he is prepared to give you data regarding engines,
weapons and the cloaking systems of the warbird class
starship. But I believe his experience as a field commander will be
more valuable for its strategic sense than in the technical areas. 
LAFORGE: Any edge'll help, Captain. 
PICARD: Don't depend on it. For all we know, he may still be lying, but
we shall find that out soon enough. Number One, set course for Nelvana
Three.

Second officer's log, stardate 43465.2. We have
entered the Neutral Zone in direct violation of the Treaty of Algeron.
Presuming Romulan warships are cloaked and monitoring us, we expect
heavy resistance as we approach Nelvana Three.

RIKER: Tactical? 
WORF: Nothing on sensors. 
RIKER: I don't like it I would've expected a greeting party. 
PICARD: You echo another noteworthy commander in a similar
circumstances, Number One. A countryman of yours, George Armstrong
Custer when his Seventh Cavalry arrived at the Little Big Horn. 
RIKER: May we have better luck. 
DATA: Approaching Nelvana system. 
PICARD: Engage impulse engines. 
RIKER: Nelvana Three on screen. Still no sign of them on sensors. In a
way, I'd rather be fighting my way this, It's just too damned easy. 
PICARD: Prepare to enter standard orbit. Data? 
DATA: Scanning the planet, sir. No life forms, no power sources, no
weapons systems. 
RIKER: No indication of a base at all? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: The subspace signal the probe detected? The ionisation
disturbances? 
DATA: I am picking them up, sir, but I cannot identify the source. They
seem to be moving in an orbital path with an eight hundred kilometre
apogee. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, bring the Admiral up here. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Maybe they abandoned the planet after he defected. 
DATA: There is no scarring on the planet surface that would denote
heavy construction of any kind. 
RIKER: A cloaking device of some sort, to hide the entire base? 
DATA: A cloaking device operating on the surface would be given away by
visible distortion effects. 
(Jarok and his escort enter) 
PICARD: Perhaps you'd care to explain why we're here, Admiral. 
RIKER: There doesn't appear to be a base. 
GUEST2: I don't understand. 
PICARD: Nelvana Three, Admiral. No base, no weapons, no sign of any
life at all. 
GUEST2: But I saw the tactical communiqus. The records. Timetables for
completion. An entire legion was assigned to the section. 
PICARD: Is it possible they could have been feeding you disinformation?
You said that you had been censured. Reassigned, four months ago. They
knew of your dissatisfaction. Could all this have been to test your
loyalty? 
GUEST2: No. No. It's impossible. 
PICARD: They let you escape with an arsenal of worthless secrets. What
other explanation is there? 
RIKER: Permission to withdraw from the Neutral Zone? 
PICARD: At your earliest convenience, Number One. 
RIKER: Helm, bring her round one hundred and eighty degrees. Geordi,
get us out of here. 
LAFORGE [OC]: I hear you, Commander. 
WORF: Two Romulan warships uncloaking. Coordinates 
(He's interrupted by impacts to the shields) 
WORF: Shields holding. 
RIKER: Damage? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Minor damage in the secondary hull.
