TROI LAFORGE WESLEY DUFFY DATA BARCLAY

 [Troi's office]

BARCLAY: I just didn't know what to say. 
TROI: What do you wish you had said? 
BARCLAY: I should have told him to mind his own damned business. I knew
about the flux capacitor. I didn't need to hear about it from some
seventeen year old kid. 
TROI: You're letting it get you much too upset. 
BARCLAY: You think so? 
TROI: Why are you so hard on yourself? 
BARCLAY: You don't know. It's hard out there. 
TROI: I understand, but let go of it. You're here now. 
BARCLAY: You're right, of course. 
TROI: Of course. Let me help you relax. 
(She starts massaging his shoulders) 
BARCLAY: I'd like that. 
TROI: I knew you would. 
(They kiss) 
BARCLAY: That's nice, but I'm in the mood for someplace a little more
unusual. Computer. Run Barclay
programme fifteen. 
(And the office transforms into)

[Holodeck - Glade]

(Deanna is in Grecian robes) 
TROI: I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions and
embrace love, truth, joy. 
(Barclay embraces her, passionately) 
[Ten Forward]

WESLEY: But I thought that's the point of the
briefing. To discuss different approaches. 
LAFORGE: It's not that you did anything wrong, Wes. It's just that
Barclay's, well, he's my new project. 
DUFFY: Yeah, Broccoli's a real project all right. 
LAFORGE: I just need to draw him out some more. 
WESLEY: And I shut him down. Poor Broccoli. 
DATA: Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant Barclay being referred to
clandestinely as a vegetable? 
WESLEY: It's a joke, Data. You know, a nickname. 
DATA: Nicknames generally denote fondness, a diminutive shared between
friends. 
LAFORGE: Data's absolutely right. The nickname stops here and now.
Captain's orders. 
(Duffy picks up his glass, which has an impression of his fingers on it
and promptly leaks from the bottom) 
DUFFY: What the hell? 
WESLEY: What happened to your glass? 
(Data's glass is the same)
