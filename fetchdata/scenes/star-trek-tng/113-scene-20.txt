[Outside Holodeck]

RIKER: Have you tried the intercom? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
RIKER: Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! 
(Wesley takes a piece of equipment and uses it to 'look' at the
holodeck controls) 
RIKER: Are you seeing anything? 
WESLEY: No, sir. 
RIKER: What can I do? 
LAFORGE: Not a thing. We have to go through this millimetre by
millimetre. 
RIKER: All right. Get it fixed. 
LAFORGE: Easy, Wes. Slow it down. If there's an anomaly, you could go
right past it, okay? 
[Interrogation room]

MCNARY: Okay, Dix, we're cutting you loose. 
PICARD: That's welcome news. 
BELL: You better not try to leave town. 
PICARD: If I leave town, the town leaves with me. I get the feeling
your friend doesn't like me. 
MCNARY: We know you're dealing with Redblock, Dixon. Take it from a
friend, it doesn't help your case. 
PICARD: Redblock? I'll keep it in mind. Thank you for helping me. 
(Takes a cigarette, inhales and coughs) 
MCNARY: Forget it. Hey, Dix, when are you coming over for supper? The
kids'd love to see you, and you know how much you love Sharon's
cooking. 
PICARD: Soon, my friend. For the moment, I have other duties. 
MCNARY: Blonde or brunette? 
PICARD: She's a lady, all right, and her name is Enterprise. 
MCNARY: Sounds like a working girl to me. I'll stop by the office with
a bottle of scotch. You can tell me all about her.

[Police station]

(McNary sees the look on Picard's face when he sees
Crusher, and leaves without another word) 
CRUSHER: Have a good time? 
PICARD: I don't know. Sometimes it almost seemed too real. I must say,
you wear it well. I'm glad you could make it. 
CRUSHER: Why, thank you, Mister Hill. 
PICARD: Maybe we should be getting back to the Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: We are on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Oh, yes, of course, so we are. 
CRUSHER: Do we have time to see your office? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Why not. 
WHALEN: Captain, mind if I join you? 
DATA: Yeah, me too, boss. I'd love to take a gander. 
(rolled eyes all round)
