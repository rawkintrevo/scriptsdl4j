(Data is at a rear computer station) 
PICARD: Mister Data, there's a reference in Captain Varley's personal
log to a probe that scanned the Yamato. 
DATA: Aye, sir. We have a visual record. 
PICARD: Put it on main viewer. 
RIKER: What the devil is that? 
(A blue globe sends out energy tendrils to the Yamato) 
PICARD: Have you seen anything like that before? 
DATA: No, sir. It appears to be a scanner. Possibly a transmitter. 
RIKER: Transmitting what? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. 
PICARD: Engineering. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: La Forge. 
PICARD [OC]: What progress on the matter-antimatter scan? 
LAFORGE: Everything continues to check out. I'm starting an analysis on
the magnetic coils.

PICARD: When the Yamato was probed, where was she? 
DATA: In orbit around a planet at coordinates two two seven mark three
five nine, sir. 
PICARD: ETA at warp factor eight? 
DATA: Twelve hours sixteen minutes, sir. 
WORF: Sir, that would put us substantially close to the Romulan side of
the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: That can't be helped. Ensign, lay in a course. Warp factor
eight. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: We're going to assume the Yamato's mission. 
RIKER: And risk a war? 
PICARD: Perhaps prevent one.
