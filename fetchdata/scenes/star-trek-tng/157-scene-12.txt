[Bridge]

PICARD: Your people prepare a warm welcome. 
BRULL: That's Chorgan's ship. 
WORF: Shields holding. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Chorgan. Tell him Brull has brought us to
talk. 
WORF: Chorgan is not responding. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, can we knock out their shields without seriously
damaging their ship? 
WORF: I believe we can, sir. 
PICARD: Prepare phasers and open a channel. 
WORF: Phasers locked. Channel open. 
PICARD: Chorgan, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. All
right, let's focus their attention. Mister Worf, fire phasers. 
WORF: Their forward shields are inoperative. 
PICARD: Well done, Lieutenant. 
WORF: We are being hailed, sir. 
PICARD: That's better. On screen. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: Brull, you traitor! You have led them here to
destroy me! 
PICARD: Chorgan, if I had wanted you destroyed, you would not be
talking to me now. Obviously, I wanted something else. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: And what is that? 
PICARD: I have on board Sovereign Marouk of Acamar Three. I want you to
hear what she and Brull have to say. 
BRULL: She's worth listening to. 
CHORGAN [on viewscreen]: I don't wish to listen to either of you. 
PICARD: You have no choice. Prepare to receive us. We're beaming on
board. Picard out. Cancel Red Alert. Tell Sovereign Marouk meet me in
transporter three. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: You're going alone, Captain? 
PICARD: The danger is minimal, Number One. Chorgan is unlikely to do
anything rash with the Enterprise's phasers trained on his ship. 
RIKER: There are still risks. 
PICARD: For these negotiations to succeed I must be a mediator, not an
enforcer. You have the Bridge, Number One. Brull.

[Chorgan's ship]

PICARD: Chorgan, this is Sovereign Marouk. 
CHORGAN: You may sit. 
PICARD: Chorgan, I think you will find Marouk's proposal 
CHORGAN: You know, Picard, I could take you prisoner. Oh, don't worry,
I've no intention of doing so. I know what trouble it's been for you to
get here, and I am curious why. 
PICARD: Then let's proceed. 
MAROUK: Quite simply, I am proposing amnesty for every Gatherer. 
CHORGAN: Amnesty? You mean slavery. 
BRULL: Chorgan, if you want to know what I think 
CHORGAN: I don't. Say what you came to say, though I doubt that I'm
going to believe you. 
MAROUK: I didn't believe this very persuasive Federation Captain when
he suggested that we could reconcile our differences. I'm convinced now
it's the right thing, not just for you, but for us too. We need you
back. I've brought some Acamarian brandy. I'm sure it's been a long
time. 
(Yuta serves the glasses) 
CHORGAN: No! You have spent a century hunting us down. 
PICARD: She is trying to put an end to all that. 
CHORGAN: Yes, by luring us back and putting us in prison. 
MAROUK: No, by accepting you back as free men. 
CHORGAN: Will you feed and clothe us, too? 
MAROUK: No, of course I won't. What I will do is give you the means to
feed and clothe yourselves. We've set aside some land and you can use
it to 
CHORGAN: Land? Do we look like farmers to you? 
MAROUK: Then don't farm. Use the land as you wish. It is yours. And the
moment you set foot on it, you'll be better off than you are today. You
won't be running any longer. 
CHORGAN: We will need autonomy. 
MAROUK: Autonomy? 
PICARD: Sovereign, we can at least acknowledge that Chorgan appears
willing to discuss your offer. 
MAROUK: There are many levels of autonomy. Certainly your region would
have certain rights. 
CHORGAN: Yes, and those rights will be spelled out before I agree to
anything.
