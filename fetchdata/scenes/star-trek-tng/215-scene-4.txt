RIKER WORF PICARD TROI RO DATA

[Shuttle]

(Riker, Data and Troi are actually wearing
harnesses
to keep them in their seats) 
DATA: Shields are holding, sir. 
RIKER: Wind shear is incredible. Data, keep an eye on the stabilisers.
If it's anything like this on the ground, I don't see how anyone can
survive on this moon for long. 
TROI: Maybe they've been living underground. 
RIKER: Question is where? I still can't locate the source of the damn
signal. It's bouncing around more than we are. 
DATA: Forward thrusters have failed, sir. We are losing power. 
RIKER: Enterprise!

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead. 
RIKER [OC]: We've lost our thrusters. Attempting to compensate with
secondary boosters 
WORF: Sir? The shuttlecraft's impulse generators have shut down. 
PICARD: Commander, can you hear me?

[Shuttle]

PICARD [OC]: Enterprise to shuttle, please respond.

RIKER: Hold on! We're going down. 
DATA: Initiating emergency landing procedures. 
RIKER: Maintain the approach attitude, Data. I'm taking her in. Brace
for impact. 
[Bridge]

RO: The shuttle has crashed on the surface. 
PICARD: Do we have their position? 
WORF: I am picking up the shuttle's trace signature, but the surface
interference is distorting its position. 
PICARD: Can you locate them? 
RO: I think I can. I followed their entry almost all the way in. We can
calculate the coordinates from the angle of descent.
