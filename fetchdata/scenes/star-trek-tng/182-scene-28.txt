JEANLUC RIKER PICARD TROI CHIEF COMPUTER OGAWA CRUSHER DATA TOMALAK

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Computer. Summarise service record. Riker,
William T, Captain. Begin with the Fornax disaster. 
COMPUTER: Please restate question. 
RIKER: Service record, Riker, William T. 
(nothing) 
RIKER: Damn it. 
JEAN-LUC: Dad? 
RIKER: Computer lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running his
diagnostic. 
(finally something comes up on the desk monitor) 
JEAN-LUC: Is that what you wanted? 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Captain Riker. The Romulan Ambassador is ready
to transport over from the Decius. 
RIKER: On my way. I'd better go. 
JEAN-LUC: Sure. Dad. Everything's going to be fine.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How's my
namesake holding up to all this? 
RIKER: Better than I am. 
TROI: We did our best to prepare him. 
RIKER: I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long way
to go. A long way. 
PICARD: Just follow my lead with the Ambassador. You'll be fine.

[Transporter room]

CHIEF: The Decius reports the Ambassador is waiting
to transport. 
RIKER: Beam him aboard. 
(Every one say hi! to Andreas Katsoulis, our favourite Romulan) 
TOMALAK: Admiral Picard, Captain Riker. It's good to see you again. 
PICARD: Ambassador Tomalak. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. 
TOMALAK: Thank you, Admiral. It is an honour to be the first Romulan to
freely walk about a Federation Starship. 
(Tomalak and Picard leave) 
RIKER: Ambassador Tomalak? At Nelvana three, he threatened to take the
hull of the Enterprise home as a war trophy. 
TROI: That was a long time ago. Many things have changed, including
Tomalak.

[Corridor]

TOMALAK: As soon as we arrive at your Outpost
twenty three, the final negotiations should go quickly. 
PICARD: I agree, Ambassador. All of the difficult issues have been
resolved. 
TOMALAK: After much debate. Your Captain Riker is the kind of
negotiator even the Ferengi should avoid. 
PICARD: But we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with,
largely thanks to Captain Riker. 
TOMALAK: And we are grateful, Captain. The new alliance will greatly
benefit my people. 
RIKER: As I hope it will benefit mine. 
TOMALAK: It will, Captain. It will.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Main Bridge. 
TOMALAK: The virus you contracted, Captain. Have you fully recovered? 
PICARD: I assure you Captain Riker is quite well. He's looking forward
to attending the final negotiations as planned. 
TOMALAK: Excellent. The signing of this treaty is an historic occasion.
You, of all people, deserve to be there. 
RIKER: Thank you, Ambassador.

[Bridge]

TOMALAK: So this is the Bridge of the Enterprise.
And this, I assume, is your Tactical position. Impressive. 
RIKER: Excuse me. Admiral, Deanna, I need a moment with you. Commander
Data, if you would accompany the Ambassador on his tour. 
DATA: Certainly, sir. 
RIKER: Excuse us, Ambassador. 
DATA: Ambassador, you may find this of interest. These newly refined
sensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloaked
warbird even at warp.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Are you saying you trust Tomalak? 
PICARD: I trust the process we have built with the Romulans over the
past four years. They have nothing to gain by betrayal. 
RIKER: Are you sure? You've always said it's a chess game with the
Romulans. Move, counter move, guile and deceit.
TROI: I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. His desire for peace is
sincere. He wants this alliance. There is no cause for concern. 
RIKER: No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the location
of Outpost twenty three, the key to all of our defences in the Neutral
Zone. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategic
importance of Outpost twenty three is minimal. Has been for years. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher to Riker. Are you there, Captain? 
RIKER: What is it, Doctor? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Your son has been injured. He's been taken to Sickbay.
You'd better come down here right away.

[Sickbay]

(Young Jean-Luc is having his arm treated) 
JEAN-LUC: Dad. 
RIKER: Are you alright? 
JEAN-LUC: I'm fine. 
RIKER: What happened? 
CRUSHER: It's broken, but it's going to be all right in just a minute.
Now, let's go easy on this arm for a little while, okay? 
RIKER: How'd this happen? 
JEAN-LUC: I was in the gym playing parrises squares. 
RIKER: Parrises squares? 
JEAN-LUC: I fell off the ramp. 
RIKER: At your age? You could break your neck! 
JEAN-LUC: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. 
CRUSHER: Continue the compression attenuator for two more minutes. 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Can I talk to you for a moment? 
RIKER: I'll be right back. 
(they walk away) 
CRUSHER: Will, how old were you when you first started playing parrises
squares? 
RIKER: Alright, I was probably a little younger than he is. It's just
that, for all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father and
he almost kills himself. 
CRUSHER: He didn't almost kill himself. He just broke a wrist, just
like a lot of other boys his age when they fall. 
RIKER: You're right. It's difficult. 
CRUSHER: Difficult for you? What about for Jean-Luc? Can you imagine
how he feels? You've lost sixteen years. Jean-Luc has lost a lot more
than that. First his mother and now his father. 
OGAWA: Good as new, Captain. You can take him home. 
RIKER: Thanks. How's the arm? 
JEAN LUC: It's fine. Dad, I'm really sorry. I mean, I know you've got
more important things to do. 
RIKER: There is nothing more important than this, son.
