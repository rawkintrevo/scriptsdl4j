BEATA RIKER LIATOR BRENNA RIVAN TROI PULASKI MINUET

[Justice - Edo Council Chambers]

RIVAN: Everyone! We've brought the visitors. 
LIATOR: Please, enjoy what we have. 

[11001001 - Bourbon Street Bar]

RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call
enhancement, you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockout
like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this? 
MINUET: Waiting for you. 
RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious? 
MINUET: Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Something wrong? 
TROI: No, it's just that Commander Riker's emotions are rather
passionate. 
PULASKI: As in erotic? 
TROI: Very much so.

MINUET: A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what
I am? 
RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, your
touch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think seem so
real. 
MINUET: Thank you. 
RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? 
MINUET: As real as you need me to be. 
[Angel One - Beata's quarters]

BEATA: You resist. Don't you find me attractive? 
RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. 
BEATA: You attract me like no man ever has. 
RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of
another world. 
BEATA: It's not the reason. 
RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? 
BEATA: I hope so. 
[Up The Long Ladder - Riker's
quarters]

BRENNA: William, is something wrong? 
RIKER: What do you mean? 
BRENNA: Do you not like girls? 
RIKER: Of course I do. Oh, is there a technique to this foot washing? 
BRENNA: You generally start at the top and work your way down. 
RIKER: I think I can handle that. 
BRENNA: I was hoping you might.
