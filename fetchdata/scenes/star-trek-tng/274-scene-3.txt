(A young man in the act of rock climbing nearly
falls over) 
JASON: What the? This is a Federation ship. 
PICARD: That's right. I'm Captain Picard. Jean-Luc Picard. 
JASON: I realise I wasn't supposed to be spelunking that cave, but
don't you have something better to do? 
PICARD: We thought you were at risk. 
JASON: Oh. Well, I wasn't, so maybe you should just beam me back where
I was? 
PICARD: Are you Jason Vigo? 
JASON: I, er, I know him. Is he in trouble? 
PICARD: In a manner of speaking. Someone has made a threat against his
life. Jason, I'm an old friend of your mother's. I'm here because
you're in danger. 
JASON: Why would anybody want to kill me? 
PICARD: The person who has made the threat is under the impression that
you are my son. 
JASON: Am I? 
PICARD: I don't know. 
JASON: My mother never told me who my father was. Just that he was in
Starfleet. 
PICARD: Maybe we should contact her. 
JASON: She died a few years ago. 
PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry. Jason, I think it's important that we find out
one way or another. Would you be willing to permit a genetic test? 
JASON: If I'm not your son, is this person still going to want to kill
me? 
PICARD: I doubt it. 
JASON: In that case, you won't mind my saying that I hope you're not my
father.
