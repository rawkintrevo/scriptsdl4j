RIKER CHORGAN MAROUK PICARD BRULL YUTA COMPUTER CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, I'm afraid the only entry we have
on Volnoth in the Acamarian database is a birth record. 
RIKER: Probably one of the last of the Gatherers to be born on their
planet. 
CRUSHER: Commander? I've been digging through the medical database from
Acamar Three for hours, and I have found another victim of the same
microvirus that killed Volnoth. But only one. Fifty three years ago, a
Gatherer named Penthor-Mul. 
RIKER: Data? Anything in your file on Penthor-Mul? 
DATA: Yes, sir. He was a member of the Lornak clan. He was captured
while leading a Gatherer raid on an Acamarian outpost. He died of a
heart attack before his trial ended. 
RIKER: Display Volnoth's birth record again. 
CRUSHER: Lornak. The same clan. 
RIKER: The only two recorded deaths by this microvirus both from the
same clan. What does that tell us, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: If these microbes were engineered for murder, I'd say somebody
could be going after a whole family. 
DATA: Commander, Chorgan, the present leader of the Gatherers, is also
from the Lornak
clan. 
RIKER: I want to know just how this clan was involved in the Acamarian
blood feuds, and I'd like to know any clue as to who their enemies
were. How could this virus have been transmitted, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: More ways than I can count. And it's perfectly safe to the
carrier as long as he doesn't have the same DNA patterns. 
RIKER: Tailor made for their enemies. 
DATA: Commander, eighty years ago the Lornaks massacred a rival clan,
the Tralestas. It ended a feud that had lasted for two hundred years. 
RIKER: Ended it? 
DATA: According to these records, there were no survivors. The
Tralestas were annihilated. 
CRUSHER: Something tells me they weren't all been wiped out. 
RIKER: There must be a missing link here. 
CRUSHER: Computer, any members of the Acamarian delegation from the
Tralesta clan? 
COMPUTER: Clan affiliation is not within provided records. 
DATA: Sir, I believe I have found a correlation between the two deaths.
Your missing link. That is Penthor-Mul being led from his trial. 
(a still image on the monitor) 
RIKER: I don't see the connection. 
DATA: Behind him and to the left, sir. 
RIKER: Computer, scan left and magnify. 
DATA: The computer can extrapolate and reconstruct the rest of the
face, sir. 
RIKER: Do it. 
(It is Yuta) 

CRUSHER: But that photograph was taken over fifty years ago. 
RIKER: Fifty three years ago, and she hasn't aged a day.

[Chorgan's ship]

MAROUK: Three seats on the ruling council? 
CHORGAN: If we're going to be subject to your laws, we want a part in
making it. 
MAROUK: Well I agree you're entitled to representation but not on the
ruling council. 
CHORGAN: Unacceptable. The real power is in the council. You're
shutting us off already. 
MAROUK: No! You're trying to take too much! No group has three seats on
the council. 
CHORGAN: I don't care what others have. 
MAROUK: You only care about what you can take. 
PICARD: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you would
be demanding equal levels of representation. 
MAROUK: You're right, Captain. I apologise for my temper. 
PICARD: Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. 
CHORGAN: I agree. Maybe a little touch of that brandy? 
MAROUK: Yuta. 
PICARD: You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike the
two of you actually are. 
CHORGAN: That's ridiculous. 
MAROUK: Really, Captain. 
PICARD: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strong
leaders. 
BRULL: We don't obey weak leaders. 
CHORGAN: We have nothing in common at all. We haven't agreed to
anything. 
PICARD: You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have some brandy
together. 
(Yuta is serving Marouk when Riker beams in. He has to stun a Gatherer
guard) 
RIKER: Don't move! 
CHORGAN: A Federation trap! 
PICARD: Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason for
his actions. You do, Number One? 
RIKER: Yuta. Move away from Chorgan. Do it. 
YUTA: Why? 
RIKER: Because of a man you once knew named Penthar-Mul. 
CHORGAN: Penthar-Mul? How do you know Penthar-Mul? 
RIKER: Tell him, Yuta. 
YUTA: I don't understand. 
RIKER: You were with Penthar-Mul when he died. 
YUTA: It was fifty years ago. How could I? 
RIKER: I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life is
in danger. Step back, Yuta. 
YUTA: William, this is not your concern. 
RIKER: It is now. You're about to commit a murder. 
YUTA: It isn't murder. It's justice. 
CHORGAN: Who are you? 
YUTA: Yuta of the clan Tralesta. 
CHORGAN: There are no more Tralestas. 
YUTA: Five survived the last Lornak raid. But on that day, a century
ago, my life ended and my search began. I was the one chosen,
transformed. My cells were altered, my aging slowed, enough to finish
my task. 
MAROUK: You used me in order to get to the last few you couldn't reach.

YUTA: Yes, Sovereign. 
CHORGAN: You will never leave this ship alive. 
YUTA: You're the last. Once you're dead, what happens to me doesn't
matter. 
RIKER: The wars are over, Yuta. 
YUTA: You cannot understand. 
RIKER: You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you that
regrets what you've become. Listen to me. You don't have to do this any
more. 
YUTA: I have no choice. 
RIKER: You do. 
YUTA: William, I. I'm sorry. 
RIKER: Stop. 
(The first shot is a mild stun. Yuta staggers, then reaches for Chorgan
again. The next shot is higher. Then Riker puts the phaser up to full
power) 
RIKER: Yuta, don't do this. 
(She moves towards Chorgan again, and Riker vapourises her) 
CHORGAN: Commander, I am in your debt.
