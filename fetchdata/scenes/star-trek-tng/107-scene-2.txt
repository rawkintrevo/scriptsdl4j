RIKER: Bottom line, La Forge. 
LAFORGE: It's not good, sir. The Ferengi forcefield that holds this
ship compensates almost as fast as we can increase power. 
RIKER: Almost? 
LAFORGE: Well, there's a point three hundred seventy two millisecond
delay between use of our power and the
neutralising counter force of the Ferengi. See, we push and they push
back in equal force, sir. 
RIKER: What's our acceleration delay between slow-reverse impulse and
top warp speed? 
LAFORGE: That's point three-hundred milliseconds. There's (realisation)
Ah, I see where you're going. We shift down and then kick hard into
warp nine. Yeah! Come back fighting! whooey! 
RIKER: Can we do it, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Ask me after it's done, sir. (to engineer) I want a slow
reverse into drop off over five minutes. We'll show them what this baby
can do, sir. 
RIKER: Give me everything you've got. 
LAFORGE: Aye, aye, sir.

RIKER: In a sudden, abrupt power surge to high warp
speed, Captain, we may be able to break loose from that Ferengi
forcefield. 
PICARD: I wonder what they're thinking over there. 
RIKER: They're wondering what we're going to do next. 
WORF: I say fight, sir. There's nothing shameful in falling before a
superior enemy. 
(La Forge enters) 
PICARD: And nothing shameful in a strategic retreat, either. 
LAFORGE: All systems ready, Captain. And communication now restored to
Engineering. 
PICARD: Excellent, La Forge. Now let's, er, let's throw them off guard.
Lieutenant Yar. Open hailing frequencies. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: At least we won't begin with weakness. Attention Ferengi
starship! This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. In the
name of the United Federation of Planets, I demand you return the T9
energy converter you removed from Gamma Tauri Four. Send that in all
language forms. 
TASHA: All language forms, sir. 
PICARD: Sometimes, Riker, the best way to win a fight is not to be
there. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. He will triumph who knows when to fight and when not
to fight. 
PICARD: Glad the Academy's still teaches the strategies of Sun Tzu.
This delay had better prove out, LaForge. 
LAFORGE: Point three hundred milliseconds, sir. 
PICARD: Let's blast full power into warp nine. Ready? 
LAFORGE: On your command, Captain. 
PICARD: On a count of three. Stand by on phasers. One, set warp to
nine. Two, divert shield power to the main engines. Three. 
(Everything vibrates, but they don't leave) 
PICARD: Merde. Shields up. 
DATA: Captain, I think you had better see this. 
PICARD: What's wrong? 
DATA: Someone is reading every file, every bit of information stored in
the Enterprise memory banks. 
LAFORGE: They can do that? 
DATA: And more, perhaps. 
TROI: Captain, if I may recommend? With our attention on the Ferengi
vessel, we have ignored the planet. 
PICARD: Data, consult the charts on this planet. See what we've got on
it. Conference evaluation.
