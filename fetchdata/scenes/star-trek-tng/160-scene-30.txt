LAFORGE CREWMAN WESLEY PICARD KATIK WORF FINN CRUSHER DATA

[Infirmary]

KATIK: Finn, everyone is being rounded up. 
FINN: Because of her? 
KATIK: The Federation wants to negotiate her release. 
FINN: While they arrange for the Rutian police to fill up the detention
cells. 
KATIK: A Starfleet officer is working with the director. He wants a
meeting with you. 
FINN: I'm sure he does. Your Federation colleagues have engineered mass
arrests to pressure me into releasing you. 
CRUSHER: I'm sure you've misunderstood. 
FINN: They're working with the police. He's seen it with his own eyes. 
CRUSHER: All they want is to get me back safely. 
FINN: I'm not releasing you. I need you here. 
CRUSHER: To find a way to reverse the effects of the dimensional shift?
I can do that right now. Stop using it! I have a life, Finn. I have a
son who needs me. 
FINN: Is your son on the ship? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
FINN: I'm sorry he's on the ship. 
CRUSHER: No. 
FINN: They have joined forces with the Rutians against us. 
CRUSHER: We are not your enemy. 
FINN: They are more valuable to me than an enemy. For seventy years we
have shouted, and no one's heard us. Destroy the Federation flagship,
someone will listen. 
CRUSHER: Please. 
FINN: They are the ones who interfered. They are the ones who sent
medical supplies. They are the ones who organised mass arrests. They
are killing your son, not me. 
CRUSHER: Please, Finn, don't do this. I will do anything you ask. 
FINN: I had a son, too. He was thirteen when he died in detention.

WORF: Intruders in Engineering 
DATA: Casualties reported on deck twelve. Sickbay responding. 
PICARD: Seal off all decks. Lock on transporters to the intruder
signals. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Intruder signals unstable, Captain, I cannot lock on. 
DATA: They are moving inter-dimensionally. Neither transporters nor
forcefields will contain them, sir.

[Engineering]

jump out. Geordi has seen them) 
LAFORGE: Explosive charge on the main warp chamber. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on the
explosive device and energise. 
CREWMAN [OC]: It's scrambling the sensors, Captain. I can't pinpoint
it. 
PICARD: Begin emergency evacuation. Stand by for saucer separation,
Mister La Forge, can you remove the charge from the engine core? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I'm trying. Hold on.
