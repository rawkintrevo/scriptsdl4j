TASHA: Captain. Deanna. 
PICARD: Did you have any idea, Lieutenant, that Lutan was suddenly

TROI: How simple all this would be without the Prime Directive. 
PICARD: That thought had passed through my mind, Counsellor.

TROI: But the vaccine is important in this case, sir. 
PICARD: Counsellor, you're the last person I'd expect to argue in
favour of accepting the challenge. 
TROI: Betazoid blood is also practical, Captain. The odds are very good
she'd defeat Lutan's wife easily and you would win all the bargaining
points you need. 
PICARD: The odds are. 
TROI: You have pointed out yourself we are all at risk every day of
every mission. 
PICARD: I want some explanations from Lutan.
