[Turbolift]

JEAN-LUC: Deck eight. 
RIKER: Halt. I know how hard this is for you. 
JEAN-LUC: It's okay, Dad. 
RIKER: No, okay's not good enough. When I was your age, my own father
he wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wondered
what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea even
scared me a little. 
JEAN-LUC: Scared? You? 
RIKER: Yeah. But I guess I got over it. You're here. Resume. It's
important to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. 
JEAN-LUC: You never have, Dad. You've always been there for me. 
RIKER: I'll have to take your word for that because I don't remember
any of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want to
remember. I guess there's only one thing we can do. We've got to build
some new memories. 
[Corridor]

RIKER: I'm not sure it's still in the memory banks,
but I used to have a great fishing
programme on the holodeck. 
JEAN-LUC: The Curtis Creek programme? 
RIKER: You know it? 
JEAN-LUC: Sure. We've gone to Curtis Creek lots of times. 
RIKER: Would you like to go again? 
JEAN-LUC: You bet. 
RIKER: Well as soon as these negotiations are out of the way, you and I
are going fishing. 
JEAN-LUC: Great!

[Riker's quarters]

JEAN-LUC: And then Mom tried to net the fish, and
she fell in the creek, too. And then you tried to pull us both out, and
you fell in. 
RIKER: I'm not sure I want to remember that. 
JEAN-LUC: Mom really liked Curtis Creek. We went there for picnics and
stuff lots of times. 
RIKER: What was she like? 
JEAN-LUC: She was great. I think of her a lot. I'd better go change. 
RIKER: Computer. Display family record. Riker. William T. Limit to
visual. 
(the wall monitor shows a movie of Riker and young J-L having fun) 
RIKER: Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. 
COMPUTER: Please restate request. 
RIKER: Damn. 
JEAN-LUC: What's wrong, Dad? 
RIKER: The computer still isn't working properly. I can't get a visual
of your mother. 
JEAN-LUC: But I know Mom's pictures are there. Did you give a stardate?
Computer. Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. Home file.
Stardate 58416. 
(a movie of J-L's 7th birthday, and the woman is a brunette last seen
in a season one episode...) 
RIKER: Min! Minuet. 
JEAN-LUC: Mom was beautiful, wasn't she? 
RIKER: Yes. 
JEAN-LUC: What's wrong, Dad? 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Riker. 
RIKER: Riker here. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, please come to the Bridge. 
RIKER: On my way.

[Bridge]

RIKER: What's the problem? 
LAFORGE: I've had to shut down the warp engines, Captain. 
RIKER: Why? 
LAFORGE: Antimatter containment fields are fluctuating. It's nothing to
worry about though. 
RIKER: We're on the edge of the Neutral Zone on impulse power, and
you're not concerned? 
LAFORGE: I'll have the engines back online in no time, sir. 
RIKER: Like you tracked down that faulty processing accelerator? 
LAFORGE: I'm running a level one diagnostic. 
RIKER: For thirty hours? It would never take you more than four. You're
incapable of that level of incompetence, Mister La Forge. Worf, where
did you get that scar? 
WORF: In combat. 
RIKER: What battle? When? Which sector? Which unit? Mister Data, if we
left immediately, when would we arrive at Outpost twenty three? 
DATA: (thinks) At warp one, in three days, four hours. 
RIKER: How about at warp seven? (pause) At warp eight? At warp nine?
What's the matter, Data? What happened to those millions of
calculations per second? 
DATA: Pardon me, sir. I am experiencing subspace interference which
limits my abilities. I can't operate as quickly as 
RIKER: What did you say? 
DATA: I said I cannot operate 
RIKER: No! That's not what you said. You said I can't. You used a
contraction, didn't you? 
DATA: Sir, I can explain if you would just give me a moment. 
RIKER: No you can't. Don't even try. 
(Picard, Troi and Tomalak have come out of the ready room) 
PICARD: Captain, perhaps it would be best if we discussed this 
RIKER: Shut up! 
PICARD: I beg your pardon? 
RIKER: I said, shut up. As in close your mouth and stop talking. 
TROI: Will, I sense how upset you are. You're angry and impatient. 
RIKER: Deanna, back off. Well, would anyone else like to speak up? Or
shall we end this charade? 
TOMALAK: As you wish, Commander Riker. 
[Romulan Holodeck]

TOMALAK: The charade is over. 
[Control room]

(a technician is running a scanner over Riker,
returning his uniform and appearance to normal) 
RIKER: The Enterprise? my son you created it all. 
TOMALAK: With the help of our neural scanners and what you would call a
holodeck. Now, please tell me. How did you discover the truth? The
future we constructed for you should have been convincing. 
RIKER: It wasn't. There was a computer time lag, for one thing. 
TOMALAK: Unavoidable. Our scanners have a limited response time, so
whenever you strayed from our expectations. But surely that was not
enough to 
RIKER: To smash your house of cards? No. It was the visual record of my
wife, Minuet. Bad move. 
TOMALAK: But we chose someone from your past who is still alive. A
woman you were extremely attracted to 
RIKER: Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet was nothing more than a computer
generated fantasy I once experienced on another holodeck. 
TOMALAK: Impossible. In your mind that woman exists, physically. Your
feelings toward her remain quite passionate. 
RIKER: She was part of a very special programme. 
TOMALAK: So much effort, so little accomplished. 
RIKER: If it was Outpost twenty three you were after, why didn't you
use your neural scanners to probe my mind? 
TOMALAK: Our scanners are calibrated for Romulan brain patterns. When
it comes to human brains, they are less efficient. There were gaps in
the information we gathered from your memory. 
RIKER: Gaps? From what I saw, I find that hard to believe. You
recreated the Enterprise, the crew, every nuance and smell, sound, with
perfect accurate. I didn't see any gaps. I don't buy it, Tomalak. 
TOMALAK: We're wasting time. Bring him.

[Tunnel]

(obviously artificial, with computer panels on the
walls) 
TOMALAK: When you and your colleagues transported to this planet, you
were less than a kilometre from this base. Your capture was a simple
matter. 
RIKER: My colleagues, where are they? 
TOMALAK: We allowed them to transport safely back to the Enterprise,
but your signal was diverted. 
RIKER: My people won't stop looking for me, Tomalak. 
TOMALAK: They already have. 
(He drops the forcefield on a room) 
TOMALAK: Please, say hello to your son. 
[Holding cell]

(Riker enters the comfortably furnished cell.
Tomalak and the guard stay outside) 
RIKER: Jean-Luc? 
TOMALAK: That is not his name, of course, nor have you ever really met
him. We merely used his image to augment your
programme. 
RIKER: What have you done to him? 
TOMALAK: While I am gone, please give careful thought to your
situation. 
(the forcefield goes back up, and the Romulans leave) 
RIKER: What's your name? 
(the boy backs away from him) 
RIKER: Whoa. If we're going to get out of here, you're going to have to
trust me. Easy, I'm not going to hurt you. Who are you? How did you get
here? My name is Will. 
ETHAN: Ethan. They brought me here with my parents. We were at a
research station on Miridian six. 
RIKER: Miridian six? On the edge of the Neutral Zone? I thought that
was uninhabited. 
ETHAN: The station was set up last year. Then the Romulans came. 
RIKER: It's odd that the Enterprise wasn't advised. Where are your
parents now? 
ETHAN: They took them away. 
RIKER: Do you know why the Romulans are keeping you here? 
ETHAN: No. I just want to get away. 
RIKER: I'll get us out of here, Ethan. 
ETHAN: How? Even if we do get away, they'll find us. They found me when
I escaped before. 
RIKER: You escaped? 
ETHAN: Yes. I hid in a secret place for weeks, but they caught me when
I came out to find food. 
(Tomalak and a guard storm back in) 
TOMALAK: I want that information, Commander. I want the location of
Outpost twenty three. Very well. I have been given permission to use
whatever means are necessary 
(Ethan makes a run for it through the open door) 
RIKER: Ethan, no! 
TOMALAK: Stop him! 
(Riker punches Tomalak, then gets the guard off Ethan and takes his
weapon)
