RIKER OBRIEN TACTICS WORF PICARD KLAG DATA KARGAN

[Bridge]

WORF: Forty thousand.

[Pagh Bridge]

KLAG: Forty thousand kilometres. 
KARGAN: Prepare to drop cloaking shields, and fire when ready. Steady. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, energise.

[Pagh Bridge]

(Captain Kargan is beamed away) 
RIKER: Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Captain Kargan. He was
acting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Serve this ship
as I have!

[Bridge]

KARGAN: Where am I? 
PICARD: You're on board the starship Enterprise. 
KARGAN: Riker has no honour. He tricked me! 
(He turns to shoot Picard, but Worf shoots him first) 
DATA: He's only dazed, sir. 
PICARD: Well that's fine, but where's Commander Riker?

[Pagh Bridge]

RIKER: Cloaking shields off. Obey my orders. 
TACTICS: We will be destroyed. 
RIKER: If we are, it will be in battle, and I will die with you. So I
repeat, cloaking shields off!

[Bridge]

WORF: It is the Pagh, sir. 
DATA: It has all armament locked on us and ready to fire. 
PICARD: Hold this position. Hailing frequencies. Calling the Pagh. This
is the Enterprise. We are here to assist. Do not fire. 
KARGAN: They will not believe you.

[Pagh Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Pagh, we're here to assist. Do you
read me? 
[Bridge]

RIKER [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, this is Captain
William Riker of the Klingon vessel, Pagh. I order you to lower your
shields and surrender. 
PICARD: Lower shields. Surrender, as ordered. 
KARGAN: I demand to be beamed back aboard my vessel! 
PICARD: Transporter Chief, prepare to beam Captain Kargan back aboard
the Pagh. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Captain Riker, we can carry out your repairs immediately. 
RIKER: Thank you, Captain Picard.

[Pagh Bridge]

KARGAN: You should have killed me. 
RIKER: I don't want your command. 
KARGAN: But you tricked me to get it. 
RIKER: Either way, you can have it back. 
KARGAN: Then return to your station. 
(Riker holds his ground, so Kargan gives him a massive back-hander that
sends him flying. Klag checks his injuries) 
KARGAN: Get him off my ship! 
KLAG: Yes, Captain. You understand the Klingons better than I thought,
Commander. 
RIKER: Thank you, my friend.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: That might have been one of the shortest
assignments in the history of Starfleet. 
PICARD: Wrong, Number One. It was almost the longest. Well done. 
RIKER: Thank you. Actually, I learned quite a bit. 
PICARD: Apparently, not when to duck. 
RIKER: When not to duck would be more accurate. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard, Number One. Now, Lieutenant, conduct the
Commander to Sickbay. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Commander?
