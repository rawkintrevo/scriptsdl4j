PICARD RIKER

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Riker enters) 
PICARD: Fermat's last theorem. You're familiar with it? 
RIKER: Vaguely. I spent too many math classes daydreaming about being
on a starship. 
PICARD: When Pierre de Fermat died they found this equation scrawled in
the margin of his notes. X to the nth plus Y to the nth equals Z to the
nth, where n is greater than 2, which he said had no solution in whole
numbers. But he also added this phrase.
Remarkable proof. 
RIKER: Yeah, that's starting to come back to me. There was no proof
included. 
PICARD: For the eight hundred years people have been trying to solve
it. 
RIKER: Including you. 
PICARD: I find it stimulating. Also, it puts things in perspective. In
our arrogance we feel we are so advanced, and yet we cannot unravel a
simple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone,
without a computer. 
RIKER: Captain, we've detected some sort of debris in a loose orbit. 
PICARD: Can you identify it? 
RIKER: No, sir. I suggest we beam a section aboard for analysis. 
PICARD: Make it so, Number One.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: We've locked onto something with markings on
it. 
PICARD: What sort of markings? 
RIKER: Uncertain. Energise. 
(O'Brien beams a piece of curved metal construction aboard. He and
Riker go to the pad and turn it's outer surface to face us. Lo and
behold, a US flag and the letters NASA. The camera drools over it
lovingly. Why couldn't it be ESA for once?) 
PICARD: We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. 
RIKER: Yes sir. I think we have.
