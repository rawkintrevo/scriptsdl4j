in the Nebula as soon as they appear.

us.

DATA: Sir, the vessel being piloted by Lieutenant
Ro is firing a low intensity particle beam into the nebula. 
PICARD: What the hell is she doing? 
DATA: The polarising effect being created by the beam may make it
possible for us to be detected. 
PICARD: Can you counter the effect? 
DATA: I will attempt to do so.
