(at the science station) 
DATA: I have scanned the entire Prytt communications system. This
appears to be the primary access module for the central government. 
RIKER: Can you determine which of the comm. links is connected to the
Prime Minister's office? 
DATA: I believe so, sir. However, the Prytt have no link designed for
extraterritorial communication. Our hail may come as a quite surprise
to them. 
RIKER: Well, they're going to have to adjust. Open a channel. 
GUEST2 [OC]: This is Prime Minister Horath's headquarters. How can I be
of service? 
RIKER: This is Commander William T. Riker, Federation starship
Enterprise. I know this may seem an unusual way 
GUEST2 [OC]: The Enterprise? You mean the ship in orbit? 
RIKER: That's right. 
GUEST2 [OC]: Why are you on this comm. link? 
RIKER: We're having trouble contacting your government directly. We had
to start somewhere. If you would let me talk to your 
GUEST2 [OC]: Did you get authorisation for this communication from the
Security Ministry? 
RIKER: As I said, we're having trouble contacting you 
GUEST2 [OC]: I cannot participate in an unauthorised communication. This
transmission is terminated. 
RIKER: Not very friendly, are they? 
DATA: No, sir. 
WORF: Sir, we are being hailed. It is the Prytt Security Council. 
RIKER: Well, it looks like we got someone's attention. On screen. 
GUEST3 [on monitor]: Enterprise, this is Security Minister Lorin. You
will immediately cease all attempts at communication with our people. 
RIKER: Minister, we've been attempting to contact someone in your
government. It appears that you have detained two of our officers. We
would like to discuss the situation. 
GUEST3 [on monitor]: There is nothing to discuss. If you do not
terminate these transmissions, we will be forced to take aggressive
action against your ship. 
(transmission ends, Mauric enters) 
WORF: Their weapon systems pose no threat to the Enterprise. 
RIKER: Just the same, let's keep the shields up for the time being. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
GUEST1: Is there a problem, Commander? 
RIKER: Our efforts with the Prytt just ran into a wall. 
GUEST1: I'm sorry. But perhaps this will brighten your spirits. We have
freed your Captain and doctor. 
RIKER: What? 
GUEST1: They were being held in prison just outside the Prytt capital.
One of our operatives was able to arrange their escape. 
WORF: Where are they now? 
GUEST1: Well, they should be en route to the Kes border. Our operative
provided them with a detailed map and instructions on where to go. 
RIKER: How will you get them across the border? 
GUEST1: At the moment, that information is confidential, but trust us,
we do have a plan. 
RIKER: Ambassador, I'm afraid I must insist that you provide us with
more information. 
GUEST1: I understand your concern, of course, but I would feel more
comfortable discussing these operational details in a less public
environment. 
RIKER: Certainly. We can step into the Ready room. 
GUEST1: I would prefer the quarters you provided me. They're safer. 
RIKER: All right.
