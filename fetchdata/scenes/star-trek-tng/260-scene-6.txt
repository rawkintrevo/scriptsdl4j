RIKER LORIN WORF PICARD DATA CRUSHER KES

[Transporter room]

WORF: Captain. Doctor. I have the coordinates of
Ambassador Mauric's chambers. 
PICARD: Let's not keep them waiting, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Enterprise to Kes Security Relay Station One. We're ready to
commence transport. 
KES [OC]: Acknowledged, Enterprise. We have lowered our defense shield.

WORF: Confirmed. 
PICARD: Energise. 
(Picard and Crusher are beamed away, and Worf starts to leave) 
KES [OC]: This is Security Relay Station One. We are ready to receive
your Captain and Medical Officer. 
WORF: This is the Enterprise. We have completed the transport sequence.
You should have them. 
KES [OC]: Negative, Enterprise. They are not here.

[Cell]

(Picard wakes up on a hard floor) 
PICARD: Beverly. Beverly. 
CRUSHER: What happened? 
PICARD: I don't know. 
CRUSHER: The last thing I remember we were beginning to transport. 
PICARD: I would assume we must be on Kesprytt. We're in some kind of
prison cell. The question is, why? I can't imagine that Ambassador
Mauric would have any reason to detain us. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: Let me see. 
PICARD: What? 
(there's something sticking out of the back of his neck) 
CRUSHER: It looks like an implant. It seems to be connected directly to
the brainstem. 
(She's got one under her hair as well) 
PICARD: Some kind of coercive device? 
CRUSHER: Whatever it is I doubt it's designed for our health. 
(the doors open and security in dark one-piece suits with hoods enter) 
PICARD: What is going on here? 
CRUSHER: If you tell us why you've taken us hostage, we might be able
to 
LORIN: (female) You are not hostages. You are prisoners. 
PICARD: Prisoners on whose authority? 
LORIN: You are being held under the authority of the Prytt Security
Ministry. The charges are conspiring with the enemy. 
PICARD: Enemy? You mean the Kes. 
LORIN: We're not fools. We are aware of the Federation attempt to
establish a military alliance with the Kes. It will not be tolerated. 
PICARD: Your information is incorrect. We have no plans to enter into
any 
LORIN: There is no point in trying to mislead us, Captain. The devices
which have been implanted in your cerebral cortexes will soon be
calibrated to your psi-wave pattern. At that time, we will be able to
get all the information we need. 
PICARD: And then you'll discover that we're telling the truth. 
LORIN: We shall see.

[Transporter room]

DATA: There is nothing wrong with the transporter.
I have run a complete diagnostic of all the targeting components. 
RIKER: Then what happened to the Captain and Doctor Crusher? 
WORF: Commander. The Transporter sensor log shows an unusual
concentration of antigraviton particles in the emitter coil. 
DATA: A concentration of antigraviton particles suggests a tractor
beam. It might have deflected the transporter beam to a different set
of coordinates. 
RIKER: Is there a way to locate those coordinates? 
DATA: The tractor beam originated somewhere in the Prytt Alliance. 
WORF: Why does the Prytt want Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher? 
RIKER: I don't know. And it's not going to be easy to find out. The
Prytt have consistently refused all outside contact. We're going to
have to work through the Kes. Contact Ambassador Mauric. Tell him I
want a meeting right now. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Cell]

(Picard is testing the bars on the window very
carefully) 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: What? 
PICARD: You're staring at me. 
CRUSHER: I was just thinking about how to get out of here. 
PICARD: There may be a structural flaw that would allow us to escape. 
CRUSHER: Right. 
PICARD: Beverly, the important thing during any confinement is to think
positively and not give up hope. There is a way out of every box, there
is a solution to every puzzle. It's just a matter of finding it. 
(the guard puts a covered plate on the floor and backs out. Picard
fails to stop the door closing again) 
PICARD: Damn. 
CRUSHER: Well, at least this means we won't starve to death. 
PICARD: It means they plan on keeping us here for a while. 
CRUSHER: I'm beginning to think negatively, Jean-Luc. 
(she takes the cover off the plate) 
CRUSHER: My tricorder! 
PICARD: Does it work? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Except something's been added to the main directory. 
PICARD: It's a map. 
CRUSHER: An escape route. That guard must be working for the Kes. 
PICARD: Possibly. Or it could be part of a very carefully laid trap. 
CRUSHER: If you ask me, I'd like to take my chances out there. 
PICARD: Agreed. Is there a way to open the cell door? 
CRUSHER: Yes, the code's been entered. 
(the door opens, there's no one around, and off they go)
