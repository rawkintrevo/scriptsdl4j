RIKER: Over here, Doctor. 
PULASKI: Fill me in. 
RIKER: I was walking along minding my own business, doing a simple
geological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. 
PULASKI: Any pain? 
RIKER: No. Just a little numb, that's all. 
PULASKI: Do you know what it was that stuck you? 
LAFORGE: We've been looking for it. No luck. 
PULASKI: Well, whatever it was, it left something behind. I'm going to
take you up to Sickbay. O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski. 
[Transporter room]

PULASKI [OC]: Medical override is authorised. 
O'BRIEN: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

RIKER: This is the strangest feeling. My whole leg
just went dead. 
Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1. During a
geological survey on Surata Four, Commander Riker has become infected
by an unidentified microbe.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? 
RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd give
her a challenge. 
PULASKI: That you did. The Commander's nervous system has been invaded
by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with the
elements of both. There's the point of entry. The microbes are
infecting the great sciatic nerve, and they are multiplying at an
incredible rate. There. 
PICARD: Can you remove it? 
PULASKI: Not surgically. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining
at the molecular level. 
RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extract
it. 
PULASKI: There's no evidence of nerve damage, but the organisms are
impeding nervous function. 
RIKER: My leg's still asleep. 
PICARD: Prognosis? 
PULASKI: The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the
brain. 
PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? 
PULASKI: Commander Riker could die. 
PICARD: How can I help? 
PULASKI: I need to know more about its composition. 
PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. 
PULASKI: Exactly. 
PICARD: Commander Data, Mister La Forge, prepare to beam down to the
planet. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

DATA: I must reiterate, it would be better if I
went alone. 
LAFORGE: Don't like my company? 
DATA: Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to the
microorganism is. 
LAFORGE: I'll watch where I step. Besides, how do we know that this bug
doesn't like androids more than it likes humans? 
DATA: Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us?

LAFORGE: Because I know exactly where Commander Riker was when it
happened. 
DATA: Mister O'Brien, energise. 
[Steamy mangrove swamp]

LAFORGE: He was right over here. 
DATA: I am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres. However, I
am reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilised. 
LAFORGE: A graveyard? 
DATA: I do not know. 
LAFORGE: Data, that a look at this. 
(an external root) 
DATA: The structure is rhizomatous. 
LAFORGE: Careful. 
DATA: I am always careful. 
DATA: It appears to be dead. 
LAFORGE: I'm not so sure. I can see thermal variations. Let it go for a
second, Data. Let's try something. Perhaps it likes humans more than
androids. 
DATA: If you are correct, you are placing yourself in grave danger. 
LAFORGE: I'm counting on those great android reflexes of yours. 
(Even as he spoke, the root moved towards Geordi, and Data grabbed it) 
LAFORGE: That must be what we're looking for. 
DATA: I would tend to agree. 
(Geordi phasers the wicked thorn from the side of the root. This seems
to hurt the plant) 
LAFORGE: Stand by, O'Brien. Got it. Energise!
