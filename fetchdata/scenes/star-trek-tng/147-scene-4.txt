[Engineering]


(Adjustments
are being made
to something on the warp
core.) 
LAFORGE:
Another millimetre. That's it. A little more. There. That's
excellent. 
RIKER: Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. 
RIKER: You've heard of the simulation aboard the Hathaway? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and the best of luck to you. I've researched the old
Avidyne engines. They're archaic by our standards, very touchy. 
(The first of many Buckaroo Banzai references in this story) 
RIKER: Anticipating the worst, do you think they can be whipped into
shape in forty eight hours? 
LAFORGE: I've already taken the liberty of putting together a few
necessities.

[Worf's
quarters]

(He
seems to be building a
matchstick ship, The door
chime makes him break a
stick.)
WORF:
Enter! 
RIKER: Am I disturbing you? 
(Worf sweeps the wreckage off the desk)
WORF: Just finished. 
RIKER: You know of the simulation. What do you think? 
WORF: Waste of time. 
RIKER: It's just designed to be an exercise. 
WORF: Useless. If there is nothing to lose, no sacrifice, then there is
nothing to gain. 
RIKER: You mean besides pride. Well, in this case it doesn't matter. I
probably haven't got a chance. 
WORF: There is always a chance. 
RIKER: Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon system, even in a
computer mock-up, can't hope to defeat the Enterprise. 
WORF: Well, still 
RIKER: You're out-manned, you're out-gunned, you're out-equipped. What
else have you got? 
WORF: Guile. 
RIKER: Join me. 
WORF: The honour is to serve.
