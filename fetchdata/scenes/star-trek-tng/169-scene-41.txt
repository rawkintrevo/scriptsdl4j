LAFORGE [OC]: And have been spreading it around the
ship. 
RIKER: Working theories are fine, Geordi. 
[Corridor]

RIKER [OC]: But we need a working solution in about
five minutes. 
LAFORGE: Understood, Commander. We're on our way to cargo bay five for
confirmation.

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Nothing on the tricorder. 
COMPUTER: Danger. Exceeding safety limits of engine containment field.
At current acceleration, structural failure will occur in three minutes
thirty seconds. 
LAFORGE: If it's in there it should show up on one of the polarity
channels. 
(Barclay puts his gloved hand into a container. They detect sparkles on
it) 
BARCLAY: There it is. 
LAFORGE: Duffy and O'Brien picked up the broken canister and became
contaminated. 
BARCLAY: If we can get it, the invidium, down to minus two hundred
degrees Celsius, it'll become inert. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. Invidium has been confirmed.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Recommend we flood the injector
pathway conduit with gaseous cryonetrium. That ought to neutralise it. 
PICARD: The question is, will the injectors come back online? 
LAFORGE [OC]: They sustained considerable damage, Captain. I can't
guarantee that we'll be able to regain control. 
RIKER: We don't have much choice, do we? 
LAFORGE [OC]: No, sir. 
PICARD: Make it so.

[Engineering]

DUFFY: Route primary coupling through starboard
transfer conduit. 
WESLEY: Routing. Ready for engine core injection. 
COMPUTER: At current acceleration, structural failure will occur in
forty five seconds.

[Bridge]

DATA: Injector conduit temperature minus one
hundred degrees Celsius. 
PICARD: Transfer injector control to manual. 
DATA: Ready, sir. Temperature now minus one hundred ninety degrees.
Minus two hundred degrees, sir. 
RIKER: Injector status? 
DATA: Matter injector is online. Antimatter injector still locked. 
COMPUTER: At current acceleration, structural failure will occur in
thirty seconds. 
PICARD: Cycle power through ventral relay. 
DATA: Antimatter injector online. Reducing flow capacity. Commencing
warp engine shut down, sir. 
PICARD: Stand down from red alert. 
RIKER: Nice work, Geordi.
