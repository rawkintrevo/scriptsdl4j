AQUIEL RIKER LAFORGE WORF MORAG

[Aquiel's quarters]

(the Canar is glowing, changing colour, and La
Forge is grinning) 
AQUIEL: Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I can see you. Oh. And I can feel you. 
[Morag's quarters]

(Worf enters, phaser drawn) 
WORF: Do not move. 
MORAG: What is this? 
WORF: You will come with me.

[Aquiel's quarters]

AQUIEL: You've never been as close to someone as
you're about to be. Think of me. 
(the door opens. Geordi grabs for his visor as Riker gestures with his
phaser) 
RIKER: Step away from him, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: What are you doing, Commander? 
RIKER: That may not be Lieutenant Uhnari. 
LAFORGE: What? 
AQUIEL: What are you saying? 
RIKER: Step away now.

Medical Officer's Log, supplemental. Commander
Morag and Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept under close observation. So
far, no sign of coalescent behaviour has surfaced.

[La Forge's quarters]

RIKER: Aquiel and Morag will be transferred to a
secure medical facility at Starbase twelve. Maybe we'll know more by
the time we get there. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, right. 
RIKER: It could be Morag. We don't know for sure. 
LAFORGE: Sure. 
RIKER: Get some rest. You've had a rough couple of days. 
LAFORGE: Thanks. 
(Riker leaves) 
LAFORGE: Computer, display the Engineering duty roster for the next
three days. 
(Maura sits and watches then starts worrying at his trousers) 
LAFORGE: Maura, come on, not now. Maura, I said not now. Come on, give
me a break here. Go lay down! 
(the dog does, then there's a strange sound) 
LAFORGE: Maura? 
(the dog is turning into orange gloop. Geordi scrambles across the room
and gets a phaser from a drawer. He fires, then ups the power and fires
again. Eventually the gloop is destroyed)
