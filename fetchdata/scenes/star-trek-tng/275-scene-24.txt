TROI WORF CONDUCTOR PICARD RUSTIC GANGSTER DATA LAFORGE

[Holodeck - train]

(things have changed. A flapper is repeatedly
tapping a goblet against the knight's helm. The gunslinger is tied up
while the gangster plays cards with him.)
WORF: Welcome aboard, Counsellor. 
DATA: If you will distract these people, I will attempt to depolarise
the power grid. 
(Troi and Worf go over the rustic and the other flapper who are working
on the jigsaw) 
WORF: Excuse me. Have you finished the puzzle yet? 
RUSTIC: Not yet, but we're gettin' close. 
WORF: Do you recognise it? 
TROI: No. 
WORF: I would like to help. Tell me. What exactly are you making? 
RUSTIC: What do you think we're making? A puzzle! 
WORF: No, I meant the picture. What is it? 
RUSTIC: Well, I don't know. 
(Troi goes to the card game) 
TROI: Can you deal me in? 
GANGSTER: Sorry. It's a two man game. 
(Troi reaches for the brick)
GANGSTER: Hey! Get your hand off of that. 
TROI: Is that why you killed the Engineer? To get this brick? 
GANGSTER: I had to get it back. You know how much it's worth, lady?
Plenty. And I
got to get it to Keystone City. 
TROI: Why? What's at Keystone City? 
GANGSTER: That's where everything begins. Gin. 
(his five cards all show the jigsaw) 
WORF: Are you succeeding, Commander? 
DATA: I am ready to access the main power grid. 
CONDUCTOR: Keystone City, next stop. Keystone City. Well, look who's
back. 
WORF: We do not want any trouble. We are simply passengers. 
CONDUCTOR: Well then I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your
tickets? Right. Sorry, boys. You're getting off right here. 
GANGSTER: This is my stop. 
TROI: Wait. What happens at Keystone City? Why are you taking the brick
there? 
GANGSTER: Excuse me. 
TROI: I think we should follow that man. That brick may be an important
clue. 
[Holodeck - subway]

(the Gangster goes up the subway steps from the New
York City Transit System at Broadway + 7th) 
TROI: Where did he go? 
(they walk down the empty street to a manhole cover) 
DATA: I can access the power grid here. I will attempt to depolarise
the grid by using a low frequency inversion field. It may disengage the
nodes without destroying them. 
TROI: There he is. I'm going after him. 
(Worf goes with her, leaving Data alone. Sunshine taxi registration
H20638 hurtles round the corner and drives straight at him. Data rolls
out of the way and carries on his work)

[Holodeck - wall]

(the Gangster comes to a building with scaffolding,
and a wall where there is one brick missing from the middle) 
TROI: What are you doing here? 
GANGSTER: Laying the foundation. 
(he puts his brick into the gap, it glows then blends in with the rest
of the wall) 
GANGSTER: Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a train to catch.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I don't understand it, Captain. All of a
sudden, cargo bay five started to depressurise. 
PICARD: Did everyone get out in time? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and I've re-established the containment field, but
I'm reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of
transporter activity. Something weird is happening there, Captain. 
PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find out
what's going on. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Cargo bay]

(in the middle of the floor, a 3d version of the
jigsaw is growing with a light inside it) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard here. What's going on? 
LAFORGE: I wish I could tell you.
