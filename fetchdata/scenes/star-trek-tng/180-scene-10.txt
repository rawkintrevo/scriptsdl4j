RIKER ISHARA LAFORGE WORF PICARD TANTSU CRUSHER DATA

[Transporter room]

DATA: Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara. I am
Commander Data. 
ISHARA: You're not human. 
DATA: I am an android. 
ISHARA: Built for fighting? 
DATA: On what do you base that assumption? 
ISHARA: A cybernetic device serving on a starship. 
DATA: The Enterprise is not a ship of war. It is a ship of exploration.

ISHARA: The first thing to do is help you map the colony. This is a
general grid of the tunnel system. I can fill in the specific details
from memory. 
DATA: My orders are to escort you to the Observation Lounge. Please
come with me.

[Corridor]

DATA: Your sister never spoke of you. 
ISHARA: That's not surprising. 
DATA: It is surprising to me. Tasha and I spent much time together. We
had a considerable number of conversations. 
ISHARA: Did she talk at all about the colony? 
DATA: Only to say that she was lucky to have escaped. 
ISHARA: It wasn't luck. It was cowardice. 
DATA: Cowardice is a term that I have never heard applied to Tasha. 
ISHARA: Is something wrong? 
DATA: No. It is just that for a moment, the expression on your face
reminded me of her. 
ISHARA: It's been fifteen years. I don't even remember what she looked
like.

(Data and Ishara enter) 
ISHARA: You don't believe I'm Tasha's sister. 
PICARD: We have considered the possibility. 
ISHARA: I'm not surprised. You can sample my DNA if you like. 
CRUSHER: Yes, I will. 
PICARD: Please, sit down. 
(Riker offers her his seat) 
ISHARA: Thank you. 
PICARD: Perhaps it would help if you gave us some idea of what we're
dealing with on Turkana Four. The last information describes a colony
in almost complete disarray. 
ISHARA: It started falling apart almost thirty years ago. There were
dozens of factions. They fought until the city above ground was in
ruins. 
RIKER: The Coalition and the Alliance are all that's left? 
ISHARA: We were the two strongest factions. When the government
couldn't stop the violence, they gave us police powers. The proximity
detectors were originally designed by the government to keep us under
control. 
PICARD: Apparently, that part of the plan didn't work very well. 
ISHARA: No. After a few months, we didn't need the government any more.

LAFORGE: Tasha left you in the middle of all that? 
ISHARA: She didn't abandon me, if that's what you mean. Tasha asked me
to go with her, but I had already joined the Coalition. They were my
family. Captain, we don't have a lot of time. Maybe we should get
started. 
WORF [OC]: Incoming transmission from the colony, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. 
TAN TSU [on monitor]: Enterprise, I'm being held by Turkana Four
Alliance. I've been instructed to say that you have twenty hours to
make reparations for Federation intrusion into this colony, or my pilot
and I will be killed. 
CRUSHER: Ask them if we can at least send some medical 
(transmission ends) 
ISHARA: Take that threat seriously, Captain. They'll torture them and
then they'll kill them. My cadre has never recovered a hostage alive
from the Alliance. Your crewmen could be held in any number of places.
The Alliance has two main headquarters and thirteen ancillary bases of
operation. All underground, all heavily guarded. 
LAFORGE: Captain, if I could get to the myographic scanner. 
ISHARA: What's that? 
DATA: A sensing device from the escape pod. It monitors the bioelectric
signatures of the crew, in the event they get separated from the pod. 
LAFORGE: I could install a booster on the device that would relay its
signals to the Enterprise. Then we could track the men from up here. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, we don't know where the escape pod is. 
ISHARA: Level three C, section five four seven. We have our sources.
