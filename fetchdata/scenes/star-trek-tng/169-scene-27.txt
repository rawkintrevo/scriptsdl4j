TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER HOLOTROI CRUSHER BARCLAY

[Bridge]

PICARD: Yes, I should say you should, Commander.
Your holodeck activities can wait until later. And Commander. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, sir? 
PICARD: It would be wise to consult Lieutenant Barclay 
[Holodeck - Glade]

PICARD [OC]: On this latest incident. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to very much, Captain. La Forge out. We need to find
Barclay now. 
HOLO-TROI: Cast aside your masks and let me slip into your minds. 
TROI: Muzzle it. 
(they walk on and find Reg sleeping in the lap of Gainsborough Beverly)

CRUSHER: Shh!

[Corridor]

TROI: We have a lot to talk about, Mister Barclay. 
LAFORGE: Commander, Barclay and I had better get to Engineering. 
RIKER: Dismissed. 
(further along) 
BARCLAY: I just couldn't keep my eyes open. I'd worked twelve hours on
the power systems and then, then the transporter went down. 
LAFORGE: Reg, you had a chance to get some help from the real
Counsellor Troi but instead you went back in there. 
BARCLAY: I know. I didn't want to. I just couldn't help myself. 
LAFORGE: You're going to be able to write the book on holodiction.
Look, I know how easy it is to get caught up in it. I fell in love in
there once. 
BARCLAY: Really? 
LAFORGE: But I knew when it was time to turn it off and say goodbye. It
wasn't easy, but I did it. 
BARCLAY: You know, the people I create in there are more real to me
than anyone I meet out here, except maybe you, Commander. 
LAFORGE: I need you out here, Reg. Now more than ever.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The injectors aren't responding to the
diagnostic commands. 
BARCLAY: I think we should drop out of warp. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge.
