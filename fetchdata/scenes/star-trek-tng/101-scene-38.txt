onto her signal. 
[Passageway]

(Data and Riker beam into the passageway) 
RIKER: I'm sorry. Close your mind to the pain. 
TROI: Unhappiness. Terrible despair. 
RIKER: Who? 
TROI: I don't know. No life form anything like us. 
RIKER: What in the hell kind of place is this? Geordi, what do you see?

LAFORGE: Well, it's of no material I recognise, sir, or have even heard
of.

CRUSHER: Captain. Sir, my son is not on the Bridge. He merely
accompanied me on the turbolift. 
PICARD: Your son? 
CRUSHER: His name's Wesley. You last saw him years ago when 
PICARD: Well, as long as he's here. I knew your father, Wesley. Want a
look around? 
(Wesley steps onto the Bridge) 
PICARD: But don't touch anything! Try it out. (the captain's chair) The

PICARD: Picard. Go ahead. 
SECURITY [OC]: Ship's sensors have detected the presence of a vessel
approaching this planet. No ship is scheduled to arrive at this time,
sir. 
PICARD: Have Commander Riker and his team beam back up. Security, could
that be the Hood returning here? 
SECURITY [OC]: The vessel does not match the Hood's configuration or ID
signal. 
PICARD: Put it on main viewer. Identification? 
WORF: Vessel unknown, configuration unknown, sir. 
(It looks like a classic flying saucer) 
PICARD: Hail it. 
WORF: We've been trying, sir. No response. 
PICARD: Raise all shields, phasers at ready. 
WORF: Shields up, sir. Phasers ready. 
PICARD: Get me Groppler Zorn. And continue universal greetings on all
frequencies.

PICARD [OC]: Do you know who it is? 
ZORN: There are no ships scheduled to arrive until

PICARD: I asked if you knew who it is. You
mentioned the Ferengi Alliance to me.

ZORN: But we have had no dealings with them. It was
only a, a thought.
