[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Ferengi vessel is moving out of
orbit. Impulse power They are approaching the entry to the wormhole,
sir. 
PICARD: Computer, is the Ferengi Goss still on board the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: DaiMon Goss departed the Enterprise at fourteen hundred
hours. 
WORF: They are powering forward missile launchers, sir. 
PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Ferengi. 
PICARD: Request an explanation of your actions, DaiMon Goss. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: I've learned from informed sources that the
Federation has manipulated these negotiations from the very beginning,
and has already signed a secret agreement with the Barzans. 
PICARD: That is not true. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: The Ferengi offer was never seriously considered.

PICARD: Premier Bhavani welcomed you to these proceedings, despite my
better judgment. 
GOSS: [on viewscreen] We will be ignored no longer. 
WORF: They've fired a missile directly at the opening, sir. 
PICARD: Destroy it. 
WORF: On screen. Firing phasers.

[Observation lounge]

BHAVANI: Your offers both have merit, gentlemen. if
I could find a deciding factor 
(Red alert sounds) 
RIKER: Riker to Picard. What's happening, Captain? 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Goss has fired a missile at the wormhole. 
[Observation lounge]

PICARD [OC]: I need you on the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Excuse me. 
(Riker leaves) 
RAL: Excuse me for saying so under the circumstances, Premier, but this
fight is really between the Federation and the Ferengi. Now it seems
unconscionable that your wormhole is being used as a pawn in their
power struggle.

[Bridge]

PICARD: You must know we will not allow you to do
this. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: If the Ferengi cannot have the wormhole, no one
will. 
PICARD: A missile will have no destructive effect on a wormhole, but if
it should explode near the shuttlecraft they will be destroyed. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: Casualties of war, Commander. My men are prepared
to die. Are yours? 
TROI: Captain, he's lying. I'm almost sure of it. He doesn't mean what
he says. 
RIKER: Why? What is he doing it for then? 
BHAVANI: Permission to enter the Bridge, Captain.
PICARD: Premier, with all due respect 
RAL: Captain, I believe I am in a better position to settle this with
DaiMon Goss than you are. May I address him? 
PICARD: Premier. 
RAL: DaiMon Goss, this is Devinoni Ral. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: I have nothing to say to you, Ral. 
RAL: Well then, just listen. The planet Barzan has reached an agreement
with the Chrysalians for long term control of the wormhole. Now on
behalf of the Chrysalians, I am prepared to offer the Ferengi free
access to the wormhole in perpetuity. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: I have your word on this? 
RAL: Yes, my word, sir, in exchange for Ferengi convoy privileges to be
negotiated in good faith. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: This is an acceptable offer. 
WORF: Ferengi vessel has shut down its forward missile launcher. 
PICARD: Stand down red alert. 
BHAVANI: Commander Riker. I'm sorry you had to learn about my decision
this way. You represented the Federation well, but I have come to
believe that the Chrysalians' tradition of peace is more desirable to
my planet. 
TROI: Excuse me, Premier. There's something you should know. I'm sorry,
was there something you wanted to say? 
RAL: No, not at all. 
TROI: I sensed you suddenly felt uncomfortable. 
RAL: Well, after all, it was a very tense situation. 
TROI: But that's what's so odd. It wasn't tense at all. In fact, I
sensed no tension from you or Goss. 
GOSS [on viewscreen]: But I was tense! I was ready to blow it up! I
strongly protest!
PICARD: Screen off. 
TROI: It was as though you were performing a scene for all of us. 
RAL: Pardon me, Captain, I believe there's a slight conflict of
interest here. 
TROI: I agree, entirely. Mister Ral asked me not to tell anyone he has
empathic powers which he uses to manipulate his competitors in a
negotiation. And yes, it did put me in a conflict of interest, which I
hope I have now resolved. Premier, I believe Ral has used your fear of
continuing aggression between the Federation and its enemies to
undermine our position. I also believe that this incident was staged by
Ral and Goss to provide you a reason to choose in favour of the
Chrysalians. 
WESLEY: Captain, it's the shuttlecraft. They're coming back through. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Shuttle nine to Enterprise. 
PICARD: On screen. 
LAFORGE [OC]: This is shuttle nine reporting in. 
[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: Barely. 
PICARD [OC]: And the Ferengi pod, Commander? 
LAFORGE: Trapped on the other side, sir. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: In the Delta Quadrant. We tried to warn
them. They wouldn't follow us. 
PICARD: Elaborate. 
[Shuttlepod]

DATA: Captain, this end of the wormhole is
currently stable, but the other end apparently shifts positions
periodically. 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: The Barzan probe had no way to recognise
this. Eventually, both sides will be unstable. 
LAFORGE [OC]: It's a dry well, Captain. Worthless.
PICARD: Acknowledged, Shuttle. Main shuttlebay, prepare for final
approach. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Captain, DaiMon Goss is demanding to know where his men are. 
PICARD: Advise him to set his coordinates for the Delta Quadrant. He
may run into them in eighty years or so. 
RIKER: Mister Ral, congratulations on winning the rights to the Barzan
wormhole. 
RAL: I take the risks, Mister Riker, and I stand by my agreements.
