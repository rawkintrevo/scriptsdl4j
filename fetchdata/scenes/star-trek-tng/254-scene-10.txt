(clouds drift just below the edge of the drop) 
PICARD: Anna! Anna! 
GUEST2: Captain, this ridge extends for a kilometre in either direction.

PICARD: We can search it twice as fast if we separate. 
(so they head off in opposite directions) 
PICARD: Anna! Anna! 
(Picard sees Anna standing by the edge in the other direction) 
PICARD: Anna, Anna. 
GUEST3: Stay away from me. 
PICARD: You don't have to do this. I found Voval, the shuttle pilot,
he's still alive. He can help us get away from here. 
GUEST3: I don't care. I'll jump unless you promise to love me. 
PICARD: No. No, I won't promise. You have been manipulating me, haven't
you? 
GUEST3: Jean-Luc, what are you saying? 
PICARD: The necklace. It broke. I saw it in the cargo freighter, on the
floor by the fire. I left it there. Now it's around your neck. It's
whole. How? 
GUEST3: Tell me you love me. I must know. 
PICARD: Where's Voval? Isn't it convenient that he arrived moments
after you left? That he insisted that I come here to look for you? That
I find you, here on the ledge, ready to jump? That's very good timing,
don't you think? 
GUEST3: Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: Are you and Voval working together? He's the only one who could
have brought you the necklace. 
GUEST3: Tell me about your love or I'll jump! 
PICARD: Go ahead. Why don't you do it? It's a long way down. Must be
two hundred metres. You'd die instantly, if that's what you want. But I
don't think that it really is. 
(Anna touches her pendent and turns into Voval) 
GUEST2: I have failed. 
PICARD: Failed? Voval, what is going on? 
GUEST2: My name is Ambassador Voval. 
PICARD: Ambassador? 
GUEST2: My mission was to study human intimacy, specifically the concept
you call love. In our study of your culture, we did not understand
certain concepts. So we sent three representatives to study them, to
experience them. 
PICARD: But why did you believe that bringing me here would give you a
better understanding of love? 
GUEST2: Several years ago, we discovered the remains of the Terellian
freighter on this planet. The ship contained logs made by a single
survivor, a human woman. That was our first contact with human culture.
The woman lived alone here for seven years until another human crashed
on this planet. A human male. 
PICARD: And the man was injured and she nursed him back to health, and
they fell in love. 
GUEST2: In the logs, she described many concepts we found difficult to
understand. Pleasure, antagonism, love. These were alien to us. We
wished to experience them for ourselves. Ambassador Loquel was sent to
experience pleasure. Byleth was sent to experience antagonism. And I
was sent to experience love. Was this wrong? 
PICARD: Let me just say that we would not take such a direct approach.
Ambassador, I have tell you that in my culture, what you have done
would be considered a crime. 
GUEST2: Crime? 
PICARD: Well, we'll can talk about it later. For now, I think we should
get off this planet. Am I in assuming the damage the shuttle is not as
bad as it seems? 
GUEST2: That is correct. We can leave at any time. 
PICARD: I think that now would be quite nice.
