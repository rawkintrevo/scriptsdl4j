RIKER WORF PICARD TAMARIAN DATA DATHON

[Bridge]

DATA: Sensors show Captain Picard and the Tamarian
in apparent good health, approximately twenty metres from each other. 
RIKER: Hail the Tamarian ship. 
WORF: On screen. 
RIKER: You are holding our captain. I want him released. 
TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Darmok at Tanagra. 
RIKER: Your action could be interpreted as an act of war. 
TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Kiteo. His eyes closed. Chenza at court. The
court of silence. Chenza! 
RIKER: Is there any way to get through to them? 
DATA: Not without further study. 
RIKER: Close the channel, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Gladly, sir. 
RIKER: Worf, I want you to assemble a security team, take a shuttle
down to the planet, bring back the captain. 
WORF: Aye, Commander. 
DATA: Sir, the Tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle. 
RIKER: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam and
firing on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm betting
they're not going to push it that far.

[Planet surface]

(it is night. Dathon has lit a cozy fire while
Picard is only just getting his started when it goes out) 
DATHON: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
PICARD: Shaka indeed. What now, Captain? Will you attack me in my
sleep? If I don't freeze to death first. 
DATHON: Darmok of Kanza. Jalad of the Kituay. 
PICARD: Picard of the Federation. Of the starship Enterprise. Of the
planet Earth. 
DATHON: Kadir beneath Mo Moteh. 
(he casts some runes to make his mind up then lies down to sleep with
his dagger. But Picard is pacing. Dathon gets up and throws a flaming
brand towards him) 
DATHON: Temba. 
PICARD: Temba? What does that mean? Fire? Does Temba mean fire? 
DATHON: Temba. His arms wide. 
PICARD: Temba is a person? His arms wide. Because he's holding them
apart in, in generosity. In giving. In taking. 
DATHON: Temba. His arms wide. 
(Picard accepts the gift of fire, and Dathon smiles) 
PICARD: Thank you. Thank you.

First Officer's log, supplemental. I am sending a
shuttlecraft to find Captain Picard, gambling that the Tamarians will
sit tight rather than risk an exchange of phaser fire.
