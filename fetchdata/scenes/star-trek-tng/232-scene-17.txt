Q: Well, if it isn't Number Two. 
RIKER: I was looking for Doctor Crusher. I didn't know what nutrients
she wanted to send with the bacilli. 
AMANDA: I'm not sure. I'll tell her to contact you. 
RIKER: Thanks. 
AMANDA: You could stay here and wait for her, if you, you know, wanted
to. 
RIKER: Just tell her I'll be in shuttlebay two. 
(Riker leaves with a big grin) 
Q: You're attracted to him. 
AMANDA: I am not. 
Q: I think you are. How repulsive. How do you stand that hair all over
his face? 
(Beverly enters) 
AMANDA: Doctor, Commander Riker was just here looking for you. He said
he'd be in Shuttlebay Two. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. Have you finished already? 
AMANDA: Yes. 
CRUSHER: How did you do it so quickly? 
AMANDA: Q helped me. It took us about half the time that it would have
normally taken us. 
CRUSHER: That explains this data. I needed to know the rates of
mitosis. By artificially inflating them you made the experiment
useless. Now I have to do it all over again. 
AMANDA: I'm sorry, Doctor. 
Q: Don't be sorry. If she wants to make things difficult on herself,
that's her business. 
CRUSHER: Why did you interfere with what she was doing? 
Q: She's a Q. Making her plod through human chores is beneath her. 
CRUSHER: She has asked not to be treated differently. 
Q: That doesn't mean she should be bored to death. 
CRUSHER: I don't interfere with what you're teaching her. 
Q: You wouldn't be capable of interfering. 
CRUSHER: I don't think it's too much to ask for you to do the same. 
(Beverly is suddenly turned into a red setter dog. Amanda restores her
to human)
CRUSHER: And you stay out of mine. 
Q: Well, when you put it like that, I think you're absolutely right.

DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Data? 
DATA: I have further information regarding the tornado that killed
Amanda Rogers' parents. 
PICARD: What is it? 
DATA: It was unusually compact, yet extremely powerful. Its recorded
wind velocity was characteristic of a funnel three times its size. 
PICARD: Download the files to my Ready room. I'll study them there. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
