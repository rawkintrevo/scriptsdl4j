oh gender variety forgive hair involved baby vanished confusing

[Shuttlecraft]

SOREN: I've illuminated the delta four grid map.
We'll start there and expand. 
RIKER: Stand by, forward phaser array. 
SOREN: Pulse vanished at delta four point two by point three. 
RIKER: Firing second burst. 
SOREN: Delta four point four by point five. 
RIKER: This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. 
SOREN: Commander, tell me about your sexual organs. 
RIKER: Er. 
SOREN: Is that an uncomfortable subject for humans? 
RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. 
SOREN: I'm interested in your mating practices. What is involved with
two sexes? 
RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. 
SOREN: Mating? 
RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Women
carry the baby. 
SOREN: Our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks, which the parents
inseminate. From what we know of other species, our method is less
risky and less painful. 
RIKER: And less enjoyable. 
SOREN: Less enjoyable? 
RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It
can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. 
SOREN: That's just the last step. Mating is a long ritual for us, full
of variety and invention. I assure you, it is extremely pleasurable. 
RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. 
SOREN: That may be coming from our shuttle. I'll note these
coordinates. 
SOREN: I wonder. 
RIKER: What? 
SOREN: If a human and a J'naii would be sexually compatible. 
RIKER: I don't know. 
SOREN: Of course it would never be permitted. 
RIKER: Why not? 
SOREN: The idea of gender. It is offensive to my people. You see, long
ago we had two sexes, as you do. But we evolved into a higher form. I
don't mean to sound insulting, but on my planet we have been taught
that gender is primitive. 
RIKER: Primitive? 
SOREN: Less evolved. 
RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for an
experience that's primitive. 
SOREN: Delta five grid map is fully plotted. 
RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. 
(the shuttle's port nacelle workings are exposed) 
RIKER: The port engine's down. 
SOREN: Reducing power in the starboard nacelle. 
RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters.

SOREN: Thrusters aren't responding. I'll try to reroute the firing
sequence. 
RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! 
(Soren gets thrown across the floor) 
LAFORGE [OC]: Enterprise to shuttle, do you read me? 
RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We'll try to get a tractor beam on you. 
RIKER: The sooner the better. Enterprise, we have an injury. Transport
Soren directly to Sickbay. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Right away, Commander.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: It's just a mild concussion. You're going
to be fine. This will reduce the inflammation. 
SOREN: Doctor, you are female. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
SOREN: Forgive me, I do not mean to be rude, but I'm curious. What is
it like? 
CRUSHER: Well, it's just the way I am. I've never really thought about
what it's like. 
SOREN: I've noticed you tend to have longer hair, and you arrange it
more elaborately. And you apply colour to your bodies. 
CRUSHER: Colour? 
SOREN: You put colour on your mouths, and your eyes, your cheeks, your
fingernails. The men don't. 
CRUSHER: That's true. 
SOREN: Then it is up to women to attract the men. 
CRUSHER: Oh, no. Men want to be attractive too, believe me. They just
go about it differently. 
SOREN: No colour. 
CRUSHER: No colour. They like to pretend they're not doing anything to
attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their
minds. 
SOREN: This is very confusing. Then, are women considered more
superior, or are men? 
CRUSHER: Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and
inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time. 
(Riker enters) 
CRUSHER: Will, your co-pilot is going to be fine. The injury was minor.

RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. 
SOREN: I'm afraid you're not rid of me yet, Commander. I will be able
to complete the mission. 
RIKER: Glad you feel better. 
SOREN: What happened? What made the shuttle go into a spin? 
RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from
the null pocket and shut it down. 
SOREN: Are we still on schedule, then? 
RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. 
SOREN: I'm fine. We should go check the port engine. 
RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. 
SOREN: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I don't see any problem. But if you feel any symptoms,
headache, dizziness, come back. 
SOREN: You have my word.
