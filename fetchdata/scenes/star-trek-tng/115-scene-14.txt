PICARD: How contagious is it? 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Still running tests. The key is to figure
out how the virus is transmitted. So far I've been able to rule out 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: Person to person contact. 
PICARD: Well, keep with it, Doctor. Starfleet has very important
business for us as soon as the away team returns. I don't fancy the
idea of my crew being infected. 
[Great Hall]

RIKER: Data, what's the best way to go about
finding Ramsey and the other survivors? 
DATA: If we can isolate something unique to the Odin survivors, perhaps
an element not otherwise found on Angel One, we can utilise the
Enterprise scanners. 
RIKER: Mister Data will need access to your library. 
BEATA: Our library is far too sophisticated for a man to comprehend. 
DATA: I am an android, Mistress, although anatomically I am a male. 
BEATA: An amusing notion. Maybe you could teach our males a thing or
two. Trent, see to the android's needs.

WORF: Bridge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: [OC]: Go ahead, Lieutenant. 
WORF: The away team requests that we scan the planet surface for traces
of platinum. 
PICARD: [OC]: Have Mister La Forge break fixed orbit and initiate a
search pattern. 
WORF: Aye, Captain. Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Search pattern initiated now.
