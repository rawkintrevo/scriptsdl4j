PICARD SHIPLEY DATA LAFORGE DATA [OC]
augment starts expanded alien band levels fail integrity present

[Engineering]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, report. 
LAFORGE: I still can't locate the homing signal. We've covered the
entire upper subspace energy band. We're extending the scan to adjacent
levels. 
PICARD: Mister Data, your status? 
DATA [OC]: The rupture has expanded another four point two percent. 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: Without further reinforcement, containment
field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes.

[Engineering]

PICARD: Can you divert more power to the
containment field? 
LAFORGE: I can try to augment the field with auxiliary power, but it
won't be much. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Alien lab]

(An alien returns to Riker and scans him then
shuffles off again. The emitter starts beeping)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Captain, I've located the homing signal.
Locking onto it now. It's coming from a subspace energy level of
sixteen point two keV. 
PICARD: Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. 
SHIPLEY: Graviton emitters at full power, sir. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, how much time? 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: At the present rate, containment failure will
occur in approximately nine minutes.
