[Hotel room]

PICARD [OC]: Why can't you get out?

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge has a thought. He believes we can phaser a
slice in the field 
[Hotel room]

PICARD [OC]: Surrounding the structure. 
RIKER: That means the atmosphere of the planet would instantly rush in.

DATA: Our projected survival would be approximately twelve seconds. 
[Observation lounge]

PULASKI: Correct. The cryogenic process would be
nearly instantaneous. 
RIKER [OC]: But I assume you could revive us? 
PULASKI: Yes. 
[Hotel room]

PULASKI [OC]: In theory. 
PICARD [OC]: You must understand, Number One 
[Observation lounge]

PICARD: We'll wait here for months if necessary.
We're just considering options. 
RIKER [OC]: If you're trying to motivate us to find 
[Hotel room]

RIKER: Our own way out of here, you've succeeded,
Captain. 
(The telephone rings, and Worf answers it) 
WORF: Yes? There is a female voice asking if we want room service. 
DATA: I believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned. 
RIKER: Tell her no. 
WORF: No. 
RIKER: What did she say? 
WORF: She said the kitchen will be open twenty four hours if we change
our minds. 
RIKER: We're going to explore the rest of the hotel. We'll keep a comm.
line open. You two go down to the lobby and see if there's anything
that we've missed. You talk to the guests and try to find out who or
what they are. I'll check out the rest of the floors. 

[Ready room]

PICARD: Computer, locate and display the text of
the novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. 
COMPUTER: Accessing. 
PICARD: If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may find
the solution within its pages. Ah. (reading)
'It was a dark and
stormy night'. It's not a promising beginning. 
TROI: It may get better.

DATA: I suggest we separate and blend in with these
beings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. 
(Data heads to the table with Texas and Vanessa) 
VANESSA: I need a four. Give me a four. 
TEXAS: Oh, shoot. 
VANESSA: How much do I have left here? 
TEXAS: Honey, now you know it's bad luck to count your chips at the
table. 
VANESSA: Yeah? 
DATA: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire, where are you from? 
TEXAS: Lubbock, Texas. 
DATA: And how did you get here? 
TEXAS: To Vegas? Drove my car. I got a ninety one Caddy with only
eighty thousand miles on it. 
DATA: Where is your automobile now? 
TEXAS: Out front, I suppose. What the hell difference does it make? 
DATA: Could you take me there? 
VANESSA: Hit me. I'm losing my shirt. 
TEXAS: Son, why would I want to do that? Can't you see I'm trying to to
help this little lady? 
DATA: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. 
TEXAS: Sure does seem that way when you're losing, don't it? We're just
trying to turn this lady's wagon around, and win back some lost change.
Otherwise she's in a desperate situation and she's got nowhere to turn.
Well, almost nowhere. 
VANESSA: I stay, right? (holding thirteen) 
TEXAS: I wouldn't. 
DATA: The odds favour standing pat. 
VANESSA: What do I do? 
TEXAS: Do you want a card or what? 
VANESSA: Hit me. (a Jack) Too many. I've almost lost it all. What am I
going to do? 
TEXAS: There, there, there, there, there.
