[Classroom]

(the male teacher is reading aloud to the quiet and
attentive pupils, who are following on their PADDS, except one) 
GUEST1: Dara and her brother found themselves in the land of Tagas
where the ruler, Elamos the Magnificent, had proclaimed as law. 'No
children will be tolerated within the Great Kingdom'. When Dara saw the
proclamation, she just laughed, and said, 'How magnificent a ruler, to
be frightened by the likes of us.' Timothy, we're done with sculpture
for now. 
TIMOTHY: It's not finished. 
(putting a portico on a model building) 
GUEST1: We'll come back to it next period. Why don't you pick up your
mythology book and follow along? 
TIMOTHY: But it's not finished. 
(the worried teacher casts a glance towards Troi watching through the
window)

[Bridge]

(at the science station) 
LAFORGE: Magnetic residual analysis confirms that the Vico was attacked
inside the Black Cluster. The graviton wave fronts pushed the ship to
where we found it. 
PICARD: No signs of phaser burns on the hull. 
LAFORGE: No, sir. Torsional stress levels point to a disrupter-style
weapon. 
DATA: Fracture points indicate that the energy burst came from a range
of less than three thousand metres. 
PICARD: But that's a strategy consistent with a cloaked vessel.
Romulan. Or Klingon. But we're quite a distance from either of their
territories. 
DATA: The Breen have outposts in this sector. The attack on the Vico is
consistent with their battle tactics and their level of technology. 
PICARD: Thank you, Data. But what would the Breen be doing inside the
Black Cluster? The boy described a boarding party with helmets and
phaser rifles. 
LAFORGE: Boarding party? I don't think that's likely, sir. 
(Troi enters) 
PICARD: Counsellor. 
LAFORGE: There was absolutely no evidence of anybody coming on board
the Vico. We would have found a transporter field trace. Or if somebody
had used the entry ports, we would have found an electrostatic
differential in the docking latches, and we didn't. Could Timothy have
imagined that, Counsellor? 
PICARD: Or could he be lying? 
TROI: If he's lying, I haven't been able to sense it. Perhaps his
emotional trauma level is too high. 
PICARD: Why wouldn't he tell us the truth? 
TROI: He's still in shock. it's hard to know what's going on in his
mind right now. 
LAFORGE: Well, I'll go back and check the sensor readings again but I
don't think we're going to find anything. 
PICARD: Thank you, Geordi. 
(La Forge leaves) 
TROI: Data. Captain, I think we should ask Data to spend some time with
him. 
DATA: I do not understand. 
TROI: I'm very worried about his behaviour and what I've just heard
doesn't make me feel any better. Data, you're the only
one he's reached out to, because you rescued him. We can use your
relationship with him to help his recovery. 
PICARD: Would Timothy also be more inclined to tell Data the truth
about what happened? 
TROI: It's a possibility. 
PICARD: Commander, proceed with Timothy as the Counsellor suggests. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Picard leaves) 
DATA: Counsellor, exactly how shall I proceed? 
TROI: Just be with him. You're a presence he trusts, and that's what he
needs most right now.
