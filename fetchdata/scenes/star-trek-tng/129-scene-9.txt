[Warehouse]

LAFORGE: Data, wait! Data! 
MORIARTY: Why does it frighten you, Holmes?

[Street]

LAFORGE: Data. Data, will you please tell me what's
going on? 
DATA: Computer, exit! 
[Corridor]

DATA: Computer, execute complete shutdown of the
Holodeck. 
COMPUTER: Access denied. 
DATA: Explain. 
COMPUTER: Override protocol has been initiated. 
[Street]

LAFORGE: It's still running. The programme didn't
shut down. 
DATA: We must see the Captain. 
[Corridor]

LAFORGE: Data, wait. What is it? What's on that
paper? And why can't we shut down the holodeck? Data. 
DATA: This. 
LAFORGE: This is impossible. How can a character from 1890's London
draw a picture of the Enterprise? Who's got control of the computer? 
DATA: He does. Moriarty. 
LAFORGE: That is impossible? I don't understand. 
DATA: Nor do I. 
LAFORGE: Data, wait. What about the doctor? Is she all right in there? 
DATA: No. She is in grave danger.

[Observation Lounge]

PICARD: Computer, why wasn't the holodeck programme
terminated? 
COMPUTER: The override protocol has been initiated. 
PICARD: On whose authority? 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Geordi La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Me? 
PICARD: All right, tell me from the beginning exactly what happened. 
LAFORGE: Well, Doctor Pulaski and I had a discussion about whether Data
could solve an original Holmes-type mystery. 
PICARD: Which you asked the computer to provide. 
LAFORGE: Yes, with a worthy opponent. 
PICARD: Worthy of Holmes? 
(watch the penny drop) 
LAFORGE: Oh, my God. I asked for a Holmes-type mystery with an opponent
capable of defeating Data. That got to be it. 
PICARD: Merde. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. 
PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. 
DATA: Captain, this character, Moriarty, he called for the arch. 
PICARD: So, he has access to the computer. 
DATA: And perhaps our library files as well, sir. That level of
information would be necessary in order to create a true adversary for
me. 
PICARD: Theorise, Data. What are his limits? 
DATA: He is still a fictional character, sir, originally programmed
with nineteenth century knowledge. 
RIKER: Which now has access to twenty fourth century knowledge. 
PICARD: What does he need to begin making use of that? 
DATA: Only time, sir. 
WORF: Sir, I can lead a security team to sweep the holodeck, find the
Doctor, and bring her out. 
DATA: Captain, I believe that would place the Doctor at risk. It is
probable our mortality failsafe has been overridden. 
PICARD: Computer, where is Doctor Pulaski. 
COMPUTER: Doctor Pulaski is on holodeck two. 
PICARD: And her vital signs? 
COMPUTER: Strong and stable. 
RIKER: Captain, recommend we try to destroy the hologram generations
themselves. Is that possible, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Using wave guides, I could split a particle stream out of the
matter/antimatter chamber and route it down through existing conduit
into the holodeck. If accelerated to sufficient velocity that would
quite literally wash away all present holographic constructs. The
London buildings, the streets, the people, all gone including Moriarty.

PICARD: Doctor Pulaski? 
RIKER: The particle beam will tear apart human flesh as well. 
TROI: Captain, I'm sensing something from the holodeck. It's as if a
unifying force or a single consciousness is trying to bring it all into
focus. 
DATA: There can be only one explanation. In programming Moriarty to
defeat me, not Holmes, he had to be able to acquire something which I
possess. 
PICARD: Exactly what? 
DATA: Consciousness, sir. Without it he could not defeat me. 
(The ship jerks suddenly from side to side) 
PICARD: Computer, what happened? 
COMPUTER: Attitude and stabilisation control of the Enterprise was
momentarily transferred to holodeck two. 
PICARD: Data, I think it best that you and I should return to the
holodeck. 
DATA: I will change into my uniform, sir. 
PICARD: No. I will change into some appropriate costume. Uniforms might
pose questions I'd rather he didn't ask. It seems that he feeds on
knowledge. Well, let's not give your nemesis any more information than
we have to.
