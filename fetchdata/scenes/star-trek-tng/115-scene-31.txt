Mister Ramsey and his men are dangerous.

PICARD: Status report. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir. Doctor
Crusher's converted the holodeck into an isolation ward. 
PICARD: And the away team? 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Well, no recent contact, sir, but I have
informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing Romulan
threat to our Neutral Zone outpost.

PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge until
Commander Riker returns.

WORF: Engineering reports a computer malf (sneeze)
I'm sorry, I'm getting sick.

Lieutenant. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to bridge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: The computer won't accept the variant climate controls. 
LAFORGE: On my way. 
WORF: With all respect, Lieutenant, there are people to do that job
now. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Engineering. Lieutenant Wong knows the system. I'm
sure she'll be able to resolve all problems. Worf, thanks for the
advice.
