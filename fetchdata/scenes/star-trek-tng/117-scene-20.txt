PICARD DATA LAFORGE BENSEN

[Hydraulics room]

DATA: Not possible. 
[Control room]

LAFORGE: Then what are you suggesting? 
[Hydraulics room]

DATA: Uncertain. Geordi, please return power to the
control console in this room. I wish to reactivate the
programme. 
[Control room]

LAFORGE: You got it. 
[Hydraulics room]

(The laser powers up, turns, and fires a shot into
a tunnel cut in the wall. Then it does the same in the opposite wall) 
DATA: I am running the base drilling programme. 
(The little red light focuses on the back of Data's neck and the doors
slam shut. Data turns and dodges the deadly beams)

[Control room]

DATA [OC]: Geordi, servos off. 
BENSEN: They are off. 
LAFORGE: Data, what's happening? 
DATA [OC]: Too much to explain. 
(Benson and La Forge run to the Hydraulics room door) 
LAFORGE: Can you open that? La Forge to Enterprise. We have a problem. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Be specific. 
[Control room]

LAFORGE: Data's in the hydraulics room alone, and
we're hearing laser blasts. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Get him out of there! 
[Control room]

BENSEN: It's not working again. 
LAFORGE: We've got to get this door open. Data! We can't get in! Data!
Data! Data! 
(The door opens on a room full of smoke)

PICARD: Away team, now. What is happening?
