TEMAREK TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD BRULL RIKER YUTA WESLEY VOLNOTH CRUSHER DATA MAROUK

[Gatherer camp]

(It looks like a junk yard) 
LAFORGE: Artonian lasers. Tonkian homing beacons. Quite a collection. 
DATA: Noranium alloy, sir. It's salvage value is quite low. 
RIKER: Looks like these Gatherers weren't too discriminating in what
they steal. 
WORF: Commander? Ambush! 
(The Gatherers start firing at them as they hide behind barrels)
DATA: Rigelian phaser rifles, sir. Not particularly powerful. 
RIKER: Powerful enough. We came to talk! 
WORF: Your words are wasted, Commander. They understand only this. (a
phaser) 
RIKER: We're here to establish a dialogue, Worf. 
RIKER: Data, tell me about noranium. It vaporises at? 
DATA: Two thousand three hundred fourteen degrees. Of course, noranium
carbide 
RIKER: Thank you, Data.
LAFORGE: Setting seven ought to do it. 
RIKER: Three, two, one, now! 
(They fire at some of the metal junk, which creates a smoke screen.) 
RIKER: Enterprise, four to beam up. 
BRULL: Cowards! 
(He puts the fire out with a bucket of soil) 
WORF: Your ambushes would be more successful if you bathed more often. 
RIKER: We've brought the Sovereign of Acamar. 
BRULL: Marouk? Here? 
RIKER: With an offer of amnesty. 
(Later, Yuta is tasting a drink again, this time from a metal jug) 
MAROUK: Full dispensation will be extended to all Gatherers who are
willing to return to Acamar Three. 
BRULL: You don't trust me, Marouk. 
MAROUK: Should I? 
(Marouk drinks from the goblet, then Yuta takes it to Brull)
BRULL: But you expect me to trust you. Maybe you just poisoned it
yourself. Taste this, Temarek. 
(Temarek doesn't want to, so Brull pushes him down and pours some on
his face before taking a drink himself)
MAROUK: Barbarians. This is futile. 
PICARD: Sovereign. Brull! 
BRULL: Go home, old woman. 
MAROUK: You people haven't changed in a hundred years. 
BRULL: You should know. You were there. 
PICARD: Sit down! Please. Please. Now, we're here to talk. 
MAROUK: It's a waste of time, Captain. They don't care about how they
live. 
BRULL: Am I supposed to believe that you care how we live? 
MAROUK: Yes. 
PICARD: Brull, she's here, isn't she? 
BRULL: Maybe you forced her to come, Picard. 
MAROUK: Nobody forces me anywhere, Brull. 
BRULL: What is there for us on Acamar Three? 
MAROUK: A life. A home. You can end your wanderings, your miserable
existence. 
BRULL: Do I look miserable to you? 
MAROUK: The clan wars are over, Brull. It is a past we're ashamed of.
It is why you had to leave. Now, it is time to come home. 
BRULL: I want to speak privately with Sovereign Marouk and Picard.
Everyone else, get out. 
(We follow the followers leaving their masters) 
RIKER: Any insights? 
TROI: Brull's ready to negotiate. He just wants privacy so that he
won't appear weak in front of the other Gatherers. 
YUTA: You are of the clan Lornak. 
VOLNOTH: (an old man) What of it? I've seen you before. 
YUTA: Yes. 
VOLNOTH: But it's impossible. 
YUTA: No. Look closer. I am Yuta of the clan Tralesta. 
(She touches his cheek and he falls backwards in agony) 
YUTA: I am the last of my line, but my clan will outlive yours. 
(Back at the camp fire) 
BRULL: Marouk's offer has value. 
PICARD: Commander. 
BRULL: But still, I don't know. 
PICARD: But you'll agree it is enough to present to your leader. 
BRULL: Chorgan is a better judge of these matters. I will take it to
him. You will hear from me in twenty days. 
PICARD: Brull, in twenty days, I hope to be very far away from here. 
MAROUK: With all due respect, Brull, I would like to make the offer to
Chorgan myself. 
PICARD: We'll gladly take you with us on the Enterprise. How many of
your men do you want to accompany you? 
BRULL: I'll come alone. If this is a trap. 
MAROUK: Oh, it isn't. 
BRULL: Mallon, you'll be in charge while I'm gone. If I'm not back in
ten days 
TEMAREK: Brull! Brull! 
(They dash to where Volnoth is lying) 
BRULL: Volnoth. 

RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Medical Emergency. 
BRULL: Volnoth was an old man. There's nothing to be done. 
RIKER: There's a chance that our doctors can do something. 
BRULL: You found him? 
TEMAREK: Yes. And there are no other members of the Lornak clan here,
so I claim his possessions. 
BRULL: Granted. 
(Temarek pulls off Volnoth's boots) 
MAROUK: Have you no respect for the dead? 
BRULL: What's there to respect about a corpse? 
(Crusher beams down. Riker pulls Temarek off) 
BRULL: Temarek, no. Calm down. 
CRUSHER: He's been dead too long. 
RIKER: How? 
CRUSHER: Cardiac arrest? 
RIKER: You don't sound convinced. 
CRUSHER: No, he died of a heart attack, all right, but I can't find the
cause. His cardiac muscle is strong and there's no sign of arterial
occlusion. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Brull, will you show Mister Crusher the
course to set to the Hromi Cluster? 
BRULL: A child? This doesn't inspire my confidence. 
(Picard gives him a withering glare. Brull goes over to the console but
clearly doesn't know what he's looking at) 
WESLEY: This is our present position. 
BRULL: Set a heading for three four three mark seven two. 
WESLEY: That's going to take us through the centre of an asteroid belt.

BRULL: What's the matter, kid? Can't you fly yourself around a couple
of rocks? 
WESLEY: Sure I can, but if we take this heading we can avoid the belt
completely, and only lose twelve point one minutes at warp seven. 
BRULL: Have it your way, kid.
