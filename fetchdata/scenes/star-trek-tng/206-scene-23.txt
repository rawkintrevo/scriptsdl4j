[Crusher's quarters]

(Worf and Beverly enter) 
CRUSHER: Wesley? Wesley? 
WESLEY [OC]: In here, Mom. 
(she looks round the door into his bedroom to see Wesley and Robin, on
the bed, playing the game. So Worf and Beverly leave) 
ROBIN: It worked. 
WESLEY: We should keep these mock-ups with us. We can't trust anyone
anymore. Not even the Captain. 
ROBIN: I'm supposed to be on duty in Engineering. I've got to get back
before Commander La Forge suspects something. 
WESLEY: Okay. When you get there, start accessing the codes for the
security tracking system. There's something I want to try. 
ROBIN: Wesley, don't forget Law Ninety One. Always watch your back. 
WESLEY: You too.

[Bridge]

WORF: The vessel is approaching, Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, all senior officers report to the Bridge. On screen. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Report. 
PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await your
further instructions. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander
Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you
will rendezvous with the starship Endeavour. Proceed with distributing
the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a
shuttle to Starbase sixty seven. Distribute the device to all starships
currently docked there. 
PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet
Academy. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Excellent. See to it. The Ktarians commend your
efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will
be rewarded.

[Turbolift]

(Alyssa is in the lift, playing the game) 
WESLEY: Deck thirty six. 
ALYSSA: Wesley, at what level are you? 
WESLEY: I'm only level ten. 
ALYSSA: I'm at level forty seven. 
WESLEY: That's great. 
ALYSSA: You know what the secret is, don't you? Don't force it. If you
just let the game happen, it almost plays itself. 
WESLEY: I'll try that.
