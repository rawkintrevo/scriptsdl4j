entire stranger ahead la excuse need yes ordinary scans

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Excuse us, Counsellor. Captain, I finished
examining Data. 
PICARD: And? 
LAFORGE: Nothing's wrong with the technology, that I can see. He's in
perfect condition. 
PICARD: I was almost hoping that you'd find a problem. 
LAFORGE: He still could be malfunctioning beyond my ability to detect
it. 
PICARD: This entire mystery started when our sensors detected that
planet. First it was class-M, now it isn't. 
RIKER: But our sensors were malfunctioning. Our probe clearly
established the planet could not support life. 
PICARD: Data launched that probe. 
RIKER: If he rigged it, could you prove it? 
LAFORGE: I could try. 
PICARD: What happened to us in that missing day? Surely there must be
some clues. Each of us should try and think what we were doing just
before we blacked out. Reenact it if you have to. 
(Troi gasps and grabs the rail) 
WORF: Counsellor? 
PICARD: Deanna, are you all right? 
TROI: Just a moment. Yes. Yes, I'm fine. 
RIKER: What happened? 
TROI: I suddenly became dizzy. I'd think I'd better go to my quarters. 
PICARD: Perhaps Sickbay would be a better idea. 
TROI: No. No, really, I'm all right. 
PICARD: Will you see the Counsellor to her quarters? 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

TROI: Thank you for coming with me, Mister Worf. 
WORF: You are certain you are well? 
TROI: I just need some rest. Thanks. 
(she goes inside her quarters. Worf is walking away when he hears a
scream) 
WORF: Deanna! Security! Override the lock on Counsellor Troi's
quarters! Now!

[Troi's quarters]

WORF: What's wrong? 
TROI: The mirror. I came in here. I looked into the mirror. It wasn't
me, Worf! It wasn't me! It was my face, but it wasn't me inside. 
(a little later) 
PICARD: Is she all right? 
TROI: I feel fine, now. 
CRUSHER: Signs of stress, adrenaline by-products higher than baseline.
But that's a normal reaction after sudden fright. All brain functions
check out okay. 
PICARD: What happened, Deanna? 
TROI: It wasn't what I saw, it was more what I felt. I looked into the
mirror, and it seemed a stranger was staring back at me from behind my
own eyes. As if my face was a mask. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Captain Picard. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: I've found something, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: I'm on my way. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Can I help you? 
WORF: Perhaps not. 
CRUSHER: Worf, you came in here for something. 
WORF: A warrior does not complain about physical discomfort, but the
Captain ordered us to report anything out of the ordinary. 
(he is rubbing his right wrist) 
CRUSHER: Are you in pain? (she scans it) How did this happen?
