TROI PICARD REX PULASKI LWAXANA MADELINE RIKER

[Hill's outer office]

PICARD: So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activate
programme. 
MADELINE: Leaving, Dix? You're not to Rex's bar, are you? 
PICARD: Rex's bar? Why do you ask? 
MADELINE: It's one of the messages I left on your desk. 
PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? 
MADELINE: Me? Have a drink with you? 
PICARD: Why not? 
MADELINE: There ain't no why not about it. It's just that this is the
first time you ever asked. 
PICARD: Is that a problem? 
MADELINE: Not for me, but you'd better take this. (a revolver) 
PICARD: Why? 
MADELINE: Because if we're going to Rex's bar, you're gonna need it.

[Rex's Bar]

(Mostly empty, Moonlight Serenade playing, ceiling
fans turning lazily) 
REX: Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this?
(newspaper) Germany's getting ready to invade England. 
MADELINE: Who's going to stop them? 
REX: Somebody'd better. 
MADELINE: Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs to
do is fight in another world war. 
PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did end
with the United States taking its place as a dominant world power and
cultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century.
Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement.
Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourth
century. 
REX: I don't know if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you've got
a snootful already. 
PICARD: What's this? 
REX: The usual. 
PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. 
REX: What else? 
(Picard takes Madeline's proffered cigarette, Rex lights it. He takes a
puff then looks at it from arms length) 
REX: And for the lady? 
MADELINE: Rye and ginger. 
(Rex taps the bar and rubs his fingers together. Picard imitates him) 
PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I must
remember not to let this happen again. 
REX: Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're up the
sleeve halfway to my collar. 
PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? 
REX: No, it's on account of Jimmy Cuzzo. 
PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. 
MADELINE: He's why I gave you the gun. 
PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot's
Claw. 
MADELINE: Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They
never would have nailed him if it hadn't been for you. Your testimony
got him arraigned. 
REX: Yeah. Yours and mine. 
PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face him
alone. 
REX: I don't want to face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us
together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight. 
PICARD: And if it doesn't? 
REX: Then you just have to kill him. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Bridge, this is Doctor Pulaski. 
[Bridge]

PULASKI [OC]: We've just completed the transfer.
The Antedeans are now in Sickbay. 
RIKER: Acknowledged, Doctor. 
(Lwaxana and Homn enter) 
TROI: Mother, what are you doing here? You can't just stroll on to the
Bridge whenever you feel like it. 
LWAXANA: I didn't just stroll on, dear. I took the turbo tube, or
whatever you call it. The Captain's not here? 
RIKER: He is busy elsewhere, ma'am. 
LWAXANA: I have other interests as well. 
TROI [telepath]: You're scheming something, Mother. Don't try to fool
me, I can tell. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: You're always so melodramatic, Little One. I'm not
scheming, I'm deciding. 
TROI [telepath]: Mother, not him. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: And why not him? He's adorable.
