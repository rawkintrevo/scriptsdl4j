[Transporter room]

CREWWOMAN: Doctor Brahms is ready to transport,
sir. 
LAFORGE: Okay, bring her over. 
(Leah beams in) 
LAFORGE: Hi. I mean, welcome aboard, Doctor Brahms. I'm Lieutenant
Commander Geordi La Forge, Chief Engineer. 
LEAH: La Forge. So you're the one who's fouled up my engine designs. 
(and stalks past him straight out of the room)

[Engineering]

(Leah is getting the full tour) 
LEAH: The matter-antimatter ratio has been changed. The mixture isn't
as rich as regulations dictate. 
LAFORGE: Experience has shown me that too high a ratio diminishes
efficiency. I worked with the mixture until I got the right balance. 
LEAH: The magnetic plasma transfer to the warp field generators doesn't
correspond to the recommended specs. 
LAFORGE: Right. Again, I adjusted the flow. Sometimes things happen a
little differently here is space than they do on the drawing board. 
LEAH: Is that a criticism, Commander? 
LAFORGE: No, of course not. It's just a well known fact. There's theory
and there's application. They don't always jibe. 
LEAH: You've charted a completely new swap-out schedule for main
components replacement. 
LAFORGE: You bet. I found the Starfleet estimates for the MTBF units to
be unrealistic. I simply determined my own schedule based on
observation and experience. 
LEAH: Is that going to be your only defence, Commander, that same tired
rhetoric? Out here in the field we learn things you designers couldn't
possibly understand. 
LAFORGE: In the first place, Doctor, I'm not aware of needing any
defence. And in the second place, if you're determined to be. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Doctor Brahms, you have an incoming message on
subspace. 
LEAH: I'd like to hear this message privately. 
LAFORGE: In my office. Be my guest. 
LEAH: Thank you.
