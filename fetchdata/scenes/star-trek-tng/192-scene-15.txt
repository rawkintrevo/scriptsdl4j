OGAWA: Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: That's all right. What's happened? 
OGAWA: I thought you should see this. 
(Alyssa shines a torch on Susanna) 
CRUSHER: Her skin is simulating light. A radiant reaction. Some sort of
mimetic ability? 
OGAWA: That's not all. Her body temperature is dropping. 
CRUSHER: It's as if she's generating a disruptive field. I can barely
get any readings off her now. What's her rate of transformation? 
OGAWA: It's increasing. 
CRUSHER: That's not possible. It should have been inhibited by the
T-cell stimulator. Unless. If there's a foreign body inside her that's
producing these changes, something like a viral crche. 
OGAWA: A very small one if our scans haven't found it. 
CRUSHER: I want a full genetic analysis. We're going to examine any
abnormality we find no matter how insignificant it seems.

HICKMAN [on monitor]: One to transport. 
LAFORGE: Computer, delete the audio. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. Freeze visual. Whose shadow is that? 
COMPUTER: Please restate question. 
LAFORGE: Computer, the shadow currently displayed in section B three,
what is its source? 
COMPUTER: Unknown. 
LAFORGE: Come on, it's got to belong to somebody. Computer, replay a
visual of the last time index. No audio, and slow to fifty percent.
Okay, Brevelle's behind the camera ,Susanna and I head off in that
direction. Mendez moves off that way. Freeze visual. Now, magnify four
times, and spectrally enhance those shadows. (there's the other shadow
in the background) Computer, do you have sufficient data to compile a
holographic simulation of this visual record? 
COMPUTER: A simulation would be limited to areas scanned by the visual
recording device. 
LAFORGE: Good, fine. Scan the entire record and then recreate it on
holodeck three.
