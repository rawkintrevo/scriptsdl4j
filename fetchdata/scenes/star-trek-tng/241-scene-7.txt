jumpy used did idea quarters kiss seen actually hope

[Starbase - Marta's quarters]

PICARD: I just couldn't make him understand. 
MARTA: At least he did finally give it up. 
PICARD: Yes, but he didn't take it very well. 
MARTA: Oh, you know Corey. He'll forget all about it by tomorrow. 
PICARD: I hope you're right, because he and I were friends for years
after this. I mean, I hope we will be. You know, you keep smiling at
me. 
MARTA: Well, I've just never seen you like this before. You're so
serious. 
PICARD: Do I really seem that different? 
MARTA: Maybe I'm just not used to seeing you in your officer's uniform.
No, it's more than that. You do seem different. Well, I'm not
complaining or anything. I think it suits you. 
PICARD: Really? 
MARTA: Yes. It's very attractive. Johnny. Haven't you ever thought
about us getting together? 
PICARD: Yes, I have, actually. I've thought about it for a long time. 
MARTA: Why didn't you ever say so? 
PICARD: I don't know. And at this moment, I really have no idea why
not. 
MARTA: You've said so now. 
(and they kiss) 
(next morning, uniforms are scattered on the floor, and a hand tickles
Picard's ear) 
Q: Morning, darling. Feeling a little jumpy this morning? Are we
guilty, perhaps? 
PICARD: I don't feel guilty about anything, Q. 
Q: No? We're just friends, Q, nothing more. 
PICARD: And we're still friends. 
Q: So what's next? 
PICARD: I don't know. What I do know is, things will be different. 
Q: I'm sure.
