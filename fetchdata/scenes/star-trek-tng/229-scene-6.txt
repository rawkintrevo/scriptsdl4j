TROI: I would imagine that your self-discipline
helps you in your work.
ALKAR: I don't know about that. I think maybe my biggest asset is
patience. I let everybody else talk until they're exhausted, and when I
start, they're too tired to argue.
TROI: You're going to need all your patience at Seronia. I can't
imagine how you'll get the two sides talking to each other. 
ALKAR: Neither can I. I won't know that until I get there. I tend to
feel my way through a situation.

ALKAR: Deck nine. If I were empathic like you, I'd
have a real advantage.
TROI: I thought Lumerians were empathic.
ALKAR: Only with each other, not other species. So, I don't have any
idea what you might be feeling just now.
TROI: Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness,
serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that you
hope to draw out in others.

ALKAR: Tell me, Counsellor, have you ever been
involved in diplomatic negotiations?
TROI: Several times with Captain Picard. There have been instances when
having an empath along has been helpful.
ALKAR: I'm sure. I could use some of that help. Would you come with me
when we reach Seronia?
TROI: If the Captain authorises it, of course I will.
ALKAR: Good. I hope to see you again.

MAYLOR: You're late.
ALKAR: Mother, I told you that I'd be gone for over an hour.
MAYLOR: You're late because of her. Have you mated with him yet?
TROI: What?
MAYLOR: That's what you want, isn't it?
ALKAR: Mother, please, come in. 
MAYLOR: I can always tell. The ones with a certain look in their eye. 
TROI: I'd better go.
MAYLOR: And I'll tell you this. If you do, you'll regret it the rest of
your life.
ALKAR: Mother. come in please. You should lie down.
