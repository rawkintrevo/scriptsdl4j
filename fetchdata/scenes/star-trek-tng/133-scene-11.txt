[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Chief O'Brien, are you ready? 
O'BRIEN: I have the original coordinates of the Darwin isolation lab,
Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: Quickly, please. 
O'BRIEN: Shuttle One, hold your position. 
[Shuttlecraft]

DATA: Holding. 
(Pulaski gives herself a painkilling hypo) 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by to transport. 
PULASKI: It wasn't your fault. 
(The boy is beamed away) 
PICARD [OC]: Tell us what you need, Doctor. 
PULASKI: There's nothing you can do, Captain. I'm not going to make
myself an exception to the Darwin quarantine. Shuttle One out. 
DATA: What is your condition, Doctor? 
PULASKI: Not exactly up to factory specs. I'm sorry. The pain is
tolerable, thank you. 
DATA: Shall I set course for Darwin Station? 
PULASKI: We're already under quarantined. What do we have to lose?

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: We can no longer consider the Darwin
Station crisis our most immediate concern, although Doctor Pulaski's
condition is inseparably linked with that emergency. Her safe return
and that of Commander Data must take priority, please. 
TROI: Shouldn't Doctor Pulaski be involved in this? 
RIKER: From what we've seen on the Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not have
time to help herself. 
TROI: Well I suggest we beam them both back onto the ship. Commander
Data is most likely immune and surely the biofilter will 
O'BRIEN: The transporter's biofilter won't protect us. The boy was
transported twice already and still infected Doctor Pulaski. 
LAFORGE: Couldn't we adjust the biofilter? We could alter the filter to
screen out whatever it is that's causing the disease. 
PICARD: But we don't know what's causing the disease. We can't protect
ourselves against the unknown. What we need is some kind of filter that
doesn't depend on known biological factors. 
O'BRIEN: We might try the trace. 
RIKER: The transporter trace? 
O'BRIEN: As you know, the transporter keeps a record of all
transmissions, a pattern if you will. Usually it's just stored for
security purposes, but if we use the transporter trace to control the
reconstitution process 
LAFORGE: I don't think it's ever been tried quite that way before, but
theoretically it is possible. 
O'BRIEN: I'd have to make extensive modifications. 
PICARD: Then do it. It seems we have no alternative. 
RIKER: Where will we get the trace pattern? The Doctor's never used our
transporter. 
PICARD: Never? 
RIKER: No. She's a woman of very strongly held opinions, sir. What was
her previous assignment? 
TROI: Her last ship was the Repulse. 
PICARD: Bridge, Picard. Contact the USS Repulse using subspace
captain's priority channel.
