SUSANNA: Captain Picard's wrong. The way to handle
this is to get back down there with a dozen away teams, fan out from
the shuttle, we could cover a lot of ground in a hurry. Use proximity
detectors, infrared sensors. 
(Susanna's hands are shaking) 
LAFORGE: Susanna. 
SUSANNA: Oh, Geordi, it's started. What if what happened to the others
is happening to me? 
LAFORGE: You don't know that. Suz, I'm here, and I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, okay? Okay, come on.

(science station LCARS 40274)
DATA: During microscopic examination of the torn uniform, I discovered
these alien skin cells. 
SUSANNA: Source? 
DATA: Undetermined. 
LAFORGE: Without something else to cross-reference, it would take us
weeks to try and identify them. 
DATA: Fortunately, we have more evidence. We were able to determine
that these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any known
Tarchannen life form. 
SUSANNA: If we're pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are
involved, I think I should tell you that we didn't find tracks like
that during the original investigation. 
DATA: The planet is subject to frequent sandstorms. Footprints might
have been obliterated prior to your arrival. Doctor Crusher and I will
begin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these with
some known life form.
