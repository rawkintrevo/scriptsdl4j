LAFORGE COMPUTER HICKMAN OGAWA CRUSHER DATA SUSANNA

[Engineering]

HICKMAN [on monitor]: One to transport. 
SUSANNA [on monitor]: I want to make another sweep of the perimeter. La
Forge, you start at building four. Mendez and Brevelle begin at two.
I'll take five. 
(and the log ends) 
LAFORGE: All right, computer. Analyse audio elements from time index
fourteen four seven to fifteen five eight. List all anomalies. 
COMPUTER: No audio anomalies present. 
LAFORGE: Any subspace projections, z-particle emissions,
interferometric frequencies? 
COMPUTER: No subspace projections present. No z-particle emissions
present. No interferometric patterns present. 
LAFORGE: Damn. 
DATA: Geordi. May I inquire how your investigation is proceeding? 
LAFORGE: It's not. 
DATA: Have you attempted an audio analysis? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Data. And a spectrographic analysis, and a screen for
ionising radiation. I even ran an enhancement for micro-seismic
disturbances. I've tried it all, okay? I'm sorry, Data. 
DATA: There is no need for an apology. Perhaps if you indulged in a
brief rest period, you would be able to approach this problem with a
fresh point of view. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, you're probably right, Data, but I've got to keep
scanning these records while I can. 
DATA: May I can assist you? 
LAFORGE: If I knew what I was looking for. Rally, Data, I think it's
just a matter of me going over it, maybe finding something I forgot.
I'll let you know if I come across anything, all right? All right,
computer, one more time.

OGAWA: Sorry to disturb you, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: That's all right. What's happened? 
OGAWA: I thought you should see this. 
(Alyssa shines a torch on Susanna) 
CRUSHER: Her skin is simulating light. A radiant reaction. Some sort of
mimetic ability? 
OGAWA: That's not all. Her body temperature is dropping. 
CRUSHER: It's as if she's generating a disruptive field. I can barely
get any readings off her now. What's her rate of transformation? 
OGAWA: It's increasing. 
CRUSHER: That's not possible. It should have been inhibited by the
T-cell stimulator. Unless. If there's a foreign body inside her that's
producing these changes, something like a viral crche. 
OGAWA: A very small one if our scans haven't found it. 
CRUSHER: I want a full genetic analysis. We're going to examine any
abnormality we find no matter how insignificant it seems.
