JAKE: To sign onto a freighter. Tell my father I'm
sorry. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: You can tell him yourself, in person. Bring
that ship back at once. 
JAKE [OC]: No. 
[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: I can't face him. I'm leaving. (alarm sounds)

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Captain, he's unbalanced the dilithium
reaction. 
[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: I've lost power! 
[Bridge]

RIKER: All he's got left are his manoeuvring jets,
Captain. 
LAFORGE: At this trajectory, he'll enter the atmosphere and burn up at
two hundred kilometres. 
PICARD: Probable impact? 
DATA: Atmospheric entry seventy eight seconds. 
PICARD: Options? 
WORF: Tractor beam? 
RIKER: Not possible. He's too far away for a positive lock. 
TASHA: He's out of transporter range. 
REMMICK: Captain, you are completely responsible for that boy's life. 
PICARD: Mister Remmick, either get out of my way and keep quiet, or I
will have you removed from the Bridge. Viewer on shuttle cockpit. 
TASHA: Visual on main viewer. 
PICARD: Mister Kurland. 
JAKE [on viewscreen]: I can't get the engine started. What am I going
to do? I'm going to crash. 
RIKER: He needs another fifty seconds for the core to cool down before
it can restart. 
PICARD: Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you back.
