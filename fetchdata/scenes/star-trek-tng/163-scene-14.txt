good calls people wish suppose know picked coordinate trivial

[Sickbay]

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Triage team to main shuttlebay. 
GARRETT: Lieutenant, how's the ship? 
CASTILLO: We've restored minimal shields and the forward phaser banks.
Still no photon launchers or warp drive. 
GARRETT: Concentrate on the weapon systems. From what Captain Picard
told me, the Federation can use all the help it can get. 
TASHA: And soon. Our sensors have picked up Klingon warships in this
sector, Captain. 
GARRETT: Why wasn't I informed, Mister Castillo? 
CASTILLO: Captain, you shouldn't 
GARRETT: As senior officer, I want you to be my liaison to the
Enterprise-D. Coordinate with Tactical. 
TASHA: That's me, Captain. 
CRUSHER: Where do you think you're going? 
GARRETT: I'm resuming my duties, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Captain, you need at least another twenty four hours. 
GARRETT: Nonsense. Doctors always over-protect their patients. 
CRUSHER: And captains always push themselves too hard. 
GARRETT: Doctor, my ship and crew need me now. Twenty four hours might
as well be twenty four years.

[War room]

PICARD: I need more. 
GUINAN: There is no more. I wish there were. I wish I could prove it.
But I can't. 
PICARD: Then I can't ask them to go back. 
GUINAN: You've got to. 
PICARD: Guinan, they will die moments after they return. How can I ask
them to sacrifice themselves based solely on your intuition? 
GUINAN: I don't know. But I do know that this is a mistake. Every fibre
in my being says this is a mistake. I can't explain it to myself so I
can't explain it to you. I only know that I'm right. 
PICARD: Who is to say that this history is any less proper than the
other? 
GUINAN: I suppose I am. 
PICARD: Not good enough, damn it. Not good enough. I will not ask them
to die. 
GUINAN: Forty billion people have already died. This war's not supposed
to be happening. You've got to send those people back to correct this. 
PICARD: And what is to guarantee that if they go back they will
succeed? Every instinct tells me this is wrong, it is dangerous, it is
futile. 
GUINAN: We've known each other a long time. You have never known me to
impose myself on anyone or take a stance based on trivial or whimsical
perceptions. This time line must not be allowed to continue. Now, I've
told you what you must do. You have only your trust in me to help you
decide to do it.

[Ten Forward]

(Guinan enters) 
TASHA: Deflector shield technology has advanced considerably during the
war. Our heat dissipation rates are probably double those of the
Enterprise-C, which means we can hang in a firefight a lot longer.
Guinan? 
GUINAN: Have you ordered yet, Tasha? 
TASHA: No, not yet. Is anything wrong? 
GUINAN: Not a thing. What can I get for you? 
TASHA: Just a couple of TKLs. We're in a hurry. Oh, this is, Lieutenant
Castillo. 
(Guinan moves slowly away) 
TASHA: First time for everything. 
CASTILLO: First time? 
TASHA: It's just that I've never seen anything bother her before. 
CASTILLO: What's a TKL? 
TASHA: Standard rations. Food replicators are on minimum power, so
everything else is diverted to defensive systems. So where was I? 
CASTILLO: You've told me more about tactical in an hour than I learned
my last year in the Academy. 
TASHA: You're going to need it, Lieutenant. 
CASTILLO: Hey, I've known you a whole day now, Lieutenant. I won't
salute if you won't. What did she call you? Tasha? 
TASHA: Yeah. 
CASTILLO: Most everybody just calls me Castillo. My mother calls me
Richard. 
TASHA: Okay, Castillo. 
CASTILLO: No, I think maybe I'd like it better if you called me
Richard. 
TASHA: Richard. 
PICARD [OC]: This is the Captain. Senior officers will report to my
Ready room immediately. 
TASHA: So much for lunch.
