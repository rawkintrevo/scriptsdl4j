[Particle fountain laboratory]

LAFORGE: The radiation is setting up a field
ionisation effect, Captain. We've got less than a minute to beam out of
here. 
PICARD: Is that everybody? 
FARALLON: Where's Takenta? He was over there, near the impeller
control. 
LAFORGE: I'll get him. Takenta! 
(Geordi disappears from view then there's a big flash) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge! Stand by to transport. 
FARALLON: Captain, you'll be trapped here. 
(Picard beams them away) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge! Mister La Forge, are you all right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm fine, Captain. I only caught the edge of it. He's
dead.

RIKER [OC]: Chief, do you have them? 
KELSO: They're here, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: Is everyone all right? 
FARALLON: We're fine, sir. But Captain Picard, Commander La Forge and
one of my men

[Bridge]

FARALLON [OC]: Are still on the station. 
RIKER: Kelso, can you get them off? 
[Transporter room]

KELSO: I'm trying, sir. I can't establish a pattern
lock. 
FARALLON: Commander we barely managed to transport off ourselves. The
field ionisation is too intense.

DATA: Commander, the particle fountain is
continuing to surge. At the present rate, the radiation in the station
core will reach fatal levels in twenty three minutes.
