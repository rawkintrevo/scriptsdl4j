[Bridge]

RIKER: I'm glad to hear you say so, sir. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, this vessel is about to undergo extensive
repairs requiring my personal supervision. 
RIKER: What about Risa? 
PICARD: Some other time, Number One. 
TROI: Will, I've just had some terrific news. 
RIKER: Really? 
TROI: There's an excellent chance my mother may be joining us on
Starbase twelve. 
PICARD: Your mother? 
TROI: She's returning home from a conference on Achrady Seven, and
she's going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some time
visiting with us. 
RIKER: That's wonderful, Deanna. 
TROI: She mentioned how much she was looking forward to seeing you
again, Captain. 
PICARD: Did she? Commander, could I have a word with you? 
(As Riker and Picard leave, Deanna clasps her hands and mouths Yes!) 
[Ready room]

RIKER: Is something wrong, Captain? 
PICARD: Tell me, Number One, is the entire crew aware of this little
scheme to send me off on holiday? 
RIKER: I believe there are two ensigns stationed on deck thirty nine
who know nothing about it. 
PICARD: I suppose this means I can look forward to a week of continual
harassment on this subject? (signs) I admit, I've been feeling a little
fatigued.
