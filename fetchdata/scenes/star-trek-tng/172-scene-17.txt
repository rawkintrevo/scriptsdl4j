GRAX FAREK WORF PICARD TROI LWAXANA TOG

[Tog's quarters]

TROI [telepath]: Mother, we're out of the cell and
we're trying to contact the Enterprise, but we can't do it without
Tog's access code. Do you think you could manage to 
LWAXANA [telepath]: Say no more, Little One. 
TOG: Lwaxana, you and I are going to make such a wonderful team. With
your telepathy and my cunning, I foresee 
LWAXANA: A very profitable future.

[Bridge]

WORF: Subspace interference is subsiding, sir.
Communications have been restored. 
PICARD: Good. Contact Commander Riker on Betazed. 
WORF: Message coming in from Betazed, sir. Priority One. 
PICARD: On screen. 
GRAX [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, at last. We have been trying to
reach you for two days. 
PICARD: Our communications have been blocked by the nebula, Reittan. Is
there a problem? 
GRAX [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid so, Captain. Lwaxana, Deanna and
Commander Riker have disappeared.

[Tog's quarters] 
TOG: I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you. You
have fulfilled all my expectations. 
LWAXANA: How sweet. 
TOG: Farek thought it was a bad idea, but I knew better. 
LWAXANA: How clever. 
TOG: I knew best. I always know best. 
LWAXANA: How repugnant. 
TOG: What? 
LWAXANA: I said, how romantic. I can't resist a man who knows what he
wants and goes after it. 
TOG: That's me. That's why I'm DaiMon of this ship. I take charge of
every situation. More to the left, woman. 
LWAXANA: Whatever you say. My darling, would you care for something to
drink? 
TOG: You're so attentive. 
LWAXANA: Does your food synthesiser know how to make an Arcturian Fizz?

TOG: I don't think so. 
LWAXANA: They have certain pleasure-enhancing qualities. 
TOG: Mmm 
LWAXANA: Let me teach your computer how to make one. I'll need your
access code. 
TOG: Yes, my beloved. Computer, access code kayee yooree dahtayee 
FAREK: Tog! Be silent! I knew you were not to be trusted. 
LWAXANA: Doctor Farek! I was going to make DaiMon Tog a drink. 
FAREK: Save your lies for this fool. 
LWAXANA: Oh please, don't listen to him. Don't. No, he's misunderstood
me. 
FAREK: No, Tog. You have misunderstood. You have been tricked by a sly
female who finds you repulsive. 
TOG: She was only trying to serve me a drink. 
FAREK: You almost gave her complete access to the ship's computer. A
security breach severe enough to cost you your command.! It's time you
took my advice. Let me study her. 
TOG: Study her? Your mind probes could kill her. 
FAREK: You brought her aboard for her telepathic powers. If I can
determine what neural configuration gives her those powers, I may be
able to duplicate them. We could still profit from this. 
TOG: I don't know. 
FAREK: A true DaiMon would not be blinded by lust. Give her to me, or I
may be forced to report your transgressions. 
TOG: Very well. Take her.
