LAFORGE WORF PICARD SALIA PULASKI WESLEY GUARD ANYA

[Engineering]

(Geordi is doing what Wesley should have been
doing, when Anya and Worf enter) 
WORF: This is the dilithium crystal chamber. Our Chief Engineer, Geordi
La Forge.

ANYA: What is that? What are you doing? 
LAFORGE: Nothing to be concerned about. Just performing some routine
adjustments. 
ANYA: I wasn't aware that the deuterium control conduit required
routine adjustments. 
(She goes up in the lift to join Geordi) 
LAFORGE: I perform periodic inspections on all engineering systems. 
ANYA: In this case you seem to have found a malfunction. 
LAFORGE: It's not a malfunction. It's simply that a minute defocused
area has developed. It lowers our operating efficiency. 
ANYA: It could also lead to excess prion production. 
LAFORGE: Our computer would detect that. 
ANYA: Unless, of course, it too is malfunctioning. 
LAFORGE: Look, I really have to get this finished. 
WORF: Anya. Please come with me. 
ANYA: I will be back to check your progress. 
[Corridor]

(Outside Salia's quarters, Wesley is stopped by the
security guard) 
GUARD: Ensign Crusher, what can I do for you? 
WESLEY: Nothing. 
(The door opens, eyes meet, a jaw drops) 
GUARD: Is there a problem? 
WESLEY: No. 
SALIA: Could you show me how to work the food dispenser? 
WESLEY: Sure.

[Salia's quarters]

WESLEY: Really, it's quite simple. You just tell
the computer what you want and it prepares it for you. 
SALIA: Oh. What should I order? 
WESLEY: I don't know. what do you like? 
SALIA: I'd like something sweet. 
WESLEY: I know. Computer, Thalian chocolate mousse. 
(Salia samples it with her finger) 
SALIA: It's a wonderful sensation. 
WESLEY: On Thalos Seven they age the beans four hundred years. 
SALIA: You've been there? 
WESLEY: It's one of my favourite places. 
SALIA: It must be fun to visit a planet like that. 
WESLEY: It's the best part of being on the Enterprise. 
SALIA: I've studied about some of them, but to see them, that would be
wonderful. Tell me about some of the other
places you've been. 
WESLEY: Oh, there's too many. 
SALIA: The only world I've known is Klavdia Three. 
WESLEY: It's about time we changed that. 
SALIA: How? 
WESLEY: Come with me.

[Sickbay]

(Worf and Anya enter) 
PULASKI: I'll be with you in a moment. 
ANYA: What's wrong with him? 
PULASKI: Andronesian encephalitis. 
ANYA: That disease is contagious. 
PULASKI: Very unlikely. Our air filtering system can handle 
ANYA: But there is a chance. 
PULASKI: If you mean mathematically, yes, the probability is not zero. 
ANYA: I cannot rely on your primitive technologies. Kill the patient! 
PULASKI: What? 
ANYA: Destroy the patient. Immediately! 
PULASKI: Now, you calm down. 
ANYA: If you won't take action, then I will! 
(She morphs into a big nasty version of the furry creature she was with
Salia) 
PULASKI: Security to Sickbay! Hurry! 
(Worf wrestles with the creature which is larger than himself, as
Picard and guards arrive) 
PICARD: Wait! Hold your fire. 
(Anya returns to humanoid shape) 
PICARD: Worf! 
PULASKI: What is she? Keep her away! 
ANYA: Do not interfere! 
PULASKI: She wants to kill Hennesey! 
ANYA: His disease threatens Salia. 
PULASKI: Captain, there is no chance of contagion. 
PICARD: The situation is under control. 
ANYA: That's not good enough! 
PICARD: Well, it will have to be. 
ANYA: Your powers are infinitesimal compared to mine. 
PICARD: Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You are to
remain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of this
voyage. Is that clear? 
ANYA: Very. 
PICARD: Keep her under guard. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Anya stalks out) 
WORF: Wait for me. What kind of creature is she? 
PICARD: I've never seen anything like her. 
PULASKI: There is mention in the galactic zoological catalogue of a
species called allasomorph, which is supposed to possess the power to
alter their molecular structure into other life forms. 
WORF: Such a creature would make a perfect protector. 
PICARD: I want a Security team stationed outside Sickbay, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Captain, what if Anya transforms? 
PICARD: Improvise.

[Holodeck]

(Wesley and Salia are on a planetoid orbiting a
ringed planet) 
SALIA: Can a place so remarkable truly exist? 
WESLEY: Yes. There are many more. All of them are different. 
SALIA: I've learned about them. That's all I did on Klavdia Three, was
learn. I know so much, but I've seen so little. 
WESLEY: Think of what you have to look forward to. This is a great time
to be alive. 
SALIA: For you. 
WESLEY: For both of us. This is all just beginning. We've only charted
nineteen percent of our galaxy. The rest is out there, just waiting.
Look what we've already discovered. 
SALIA: I have never seen anything so wondrous. 
WESLEY: Wait. Computer, Rosseau Five. 
(They are standing on a fragment of rock drifting in a purple haze) 
SALIA: It's breathtaking! 
WESLEY: Yes. 
SALIA: And you've been to this place? 
WESLEY: Someday, you'll visit Rosseau Five, and many other places, all
more spectacular. 
SALIA: If only it were possible. 
WESLEY: Listen. 
SALIA: What is it? 
WESLEY: In a moment, the harmonic resonance from the neutrino clouds
will become synchronous. 
(Musical notes sound) 
SALIA: It's so beautiful! It's like this place has a voice and is
trying to speak to us. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. 
WESLEY: Someday, you'll see it all for yourself. Look over there.
