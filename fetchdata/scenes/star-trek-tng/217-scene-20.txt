RIKER SOREN WORF

[Riker's quarters]

(Riker is putting items in a small case when the
doorbell rings) RIKER: Who is it? 
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Worf. 
(Riker hides the case) 
RIKER: Come in. 
WORF: Commander, I have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the
null space. 
RIKER: Fine. Leave it, I'll take a look at it later. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Thank you. You're dismissed. 
WORF: Commander, I am aware of what transpired on the planet surface.
Are you by any chance considering an unannounced visit? I will go with
you. 
RIKER: Lieutenant. 
WORF: Sir, you are my commanding officer. If you order me to stay on
board, I will obey. But I ask you not to give that order. A warrior
does not let a friend face danger alone. 
[Courtyard]

(we are watching a group of people in a room,
through binoculars) 
RIKER: Something's happening. They're leaving. 
(Worf and Riker make their way through the plants to the edge of the
courtyard, and watch people leaving) 
RIKER: Okay. (he steps out) Excuse me. I need to speak to her alone for
a moment. 
(Worf and Riker scuffle with Soren's guards, then Riker drags her off
into the bushes) 
SOREN: Wait. 
RIKER: Don't worry. We'll be out of here in a minute. 
SOREN: Please. don't. 
RIKER: All right, 1e're almost there. 
SOREN: You cannot do this. 
RIKER: I won't let them hurt you. You'll be safe on the Enterprise. 
SOREN: I am so sorry. It was my fault that you got involved in all
this. 
RIKER: Everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to be
fine. 
SOREN: No, it is not. 
RIKER: What are you talking about? 
SOREN: It was all a mistake, and I should have realised it from the
beginning. 
RIKER: What? 
SOREN: That I was sick. I had these terrible urges, and that is why I
reached out to you. But it was wrong, and I see that now.
I do not understand how I could have done what I did. 
RIKER: Maybe Doctor Crusher can treat you and bring you back to the way
you were. 
SOREN: Why would I want that? 
RIKER: Soren. I love you. 
SOREN: I'm sorry.
