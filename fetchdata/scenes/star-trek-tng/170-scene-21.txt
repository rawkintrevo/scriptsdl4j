WESLEY: Now approaching Beta Agni Two, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, put us into close orbit. Mister Data, scan. My
apologies, Mister Worf. Scan the colony's subsurface water. 
WORF: Scanning. Tricyanate contamination confirmed. Levels approaching
forty two parts per million. 
RIKER: Area affected? 
WORF: Thirty square kilometres. 
PICARD: Any indication of the source? 
WORF: Highest concentration eight kilometres west of the colony. 
RIKER: Adjust target coordinates. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to bridge. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: According to these figures, the eighty one
kilos 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Of hytritium should be enough to
neutralise the contamination. 
WESLEY: Now approaching target coordinates. 
PICARD: Launch probe.
WORF: Probe on target. Hytritium entering water table. Disbursement
slightly faster than expected. Sir, something unusual. 
PICARD: Specify. 
WORF: I'm getting concentrated tricyanate readings of seventy grams per
cubic centimetre at the source coordinates. Much higher than would
normally occur. 
PICARD: Computer, report on geologic instability on Beta Agni Two. 
COMPUTER: No significant geological activity has been recorded on Beta
Agni Two since the settlement of the Federation colony. 
PICARD: Number One, perhaps you'd better take an away team down and
have a closer look. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. Doctor Crusher, join me in Transporter room three. 
CRUSHER [OC]: On my way. 
RIKER: Mister Worf?

[Fajo's den]

(Data is trying to imitate La Gioconda's smile. I
wonder if this is one of the copies Doctor Who wrote 'this is a fake'
on?) 
FAJO: I would very much like our relationship to change. 
DATA: You may expect me to use every means at my disposal to resist
your wishes. 
FAJO: Why can't you just comply? Why do you argue all the time?
Couldn't you just go sit on the chair? Come on. Go on, sit on the
chair. 
DATA: I do not intend to sit in the chair. 
FAJO: You will. You may believe it right now, but you will. 
(There is a wall safe behind one of his display items, a necklace. Fajo
tries to hide the combination from Data, then removes a gun) 
FAJO: Have you ever seen one of these, Data? 
DATA: It is a disruptor. 
FAJO: Well, no. It's a prototype for a Varon-T disruptor. 
DATA: The Varon-T disruptor is banned in the Federation. 
FAJO: Oh, yes. They only manufactured five of them. I own four. I sleep
with one under my pillow at night, and I sleep very well knowing it's
there too. Do you know why? 
DATA: It is a most lethal weapon. 
FAJO: It's not just lethal. It's vicious. It tears a body apart, inside
out, and very slowly too by your phaser standards. It's tortuous. A
very, very painful death. I've always wanted to try this. 
DATA: It is doubtful you will destroy me since you assign so much value
to possessing me. 
FAJO: That goes without saying. Please come in. 
(Varria enters) 
FAJO: Varria, how long have we been together, my dear? 
VARRIA: Fourteen years. 
FAJO: Fourteen wonderful years they were too. She was barely an adult
when I found her. She was idealistic, naive, full of dreams. And I made
those dreams come true, too, didn't I? I'm going to miss you. 
(Fajo points the disruptor at Varria) 
DATA: Fajo. 
(Data is sitting on the chair)

[Beta Agni Two]

(The three beam down onto rock ledges just above
the water) 
CRUSHER: The contamination's been neutralised. The water's clean. 
WORF: Curious. The process of neutralisation should have taken several
hours. Naturally
occurring tricyanate does not respond this quickly. 
RIKER: Are you saying it's not naturally occurring? 
WORF: There are no natural trace elements present in these tricyanate
crystals. 
RIKER: If it's artificial, then we're talking about sabotage. 
CRUSHER: With tricyanate? That's hard to believe. It's slow to
assimilate, difficult to replicate, and hard to transport. There are a
lot easier ways to poison a water supply. More effective ways too. 
RIKER: Can you think of any reason a saboteur would choose tricyanate? 
CRUSHER: It might pass for a natural disaster. And since there's only
one way to treat it, with hytritium, maybe somebody figured we couldn't
locate it. It is hard to find. 
RIKER: Then it really was lucky, wasn't it, that we were able to find
hytritium when we did. And just enough hytritium for this crisis?
