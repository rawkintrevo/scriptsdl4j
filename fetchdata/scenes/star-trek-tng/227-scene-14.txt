GUINAN TROI CLEMENS RIKER

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: History has to fulfill itself. Even Picard
knew that. 
RIKER: You were there in the cavern. You know what happened. What am I
supposed to do? 
GUINAN: If I told you what happened in that cavern, it would affect any
decision you'd make now. I can't do that. I won't. 
RIKER: Not telling me might affect my decision. Did you think of that?
We're talking about Jean-Luc Picard. I can't sit around and hope it all
works out. I've got to do something.

(Troi is back in her purple catsuit) 
CLEMENS: Any place that doesn't stock a good cigar doesn't rank high in
my book. 
TROI: If you must have one, I'm sure we can replicate it for you. 
CLEMENS: You think one of these imitations can take the place of a hand
wrapped Havana? 
TROI: I wouldn't know. 
CLEMENS: Well, that's the problem I see here. All this technology it
only serves to take away life's simple pleasures. You don't even let a
man open the door for a lady. 
TROI: I think what we've gained far outweighs anything that might have
been lost. 
CLEMENS: Oh? Well, I'm not so impressed with this future. Huge
starships, and weapons that can no doubt destroy entire cities, and
military conquest as a way of life? 
TROI: Is that what you see here? 
CLEMENS: Well, I know what you say, that this is a vessel of
exploration and that your mission is to discover new worlds.
