PICARD RIKER WORF

[Ready room]

RIKER: I can't just leave her there. They'll give
her these psychotectic treatments. I don't know what to do. 
PICARD: Well, I could talk to Noor. Perhaps there's a way to work
something out. 
RIKER: Sir, their minds are set. They don't want to hear another
alternative. 
PICARD: Then I'm not sure that there's much that we can do. 
RIKER: There has to be. My relationship with Soren is not trivial.
She's very important to me. It's my fault that this happened. I have to
help her. 
PICARD: Will, if you've come here for sanction to take matters into
your own hands, I can't give it to you. 
RIKER: I know that, but I have to do something. 
PICARD: Interfering in the internal matters of the J'naii is prohibited
by the Prime Directive. 
RIKER: I'm aware of that. 
PICARD: If you violate it, you may jeopardising your career. Starfleet
doesn't take these matters lightly, Will. I can't defend you if you go
too far. Do you understand that? 
RIKER: You've made yourself very clear, sir. 
PICARD: Don't risk everything you've worked for. 
RIKER: Thank you. May I be excused now?

[Riker's quarters]

(Riker is putting items in a small case when the
doorbell rings) RIKER: Who is it? 
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Worf. 
(Riker hides the case) 
RIKER: Come in. 
WORF: Commander, I have the plan for deploying warning buoys around the
null space. 
RIKER: Fine. Leave it, I'll take a look at it later. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Thank you. You're dismissed. 
WORF: Commander, I am aware of what transpired on the planet surface.
Are you by any chance considering an unannounced visit? I will go with
you. 
RIKER: Lieutenant. 
WORF: Sir, you are my commanding officer. If you order me to stay on
board, I will obey. But I ask you not to give that order. A warrior
does not let a friend face danger alone.
