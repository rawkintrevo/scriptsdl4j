BATAIJR ADMINISTRATOR DOCTOR PICARD ELINE MERIBOR

[Town square]

ADMINISTRATOR: Kamin, what do you hope to
accomplish? Spreading rumours that the planet is doomed. There could be
chaos. 
PICARD: The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will
recognise what they mean. 
ADMINISTRATOR: I won't be a party to your making trouble. 
PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Your observations, your findings, our scientists reached
those same conclusions two years ago. Well, what did you expect us to
do? Make it public? Can you imagine the effect? 
PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of this
world? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just
beginning to launch small missiles. 
PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. You
simply cannot let this civilisation die. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Enough! There is a plan in work. I cannot tell you more
than that. 
BATAI JR: Father! 
PICARD: What is it? 
BATAI JR: It's Mother. Hurry.

[Living room]

PICARD: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Kamin. I'm sorry. 
ELINE: You see? I go to any lengths to get your attention. 
PICARD: You always did have a flair for the dramatic. 
ELINE: Doctor, thank you. (Doctor leaves) Batai, leave us alone for a
moment. I need to talk to my husband. 
(Batai leaves) 
ELINE: Did you show the Administrator your evidence? 
PICARD: I didn't have to. They already knew. 
ELINE: So, he won't throw you off the Council? 
PICARD: No. 
ELINE: Good. Remember, put your shoes away. 
PICARD: I promise. 
(Eline dies) 
[Living room]

(a very old man and a young boy are crawling on the
floor) 
PICARD: Gotcha! Now I gotcha. 
MERIBOR: Some children are certainly making a lot of noise in here. 
PICARD: You shouldn't be outside so long. It's damaging, you know that.

MERIBOR: I'm wearing plenty of your skin protector. 
PICARD: How about you, young man? Do you wear your skin protector
outdoors? You do? Good boy. 
BATAI JR: (now with his father's hairline) Happy day, everybody. It's
time to go see the launching. 
PICARD: What launching? What's he talking about? 
MERIBOR: They're sending up a missile, Father. We're going to watch it.

PICARD: I'm not going anywhere to watch anything. 
BATAI JR: Come on, Kamie. Hurry up now. Let's go see the launching. 
(Batai puts a hat on his nephew and they leave) 
PICARD: It breaks my heart to look at him. 
MERIBOR: Who? 
PICARD: My grandson. It breaks my heart. He deserves a rich, full life,
and he's not going to get one. 
MERIBOR: Please come, Father. 
PICARD: Why didn't I hear anything about a launching?
