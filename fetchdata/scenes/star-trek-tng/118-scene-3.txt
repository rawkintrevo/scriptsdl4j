DATA: Sensors indicate that the shield is
electromagnetic, a complicated light refracting mechanism. 
PICARD: A cloaking device? 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: It's got to be pretty sophisticated to hide an entire planet .

WORF: We're being scanned, sir. 
PICARD: We'll let them know our peaceful intention. Open hailing
frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. 
(A young woman comes on the viewscreen) 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: I am Rashella. Welcome to Aldea. 
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the USS Enterprise. We come in
peace. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We know. 
PICARD: We've heard the stories about Aldea, but frankly I never
believed they could be true. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Our shield has confused outsiders for
millennia, Captain. 
PICARD: That's a very long time to have such technology. Why do you
reveal yourselves to us now? 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: We're eager to meet in person to discuss
that, and other subjects of mutual interest. 
PICARD: We're ready anytime. 
RASHELLA [on viewscreen]: Excellent! 
(Rashella and a man appear on the deck, and seem dizzy at first) 
RADUE: We mean no harm. 
RASHELLA: Our arrival seems to have startled you. 
PICARD: It was a little sudden. 
RADUE: I'm Radue, First Appointee to Aldea. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard. 
CRUSHER: Captain, they haven't been through decontamination. 
PICARD: Our medical doctor is concerned that you didn't go through the
regular transporting procedure. 
RASHELLA: You couldn't transport us. The only way through our shield is
our way, Captain. Our cloaking device may be off, but our shield is
operating. We've brought you small tokens of welcome. 
(She hands over a bouquet) 
RADUE: And a personal invitation to a celebration on Aldea. 
PICARD: That would be delightful. Number One, assemble the away team. 
RADUE: We will prepare for your arrival, Commander Riker. 
RIKER: How do you know 
RADUE: Your name? We've been monitoring your ship's communications. We
must return now to Aldea. Our eyes are very sensitive to bright light.
Rashella. 
(They vanish again) 
PICARD: Amazing. To exist only in that dreamworld of mythology and then
suddenly to be here, right in front of us. 
RIKER: Now we know who placed the bread crumbs. We're not here by
accident. 
PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? 
TROI: They want something from us, something we value greatly. So much,
that they're afraid we won't part with it. 
RADUE [OC]: We are ready to receive you, Commander Riker, and two of
your colleagues? 
(Riker, Troi and Crusher disappear) 
PICARD: Interesting choices.

[First Unit]

RADUE: I hope Duana and I know how to greet you
properly, Commander.
