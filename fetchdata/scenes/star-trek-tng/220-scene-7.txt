[Corridor]

LWAXANA: I'll bet you've never been to a colony of
free spirits. 
ALEXANDER: What do they do there? 
LWAXANA: Whatever they want. Artists, philosophers, free thinkers and
people who don't quite fit other people's rules. Personally, I come for
the mud baths. You, oh, you're going to adore the mud baths. Computer?
I'm assuming you have the Parallax Colony of Shiralea VI? 
COMPUTER: That programme is available. 
LWAXANA: Oh, good. Then run it for us, dear.

[Holodeck - Shiralea]

(they're greeted by a multicoloured head in a
bubble, who pulls faces and changes his colours)
ALEXANDER: What's that? 
LWAXANA: A Wind Dancer. He stands guard. You see, only those whose
hearts are joyous may enter. Come on. 
(a fire eater blows a perfect triangle of flame, then a five pointed
star) 
LWAXANA: Fire sculptor. We'll chat with her later if you're not wearing
anything flammable. 
JUGGLER: Hello. A few of us were just gathering together for our
laughing hour. Would you care to come laugh with us? 
LWAXANA: Actually, we were about to experience a mud bath. 
JUGGLER: Were you? What an idea! My friends and I will join you. One
can always laugh in the bath. 
ALEXANDER: Do you ever drop one? 
JUGGLER: Oh, no. No, no. These are my worlds. I protect them. I am a
master of worlds, and they fly only as I wish. (to an identical couple)
We're having guests for laughing hour. Would you care to join us! 
YOUNG MAN: We'd love to! (see end of transcript as well) 
YOUNG WOMAN: No, thank you. 
YOUNG MAN: Yes. 
YOUNG WOMAN: No. 
YOUNG MAN: Why do you always say no when I say yes? 
YOUNG WOMAN: I don't. 
YOUNG MAN: You just did. 
YOUNG WOMAN: There you go again. You are the most negative person! 
ALEXANDER: Why are they arguing? 
JUGGLER: They're friends. They love contradiction. They thrive on
challenge. They flourish in conflict. 
ALEXANDER: Then why are they friends? 
LWAXANA: Who else are you going to fight with if not your friends? 
POET: Hold! What is the lesson for today? 
LWAXANA: Damned if we know. We're just here for some fun and a mud
bath. 
POET: Every moment requires a purpose. 
LWAXANA: No, it doesn't. 
POET: Every purpose requires a plan. 
JUGGLER: He does this every day. Usually while everybody's food gets
cold. It's rather boring. 
POET: The higher the fewer! 
LWAXANA: Well that's a conversation stopper if I ever heard one. 
WOMAN: I am not! 
MAN: Yes, you are. 
WOMAN: I am not. 
ALEXANDER: Excuse me! If you're going to argue, you should remember,
the higher the fewer. 
LWAXANA: So, my little warrior wants to see more in life than just
fighting. The mind opens, and in creeps wisdom.
