(Beverly is giving the presentation) 
CRUSHER: Nanites. Tiny machines built from the atom up. Designed to
have exposure only to the inside of nucleii during
cellular surgeries. Until then, they are kept tightly confined in a
non-functioning state. 
DATA: These are not ordinary nanites. 
CRUSHER: No, they have evolved. 
STUBBS: Evolved? How does a machine evolve? 
WESLEY: It's true. I am responsible for this. I allowed two of the
nanites to interact for a school project. I wanted to increase their
capabilities. And they escaped. 
PICARD: School project? Just how far have these things evolved? 
WESLEY: Well, this is a sample of linear memory crystal from our
computer core. 
(The screen shows a scene out of Pacman) 
RIKER: It's like candy to them. 
CRUSHER: As you can see, they're able to mechanically replicate
themselves. 
DATA: It is conceivable that with each new generation they enhance
their own design. The rate of evolution would be extraordinary. 
PICARD: How many generations are we dealing with here? 
DATA: Engineering, display computer core processor four five one,
element zero two nine nine. 
DATA: Increase magnification, factor one thousand. 
PICARD: Can it be possible they know what they're doing? 
RIKER: Why would they attack us? 
STUBBS: Why does a mosquito bite your ear? and who cares? The answer is
simple. Call an exterminator. 
CRUSHER: Doctor Stubbs, these nanites are now working with a new
collective intelligence. Operating together. Teaching each other
skills. 
STUBBS: Oh really. I'm sorry but this is nonsense. You can't have a
civilisation of computer chips. They're made in a plant in Dakar,
Senegal. I've watched the construction. 
CRUSHER: Then how do you explain what we've seen here? 
STUBBS: It's no more mysterious than watching a strain of the Leutscher
virus reproduce itself. And that at least is a bona fide lifeform. How
many disease germs and viruses have you destroyed in your time, Doctor
Crusher? 
PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, we cannot exterminate something that may or may
not be intelligent. 
STUBBS: My good Captain. 
PICARD: There's still time. Ensign, will you work with mister Data to
try to remove them safely. If things get worse, we'll use stronger
measures.
