(Troi and Picard are listening on the open comm.
channel) 
MICKEY D [OC]: Let's you and me take it outside. 
BELLBOY [OC]: When I was a kid, I used to look up to you guys. The
suit, the fancy shoes. I really thought that made you somebody, but
you're nobody. She could make something out of her life 
(Picard mutes it) 
TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? 
PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on down
there is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. 
BELLBOY [OC]: Like Rita. She could do something with her life. She
could be somebody if she only had the chance. 
TROI: With your permission, sir. 
(Troi leaves) 
MICKEY D [OC]: She is somebody. She's my girl. 
BELLBOY [OC]: You got her on the stuff. That's the only reason she
stays with you. Because you feed her sickness. 
[Lobby]

BELLBOY: You got to let me help her. 
MICKEY D: Well why don't we just go outside and talk about it? 
CLERK: Just watch yourself. 
BELLBOY: Don't worry. 
RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. 
(Mickey D shoots the bellboy in the back as he walks to the door. The
customers scream) 
MICKEY D: You should have listened to me, kid. No woman's worth dying
for. Killing for, not dying for. 
(Mickey D leaves) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise.

foreign investors. Sale price, twelve point five million United States
