(Picard is pacing back and forth) 
WORF: Sir, three minutes to resonator launch. 
PICARD: Where is he? 
RIKER: He'll be here. 
(Data and Sarjenka enter) 
PICARD: He has brought a child onto my ship and on my Bridge. 
RIKER: I'm sure Mister Data has a very good explanation. 
DATA: I do, sir. She was frightened and did not wish to be left alone 
PICARD: Mister Data, kindly assume your station. Counsellor, will you
escort her to Sickbay. 
SARJENKA: No, Data, no. I'm scared. Don't make me go. 
TROI: It's all right, no one's going to hurt you. 
SARJENKA: No! 
TROI: We'll just go and get a treat, and then 
SARJENKA: No.
DATA: Captain, I will see to it that she is not in the way. 
WORF: One minute to launch. 
TROI: Come on, it'll be all right. 
SARJENKA: No. Just leave me alone. I want Data. 
DATA: Counsellor, allow me. Please. Sarjenka, no one will harm you.
These are my friends. 
PICARD: Mister Data, take your station and keep her with you. This does
concern her. 
WORF: Ten seconds. 
DATA: I will require my hand. Thank you. 
WORF: Firing torpedoes. 
(Four balls of red light streak away) 
DATA: Sensors locked on probes. 
WORF: Torpedoes have reached their targets. 
DATA: Resonators activated. Harmonic sequences have begun. 
SARJENKA: What are you doing? 
DATA: We are attempting to quiet your planet. If we succeed, there will
be no more quakes, no more
volcanoes. 
PICARD: Ensign, when should the results be known? 
WESLEY: They should happen very quickly, sir. 
SARJENKA: And my parents and brothers? 
DATA: Captain, sensors indicate a planetwide reduction in tectonic
stress levels. 
WESLEY: It worked. We did it. 
DATA: Your parents will be safe now. 
SARJENKA: You did this for me? 
DATA: Look, Sarjenka, there is your home.
PICARD: Data, escort her to Sickbay. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Doctor. 
PULASKI [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: Data and the alien are on their way down. What would be
involved in removing all memory of her communication with Data

[Pulaski's office]

PICARD [OC]: And her visit to this ship? 
PULASKI: Assuming her brain structure is similar to ours, the memories
would be stored chemically on the neurons of the cerebral cortex.
They're also time dependent. I would have to scan for age of the
chemical links, and try to find

PULASKI [OC]: The relevant neurons. 
PICARD: Well, do your best.
