RIKER OBRIEN LAFORGE PICARD SELA MOVAR

[Bridge]

RIKER [on monitor]: We're ready, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take the
Romulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated? 
LAFORGE [on monitor]: Not long Romulan sensors are as good as ours. 
PICARD: Very well. Energise the network. 
[Romulan command centre]

MOVAR: There's an increase in tachyon emissions
from the Federation fleet. 
SELA: They're using the beams as a detection field. 
MOVAR: If we try to cross it, they'll see us, even if we're cloaked. 
SELA: Issue orders to begin work on a way to penetrate this field. In
the meantime, we'll have to convince Captain Picard he should leave.

O'BRIEN: Captain, I'm picking up something directly
ahead. Romulan ship decloaking. Shall I raise shields? 
PICARD: Not yet. 
O'BRIEN: They're hailing us, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. Tasha? 
SELA [on viewscreen]: No, Captain. I am Commander Sela. The woman you
knew as Tasha Yar was my mother. Deploying an invasion fleet along
our border is a clear act of aggression, Captain. It will not be
tolerated. You have twenty hours to recall your ships and
return peacefully to Federation territory.
