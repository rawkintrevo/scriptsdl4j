RIKER KLINGON GOWRON WORF PICARD DATA HELMSMAN

[Gowron's Bridge]

GOWRON: Status! 
KLINGON: Aft shields down. 
HELMSMAN: Warp coils damaged.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Red alert. 
DATA: A second ship has joined the attack on the Bortas. 
PICARD: It's begun.

[Gowron's Bridge]

GOWRON: Send an emergency signal to any loyal
ships! 
HELMSMAN: Impulse engines not responding! 
(there's an explosion. Worf takes the Klingon's station) 
GOWRON: Engage emergency override! 
WORF: Override engaged. Disruptors still not responding.

[Bridge]

DATA: The Bortas has lost her port shields, sir. It
is unlikely they will withstand another hit at that quarter. Their
primary life support has failed, sir. 
RIKER: The Bortas has put out a general distress call. 
PICARD: Ensign Riol, plot a course to take us safely away from the
combat area. Half impulse. 
RIKER: Captain, the Bortas is Gowron's ship. If he's the legitimate
leader of the Empire, shouldn't we help him? 
PICARD: If we go to the aid of the Bortas, we'll be dragging the
Federation into a Klingon civil war. 
RIKER: What about Worf? 
PICARD: Ensign, engage.
