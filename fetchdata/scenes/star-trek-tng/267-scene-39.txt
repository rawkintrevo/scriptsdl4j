RIKER: Report. 
LAVELLE: We completed a long range scan of the area, sir. The escape
pod doesn't seem to be out there. 
DATA: It is possible that at this distance we are unable to distinguish
the pod from the inorganic matter normally present in space. 
RIKER: Try narrowing the scan field. See if you can pick up any
biosigns. 
LAVELLE: Sir, it would help if I knew what kind of life signs to look
for. 
RIKER: You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns. 
LAVELLE: Yes, sir. 
(Picard enters) 
RIKER: Nothing yet. The pod is thirty two hours overdue. 
WORF: Sir, I recommend we launch a probe to increase the range of our
sensor sweeps. 
RIKER: Launching a probe into Cardassian space would be a treaty
violation. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, prepare a probe and launch when ready. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Probe launched, sir. 
DATA: Sir, I am detecting signs of debris two hundred thousand
kilometres inside Cardassian space. Its mass and composition indicate
it could be the remains of a Federation escape pod. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We have intercepted a
Cardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captor
and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassian
space.

Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you that a member of the crew,
Ensign Sito Jaxa 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Has been lost 
[Sickbay]

PICARD [OC]: In the line of duty. She was the
finest example of a Starfleet 
[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Officer, and a young woman of
remarkable courage 
[Ready room]

PICARD: And strength of character. Her loss will be
deeply felt by all who knew her. Picard out.
