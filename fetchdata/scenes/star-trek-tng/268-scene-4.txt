GARVIN DATA SKORAN APPRENTICE

[Town square]

(at the blacksmith's forge) 
SKORAN: You, Ice man, where'd you find this? 
DATA: I do not know. 
GARVIN: I told you, he's lost his memory and we're calling him Jayden
for now. 
SKORAN: Jayden, huh? The metal is slightly warm. 
GARVIN: All the fragments are like that. 
(Skoran hit's it with a hammer on the anvil) 
SKORAN: It's obviously been tempered and milled. The lustrous quality
of the metal is so pure. This wasn't made in any forge I've ever seen.
Will you sell them? 
GARVIN: You want them? 
SKORAN: The metal's malleable enough to make some jewellry. 
GARVIN: They belong to Jayden. Do you want to sell them? You're going
to need money. 
DATA: You may be right. But I do not wish to sell all the fragments.
They may provide a clue to my identity. 
SKORAN: I'll give you twenty doraks for half the lot. 
GARVIN: Agreed. 
(the wooden base of the anvil cracks, and the anvil falls on the
apprentice's leg) 
APPRENTICE: My leg! My leg! Get it off! Get it off! 
(townsfolk rush to help) 
SKORAN: We need a lever. 
GARVIN: It'll be all right. Don't struggle. It will only 
(Data lifts the anvil easily) 
GARVIN: Jayden, put it down. 
DATA: I believe the support structure on the anvil collapsed because
some of the wood had rotted. Did I do something wrong, Garvin? 
GARVIN: No, just unexpected.
