PICARD RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE WESLEY

[Ready room]

(a chat over afternoon tea served in the silver tea
service) 
WESLEY: Let's see. I have Novakovich for anthropology and Horne for
creative writing. 
PICARD: Walter Horne? Is he still teaching? 
WESLEY: Yeah, he is. And he's good too. And you'll be pleased to know I
took your advice. The first week that I was there, I went and met
Boothby. 
PICARD: How is old Boothby? I hope he didn't tell you a lot of stories
about me. 
WESLEY: He didn't remember you, sir. At first. I found an old yearbook
photo and he remembered you right away. He said he's very proud of you
that you're Captain of the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Is he still tending grounds, or have the years finally caught
up with him? 
WESLEY: Not that I can tell. He took me on a grand tour of the place.
He showed
me every single blade of grass, practically. 
PICARD: I had the very same tour. 
WESLEY: Sir, what do the initials A F stand for? 
PICARD: AF? 
WESLEY: Boothby said he caught you carving those initials into his
prized elm tree. 
PICARD: AF. Just an acquaintance of mine. (goes misty) Wesley, if you
meet someone whose initials you might want to carve into that elm tree,
don't let it interfere with your studies. I failed organic chemistry
because of AF. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I need you in Sickbay immediately. 
PICARD: On my way.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He came in complaining of a servo
malfunction but my scans came out negative. Then he just collapsed. 
PICARD: What have you found? 
CRUSHER: His biosystems and positronic functions seem to check out, and
his power cells are active. 
LAFORGE: From what I can tell, his higher functions are intact, but the
signals aren't getting from his brain to the rest of his body. It's
like he's in a coma. 
RIKER: Data performs self diagnostic routines on a regular basis. We
should take a look at his logs. They may reveal something. 
LAFORGE: I recommend going through his quarters, as well. You never
know what we might find. 
PICARD: Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed.
