PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Devidia cavern]

DATA [OC]: Triolic waves. 
LAFORGE: That explains a few things. How much, Data? 
DATA [OC]: A positive displacement of point zero zero four percent. 
LAFORGE: Well, whatever or whoever is there, we're out of phase with
it, but we're only talking by a fraction of a second. 
WORF: A fraction of a second would make them invisible? 
LAFORGE: A millisecond, a year, it wouldn't make any difference. If
what we're reading is true, then we're occupying the same space but in
a different time. 
RIKER: How do we compensate? 
DATA [OC]: Commander, we might be able to 
[Bridge]

DATA: Manipulate the synchronic distortion. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Maybe. If we were to create a contained subspace force
field. 
[Devidia cavern]

LAFORGE: But to get a point zero zero four
variance, we'd need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator, Data.
I don't think we've got one that would come close. 
DATA [OC]: Yes, we do. 
[Bridge]

DATA: It is built into my positronic decompiler. It
will be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. 
PICARD: (hesitation) Proceed, Mister Data.
