TROI CRUSHER WORF PICARD RIKER WESLEY ARMUS DATA

[Shuttlecraft]

(Armus, and presumably Riker, are draped over the
craft again)
TROI: Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! 
ARMUS [OC]: He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would
diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. 
TROI: I can. 
ARMUS [OC]: Should I let him go? 
TROI: You only ask to torment me. 
ARMUS [OC]: Perhaps. 
TROI: How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? 
ARMUS [OC]: And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that
much? 
TROI: Yes. Without hesitation. 
ARMUS [OC]: Just for him? 
TROI: No, not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others.
Armus, you have me. Let them go. 
ARMUS [OC]: Perhaps. Ah, another has arrived. 
[Planet surface]

(Picard is with the team. Armus slithers over to
them) 
ARMUS: You are the one in charge? 
PICARD: (to Data) Is Commander Riker alive? 
ARMUS: Answer, Tin Man. 
DATA: I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to
alleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive. 
ARMUS: Maybe. Don't you want to ask me what I want? 
PICARD: No. 
ARMUS: Not even to protect your own existence? 
PICARD: I want to see my people in the shuttle. 
ARMUS: Entertain me. (Picard shakes his head) Then I will do it myself.
You, Tin Man. 
(Data moves jerkily, and points his phaser at Beverly, then Picard) 
ARMUS: Now tell me, how would you feel if you were the instrument of
death for your leader? 
PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. 
DATA: I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, I
would not be the instrument of his death. 
ARMUS: Perhaps killing the Doctor would engender more feeling? 
DATA: No, the control is still yours. 
ARMUS: And what about you, Doctor? Are you ready to die? Tell me you
are not afraid. 
CRUSHER: I am afraid. 
ARMUS: Beg me to spare you. 
CRUSHER: No. 
ARMUS: One of you is going to die, and you, Doctor, get to choose. You
don't like that, do you? 
CRUSHER: Then I choose myself. 
ARMUS: No. You are going to live. One of them dies. 
(Data's arm swings around and ends pointing the phaser at his own head)

ARMUS: Maybe this one. Though I would not call it death, since he is
only a device. Tell me, Tin Man, how does it feel to face your own
extinction. 
DATA: Curious. (the phaser drops) You are capable of great sadism and
cruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. 
ARMUS: So what do you think? 
DATA: I think you should be destroyed. 
ARMUS: A moral judgment from a machine. 
PICARD: Data. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. 
ARMUS: I have your man in here, and the others in the shuttle. 
PICARD: It doesn't matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. 
ARMUS: I can kill them. 
PICARD: Yes. You can. But only I can command them. They follow my
orders. 
ARMUS: Have them amuse me. 
PICARD: Only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first. I must
see them. 
ARMUS: Not possible. 
PICARD: Then our business with you is concluded. 
ARMUS: And you claim you care about your comrades. 
PICARD: I care. Which is why I must see them. 
ARMUS: You want to see your people? Then, here. Look at this one. 
(Riker is tossed out of the slick, covered in oil) 
CRUSHER: He's alive. Don't move. 
PICARD: Is he all right? 
CRUSHER: All signs show normal. 
RIKER: So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. 
PICARD: Now, let me see the others. 
ARMUS: No. 
PICARD: I will not allow my people to entertain you until you do. 
ARMUS: They are incapable of entertaining me. 
PICARD: I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up the
away team immediately. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. 
ARMUS: They may leave. 
(The team are beamed away) 
PICARD: Now. 
ARMUS: I want to leave this place. 
PICARD: You want me to give you transportation? 
ARMUS: For which I will trade you lives. 
PICARD: I must see my people in the shuttle. 
ARMUS: Will you give me what I want? 
PICARD: I have the means. But first I must see my people. 
ARMUS: If you must. 
[Shuttlecraft]

(Armus transports Picard into the shuttlecraft) 
PICARD: Troi, are you all right? 
TROI: Yes, but Ben is not. 
PICARD: He's alive. 
TROI: Were you able to help Tasha? 
PICARD: No. Troi. Troi, we must talk. I believe it's possible to
outmanoeuvre this creature, and beam you and Ben back up to the ship.
We've been monitoring the energy field that surrounds the shuttle. When
the creature is here, the field weakens. Do you know why? 
TROI: The creature is filled with rage. Undirected, unfocused rage.
When he confronts it, his guard goes down because he's feeling it
instead of suppressing it. Acknowledging his needs makes him
vulnerable. 
PICARD: What caused the rage? 
TROI: He was left here. Abandoned. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The forcefield will have to drop below two
point seven before we can beam them up. 
[Planet surface]

(Picard is brought back from the shuttlecraft) 
ARMUS: Satisfied? 
PICARD: Yes. 
ARMUS: Then can we leave? 
PICARD: Where do you want to go? Do you want to try to find those who
left you here? 
ARMUS: She told you about them. 
PICARD: How long have you been here? 
ARMUS: Since they left. A very long time. 
PICARD: A long time to be alone. 
ARMUS: Save your compassion. It's revolting. You offer it like a prize
when in fact it's an insult. 
PICARD: Because you feel unworthy. 
ARMUS: You overrate your gift. You humans are puny, weak. 
PICARD: But our spirit, it is indomitable. 
ARMUS: And still you die from a flake of my power. 
PICARD: A great poet once said, 'all spirits are enslaved that serve
things evil'. 
ARMUS: You do not understand. I do not serve things evil. I am evil. 
PICARD: Oh, no, you are not. 
ARMUS: I am a skin of evil left here by a race of Titans who believed
if they rid themselves of me, they would free the bonds of
destructiveness. 
PICARD: Yes. So here you are. Feeding on your own loneliness. Consumed
by your own pain. Believing your own lies. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Set the computer. When the energy level
reaches two point six point two zero five, automatically beam up Troi
and Prieto. We'll do a parallel transport on the Captain. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
[Planet surface]

PICARD: You say you are true evil? Shall I tell you
what true evil is? It is to submit to you. It is when we surrender our
freedom, our dignity, instead of defying you. 
ARMUS: I will kill you, and those in there. 
PICARD: But you will still be here. In this place. For ever. Alone.
Immortal.
