(Data is at a table, reading a PADD) 
NU'DAQ: Good evening, Commander Data. 
DATA: Captain. 
NU'DAQ: Is there any word yet on the missing fragment? 
DATA: The computer is processing the data. I will be notified as soon
as there is any information. 
NU'DAQ: Commander, your reputation for physical strength is known even
in the Klingon Empire. You are familiar with the B'aht Qul challenge? 
DATA: I am familiar with many Klingon rituals, including the B'aht Qul.

(Nu'Daq sits opposite Data, both elbows on the table and hands raised.
Data mirrors him, putting his hands inside Nu'Daq's) 
NU'DAQ: Wa' Cha' Wej 
(Data instantly pushes Nu'Daq's arms back onto the table, and returns
to his PADD) 
NU'DAQ: Maw' tok! 
(Nu'Daq head-butts Data, but falls backwards himself) 
DATA: My upper spinal support is a polyalloy designed to withstand
extreme stress. My skull is composed of cortenide and duranium. 
NU'DAQ: I understand your intellectual prowess is equally impressive.
If I were to learn of the results from the computer search before the
others, the Klingon Empire would have a strategic advantage. A being of
your abilities would go far in the Empire. 
DATA: You are attempting to bribe me. 
NU'DAQ: Not at all. 
DATA: You suggested a plan that would work to your advantage, one that
I would be capable of executing. You then implied a reward. Clearly you
were 
NU'DAQ: Commander, never mind.

(a display is beeping) 
LAFORGE: What the hell? Computer, perform a level three diagnostic on
the primary defensive systems. La Forge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: What is it, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: You might want to come down here. I found something that I
think you should see.
