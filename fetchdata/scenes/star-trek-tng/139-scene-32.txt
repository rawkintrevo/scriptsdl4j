PULASKI P RIKER PICARD

[Sickbay]

(Troi has got to Sickbay before Picard) 
PULASKI: He's very agitated. 
P2: I must get to the shuttle. 
PICARD: I know. Do you know where you are? 
P2: The Enterprise. 
PICARD: Yes, but you're only vaguely aware of it. And me? Do you know
who I am? No, you don't, do you. 
P2: I must go. 
PICARD: Release him. 
PULASKI: Do you know what you are doing? 
PICARD: No. Release him. 
PULASKI: Security to Sickbay. 
PICARD: No. Security, disregard that order, and clear all personnel,
repeat, all personnel, from Shuttlebay two. 
(Picard 2 gets up) 
PICARD: I don't want any distractions. You, stay here.

[Corridor]

PICARD: You made a decision to leave the ship? 
P2: I must. 
PICARD: Why? 
P2: The energy in the vortex wants me. 
PICARD: You're certain. 
P2: Yes. It's an entity, a life form, which recognises the Enterprise
as an entity with me as its brain. And it wants me.

[Turbolift]

P2: Shuttlebay two. 
PICARD: What's your other option? 
P2: This is our only chance. If I leave, it may be distracted long
enough for the Enterprise to escape. 
PICARD: You're wrong. If you leave, the Enterprise will be destroyed.
Don't you remember? You saw it happen. 
P2: If I don't leave the ship, then the Enterprise will be destroyed.

[Corridor]

PICARD: If that's true, then help me. We want the
same thing. We both want the Enterprise to be safe. But there is a
piece of information I don't have. What is it? 
P2: It's me. 
PICARD: You? 
RIKER [OC]: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes. 
RIKER [OC]: We are about to lose warp drive. 
PICARD: Understood. 
P2: Understood.
