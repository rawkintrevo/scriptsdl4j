PICARD KLINGON DATA KVADA

[Klingon Bridge]

K'VADA: I know my duty, Captain. When I am given
orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets. I want to know why we
are going on this mission.
PICARD: I'm sorry. It's a classified matter.
K'VADA: You're going after the defector, aren't you?
PICARD: Defector? 
K'VADA: Do you think information like that stays a secret? Ambassador
Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
PICARD: Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of co-ordinates
near Romulus and to bring us back, and that is all I am prepared to
discuss.
K'VADA: If we are discovered by the Romulans it means death for us all.
PICARD: I realise that.
K'VADA: Hechu' ghoS. Very well, Captain. We have set a course for
Romulus.

[Klingon quarters]

K'VADA: It may not be what you're used to on a
Starfleet ship.
PICARD: Quite nice. Thank you.
DATA: Captain K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own?
K'VADA: Both. We have limited space. We are a military ship, not a
pleasure craft.
PICARD: Of course. This will be fine.
K'VADA: You'll sleep Klingon style. We do not soften our bodies by
putting down a pad.
PICARD: Good. I prefer it that way.
K'VADA: You'll take your meals with us but we do not serve Federation
food.
PICARD: I've been looking forward gagh. Haven't had it for quite a
while. Very fresh.
KLINGON [OC]: MeH HoD.
K'VADA: Jatlh! 
KLINGON [OC]: MeHmaH ghoS. 
K'VADA: So'wl'chu'. Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral
Zone. You mean to do this, do you?
PICARD: Yes. I do.

First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6. The
Enterprise is nearing Qualor Two, home of a Federation surplus depot
operated
by the Zakdorn. We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array
ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
