(This time, Beverly isn't dressed for bed. She
carefully puts her glass down on another table out of harm's way. As
soon as she turns out the lights, the voices start and she grabs her
tricorder to record them.) 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, I just heard what sounded like voices in my room, but
no one else is here. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Sensors just picked up something strange, too. We're
checking it out. 
CRUSHER: I'm on my way. 
(She grabs her lab coat and it knocks the glass of the table. Some
things just have to happen.)

LAFORGE: Looks like you managed to record six point
two seconds worth. Let's see if we can filter the signal and clear it
up a little bit. 
CRUSHER: Then I wasn't just hearing things? 
DATA: The sound itself appears to have been real. However the acoustic
energy does not correspond to any ship's system, nor to any voice
communications sent at the time you heard it. 
CRUSHER: Then where did the sound come from? 
LAFORGE: You heard the voices at the same time our localised subspace
scan picked up a dekyon field distortion. The two may be related. Let's
give another listen. 
DATA: Computer, perform a narrow bandwidth analysis. Eliminate all
non-vocal waveform components. 
CRUSHER: Can we isolate the voices? Find out what they're saying? 
DATA: Computer, continuous playback please. There are approximately one
thousand voices overlapping. The voices are those of the Enterprise
crew. Our voices.
