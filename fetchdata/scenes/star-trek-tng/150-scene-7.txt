[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Call up the cross-section of computer core
processor four five one. I want to see elements zero two hundred
through zero three hundred. 
CREWMAN: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: In order to get some power, I had to by-pass the computer
core. Essentially hotwire the connection. Whoa, whoa, right there. Look
at that lesion. No wonder we're coming apart at the seams. It's
definitely some kind of continuing disintegration, but from what I
can't tell you. And I haven't the slightest idea how to stop it. 
WESLEY: It's just a mechanical problem, though, right? 
LAFORGE: Increase magnification, factor fifty. I don't know, Wes, but
looking at it. You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say someone
had climbed in there and started taking it apart.

[Laboratory]

(Wesley returns to check on the contents of a jar.
The lid had been open while he was asleep. The bottom falls out of his
world) 
[Ten forward]

(Wesley is on hands and knees, placing traps by the
wall behind the bar) 
WESLEY: Guinan! I didn't think anyone would be here. 
GUINAN: I've never been any good at being confined to quarters, as my
husbands will attest to. What's that? 
WESLEY: I'm just setting traps. 
GUINAN: I run a clean place. 
WESLEY: I know. It's not that. It's. I'm scared, Guinan. I think that
everything that's been going wrong might be my fault. 
GUINAN: You want to tell me about it? 
WESLEY: I've been working on my final project for Advanced Genetics.
It's on nanotechnology. I've been studying the nanites we have in the
Sickbay genetic supplies. They're these little tiny robots with
gigabytes of mechanical computer memory. They're designed to enter
living cells and conduct repairs. They're supposed to remain confined
to the lab. 
GUINAN: Are you saying there are nanites loose? 
WESLEY: Two of them, that's all. I just wanted to see how they would
interact and function in tandem. You see, in my experiment, I had
proposed a theory that by working together they could combine their
skills and increase their usefulness. It was working. 
GUINAN: So you made better nanites. 
WESLEY: I was pulling an all-nighter to collect my final data. I fell
asleep. And when I woke up I
saw the container had been left open. It's just a science project. 
GUINAN: You know, a doctor friend once said the same thing to me.
Frankenstein was his name. 
WESLEY: They're really harmless. I mean, they're equipped with only the
most basic skills. It's almost impossible they could be responsible 
GUINAN: Almost. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher to Wesley Crusher. 
WESLEY: Go ahead. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I stopped by your quarters, Wes. I assumed you'd be
there, since you're off duty. 
WESLEY: I know. I just I had some things to do 
CRUSHER [OC]: Orders are orders, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: On my way. You won't tell anybody, will you? I know. I will. If
it's true. 
GUINAN: Wes, do you think you're going to get a good grade? 
WESLEY: I always get an A. 
(Wesley leaves)
GUINAN: So did Doctor Frankenstein.

Captain's log, supplemental. Our computer core has
clearly been tampered with and yet there is no sign of a breach of
security on board. We have engines back and will attempt to complete
our mission, but without a reliable computer, Doctor Stubbs' experiment
is in serious jeopardy.
