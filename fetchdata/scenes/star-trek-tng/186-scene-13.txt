PICARD: Mister Data, how long until we clear
Cardassian space? 
DATA: At our present speed, three hours, twenty minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to Admiral Haden at Starfleet.
Inform him of our projected time of arrival. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has changed course. 
GUEST2: What is he doing? 
PICARD: Ensign, change course to pursue. Mister Worf, will you hail
Captain Maxwell? 
WORF: No response, sir. 
RIKER: Data, project his new course. 
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix is heading directly for a Cardassian vessel
point one two light years from our location. 
GUEST2: He'll attack that ship just as he did the others. 
PICARD: Continue the hail, Mister Worf. Priority one message. Do you
know what that ship might be? 
GUEST2: I imagine it's a supply ship, headed for the research station in
the Kelrabi system. 
WORF: The Phoenix still does not respond, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp eight. Overtake him. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix has accelerated to warp nine. We will not be
able to reach him before he intercepts the Cardassian ship. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp nine. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, arm phasers. Continue the hail. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Captain, Chief O'Brien was Maxwell's Tactical officer. 
PICARD: Get him up here. 
(a short time later, O'Brien enters) 
DATA: Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out of warp. They have reached the
Cardassian vessel. 
RIKER: Slow to impulse. 
WORF: Vessels are within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER: Has the Phoenix activated its weapon systems? 
DATA: Negative, sir. Their phaser banks are not armed. 
RIKER: What about the Cardassians? 
DATA: Our sensors are unable to determine status of the Cardassian
defensive systems. Their ship is running with a high powered subspace
field. 
PICARD: Mister O'Brien, your former Commander, a Federation Captain, is
about to place me in the position of firing on his ship. I need your
knowledge of the man. How he thinks, what he's capable of doing. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Sir, Captain Maxwell is hailing us. 
PICARD: On screen. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: All right, Picard. You need proof? You've got
it now. 
PICARD: Captain Maxwell, you have disobeyed a direct order. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Board the ship, you'll see that everything
I've been saying is true. 
PICARD: The Cardassian vessel will not be boarded. You will transport
yourself aboard the Enterprise 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Picard, if you don't board that ship, I'll
destroy it. 
PICARD: And I will use whatever force is necessary to prevent you from
taking that action, Captain. 
(transmission ends) 
O'BRIEN: Sir, Captain Maxwell, if he feels his back is to the wall,
he'll strike. 
DATA: Captain, the Phoenix is transferring power to its shields. 
WORF: They're arming phasers and loading forward torpedo bays. 
PICARD: Red alert. It seems you were right, Mister O'Brien. Ready
phasers, load torpedoes. 
WORF: Phasers armed. Loading forward and aft torpedo bays. 
O'BRIEN: Sir, let me beam over. Try to talk to him. We served together
a long time. When you've been through what we have, you tend to get
inside someone. He might listen. 
RIKER: He'd never drop his shields and allow you to transport on board.

O'BRIEN: The Phoenix is using a high energy sensor system. It cycles
every five point five minutes. Between cycles there's a window of a
fiftieth of a second. Trust me, I can get through. 
PICARD: Make it so.
