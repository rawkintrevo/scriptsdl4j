RIKER JAMESON PICARD TROI KARNAS GEORDI CRUSHER

[Transporter room]

(Jameson is in an enclosed wheelchair similar to
Captain Pike's, but with his upper torso free to move) 
PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. This is my Executive Officer,
Commander William Riker. 
RIKER: My pleasure, sir. Ma'am. 
JAMESON: My wife, Anne. Captain, there are certain details of this
mission that you should understand before we begin. 
PICARD: Yes, sir. 
JAMESON: I am not simply an advisor. On any assignment I accompany,
Starfleet has designated me Senior Mission Officer. I control the away
team and all its actions. Is that understood? Of course, Captain, you
command the ship, but the mission is mine. I trust you are in complete
agreement. 
PICARD: Yes, sir. Of course.

GEORDI: Message coming in from Mordan, sir. 
PICARD: Put it on the screen, Mister Data. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: Mordan Four to Enterprise. This is Karnas. I
will speak to the Captain. 
PICARD: I am Captain Picard, commanding the Enterprise. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: Is Admiral Jameson on board? 
PICARD: He's here, beside my First Officer. Do you wish to speak to him
now? 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: So, Jameson. I see time has not been kind. 
JAMESON: It seldom is, Karnas. However, we could save a good deal of it
now if you'll outline the terrorists' demands. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: They insist all discussions will take place
here on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me, only to a Federation
mediator. They say they will brook no excuses. If there are any
offered, your ambassador and his people will die. Unpleasantly. I
believe them. So should you, Admiral. 
JAMESON: Tell them I accept the conditions of negotiation. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: I will do so immediately. (transmission ends) 
RIKER: For a man in his position, he doesn't seem to know much about
the situation. 
JAMESON: Wrong, Number One. He told me that the terrorists are
desperate enough to kill if they're crossed. They are willing to talk,
one on one, but not to him. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: From his body language as well as his words and tone, I'd judge
that what Karnas said was honest. But I sensed a holding back. 
PICARD: Perhaps he knows more about the terrorists than he's prepared
to admit. 
JAMESON: Possible, but I suspect it's closer to the mark if we said he
doesn't want to admit failure of his own efforts to negotiate. He is a
proud man. 
TROI: That could be, sir. Karnas has established himself as a powerful
man on Mordan. Suddenly, in this situation, his power is useless. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge. I'm ready for Admiral Jameson now. 
PICARD: In a few moments, Doctor. 
JAMESON: Ready for what, Captain? 
PICARD: Just a routine medical checkup. Ship's regulations.
