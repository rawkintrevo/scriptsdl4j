[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: You wanted to see me, Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, Counsellor. Come, sit down. Counsellor, you've had the
opportunity to observe Doctor Pulaski for some time now. How would you
evaluate her as a Chief Medical Officer? 
TROI: I've never met a more dedicated physician. I would say she has a
passion for her work. 
PICARD: Yes, of course. I entirely agree. Is it possible that such
consuming dedication could interfere with her judgement? 
TROI: I feel your concern, Captain, but I don't share it. Perhaps
because I've had the opportunity to spend more time with her and get to
know her better. 
PICARD: Yes, perhaps you're right. 
DATA [OC]: Captain, we are picking up a faint distress signal on an
open subspace frequency. It appears to be coming from an adjacent
sector. 
PICARD: Respond on the same frequency. 
 [Bridge]

PICARD: Are you locked on to that transmission? 
DATA: Aye, sir. A voice only transmission from the USS Lantree, a
Federation supply ship. 
PICARD: USS Lantree, this is Picard of the Enterprise. What is the
nature of your emergency? 
VOICE [OC]: Can't hold out any more. People dying. Too many to help. 
DATA: We are still receiving their signal, Captain, but there is no
message.

PICARD: Lantree. Are you under attack? Lantree? USS Lantree, this is
the Enterprise. Come in, Lantree. Replay that last transmission. 
VOICE [OC]: Can't hold out any more. People dying. Too many to help. 
RIKER: Have we got a fix on her? 
DATA: Two point two milli-parsecs, bearing three zero at one four five
degrees. 
PICARD: Number One? 
RIKER: We'd better take a look. What kind of vessel is she? 
DATA: The Lantree is a Class Six Federation supply ship assigned to
Gamma seven sector, Captain L.I. Telaka commanding. Normal complement,
twenty six officers and crew. 
RIKER: Armed? 
DATA: Class three defensive only. 
RIKER: Is she still underway? 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Adjust course to intercept. Warp seven. 
WESLEY: Adjusting course to intercept. Warp seven, sir. 
(Geordi enters) 
LAFORGE: Engineering, transfer to Bridge. 
WESLEY: We are closing on the Lantree, Captain. 
PICARD: Take us out of warp. Establish parallel course. Match speed. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: Lantree, this is the Enterprise. Captain Telaka, this is Picard
of the Enterprise. Do you read me? 
DATA: No life signs, Captain. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: Nothing, Captain. 
RIKER: What else have we got in the neighbourhood? 
WESLEY: No other vessels of any kind within two parsecs. 
WORF: No battle damage. 
DATA: All systems seem functional, Captain. Everything is in perfect
order. 
WORF: We have to board her, Captain. 
PICARD: Possibly, Mister Worf. Number One? 
RIKER: If we gain control of her systems remotely, we could activate
the viewscreen. That way we could at least look at the Bridge. 
PICARD: Agreed.
