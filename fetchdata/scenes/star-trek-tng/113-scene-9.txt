sound their horns)

(The group cross the street to the news stand) 
VENDOR: Hey Dix. How's tricks? 
PICARD: Oh, she's fine, fine. 
WHALEN: He actually thinks you're Dixon Hill. 
PICARD: Say Mac, I would like to buy a newspaper too, but I don't have
any money. 
VENDOR: You catch me next time, Dix. 
PICARD: Thank you. (reads) Hitler on the move. Roosevelt presses

(Picard reads the inside headline - Wealthy Socialite Murdered. Police
have several leads in brutal slaying of Mrs. Arthur Clinton Bradley) 
PICARD: I should have listened to her. She told me someone was trying
to kill her. 
WHALEN: Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she ever was. 
BELL: Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. 
DATA: Cat? 
BELL: Where the hell did he come from? 
VENDOR: South America. Can't you tell? 
BELL: Wherever you're from, while you're in my town, keep your nose
clean. Well, tough guy, this time you've really done it. Your goose is
cooked but good. 
MCNARY: I'm sorry about this, Dix. 
BELL: Don't apologise to him. Where were you last night between ten and
midnight? 
PICARD: That would be a bit hard to explain. 
BELL: Yeah? Well you'll have plenty of time to come up with something.
You're going downtown. 
PICARD: What for? 
BELL: For the murder of Jessica Bradley. We found this in her purse.
