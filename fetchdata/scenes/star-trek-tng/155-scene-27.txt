RIKER LAFORGE WORF BOCHRA PICARD PATAHK CRUSHER DATA

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come. Worf. 
WORF: You are busy. Forgive my intrusion. 
RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. 
WORF: With respect, sir, you cannot. I am asked to give up the very
lifeblood of my mother and my father to those who murdered them. 
RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? 
WORF: Yes. 
RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with the
Romulans. 
WORF: Impossible. 
RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Think
how many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here now
like this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame?
Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carry
the bitterness on another generation? 
WORF: Then you believe I should? 
RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. 
WORF: My Starfleet training tells me one thing, but everything I am
tells me another. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. 
WORF: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end.
I thought it important for you to see him again. It's not too late to
change your mind. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PATAHK: Come close to me, Klingon. Let me die with my hands at your
throat. 
WORF: There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive. 
PATAHK: Then you've come to hear me beg for my life? 
WORF: No. 
PATAHK: I would rather die than pollute my body with Klingon filth!

[Cave]

BOCHRA: I've lost almost all feeling in my legs. 
LAFORGE: My synapses must be turning to jelly. The Visor's fine. I just
can't see a thing. 
BOCHRA: How do we locate the beacon? 
LAFORGE: We don't. 
BOCHRA: Do all humans give up so easily? 
LAFORGE: Bochra, we're lost, unless you've got something that can smell
neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: We have the sensor device you are carrying. 
LAFORGE: Tricorder? It's not set up to detect neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: Your eye device does. Connect them. 
LAFORGE: That's crazy. They don't speak the same language. Besides, I'd
never be able to get an accurate sampling. Wait a second. Wait, I
wouldn't need an
accurate sampling, just need a pointer. A neutrino Geiger counter. No,
it's still not possible. 
BOCHRA: You cannot do it? 
LAFORGE: Under normal circumstances, maybe. Here, no way. 
BOCHRA: Why? 
LAFORGE: Because I can't see. Adapting the neural output pods of the
Visor is tricky work. It can't be done by touch. 
BOCHRA: Then I will be your eyes.

[Bridge]

DATA: The storm is beginning to subside, Captain.
We should have a window in less than an hour. 
RIKER: There's still no indication that he's found the beacon, sir. 
PICARD: Assemble an away team. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
WORF: Captain, the Romulan warship has crossed the Neutral Zone border.
It is in Federation space and heading toward us. 
PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Make sure the scanner select limiter
matches the Visor output range. 
BOCHRA: Not so fast. 
LAFORGE: Now, place the neural output pods in contact with the
tricorder scanner heads. 
BOCHRA: Ready. 
LAFORGE: Let her rip. 
BOCHRA: Bearing three five zero. 
LAFORGE: We did it! The first Federation-Romulan co-venture. 
BOCHRA: The storm may be breaking. 
LAFORGE: With any luck, there'll be an electromagnetic window opening
up and we can get out of here. 
BOCHRA: At which point, I'll be your prisoner. 
LAFORGE: Can you walk? 
BOCHRA: I don't know. 
LAFORGE: Let's find out. Come on. (he hauls Bochra up) Okay, let's go. 
BOCHRA: Straight ahead. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
BOCHRA: To the right. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
WORF: You wished to see me, Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant. I assume you know what it's about. 
WORF: Yes. 
PICARD: The Romulan ship will reach us within the hour. If our patient
dies it may be just the excuse the Romulan commander needs to start an
incident. The death of a Romulan officer at the hands of the
Federation. Think of it. 
WORF: I have, Captain. 
PICARD: So, there is no question that the Romulan officer is more
valuable to us alive than dead. 
WORF: I understand. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, sometimes the moral obligations of command are less
than clear. I have to weigh the good of the many against the needs of
the individual, and try to balance them as realistically as possible.
God knows, I don't always succeed. 
WORF: I have not had cause to complain, Captain. 
PICARD: Oh, Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain even if you had cause. 
WORF: If you order me to agree to the transfusion, I will obey, of
course. 
PICARD: I don't want to order you. But I ask you. I beg you to
volunteer. 
WORF: I cannot. 
PICARD: Lieutenant. 
WORF: Sir? 
PICARD: That will be all. 
(Worf leaves) 
PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Go ahead. 
PICARD: Do not continue to enlist the cooperation of Lieutenant Worf. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I won't have to, Captain. The Romulan has died.
