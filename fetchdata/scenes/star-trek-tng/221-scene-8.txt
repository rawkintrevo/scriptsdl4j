[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: We may need to attempt a long range
transport. 
CREWWOMAN: Standing by. 
[Bridge]

(there's an explosion on the shuttle) 
PICARD: Energise. 
(KaBOOM)

[Transporter room]

OFFICER: Got them, sir. 
(one of whom - Lenor - is Max Grodenchik, practising to play Quark's
idiot brother, Rom)

[Bridge]

RIKER: Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests to
quarters. Not too close to mine. 
WORF: Understood.

[Corridor]

WORF: Unless you can arrange your own transport,
you will have to remain on the Enterprise until we complete our
mission. 
QOL: That will not be a problem. 
LENOR: We are in no hurry. 
QOL: We look forward to enjoying the comforts of your fine ship. 

[Ferengi quarters]

QOL: Quite acceptable. Not what we're used to, you
understand, but it will do. 
LENOR: Perhaps your captain would care to invite us to join him for
dinner this evening? 
WORF: The captain dines alone. 
(Worf leaves) 
QOL: A pity. That was too easy.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: We've been working from your drawings,
Ambassador. I hope we're in the ballpark. 
BRIAM: Ball park? 
PICARD: That's an old human expression. Mister LaForge hopes that we've
got close to achieving what you wanted. 
LAFORGE: Computer, run holodeck programme Krios One. 
COMPUTER: Enter when ready.
