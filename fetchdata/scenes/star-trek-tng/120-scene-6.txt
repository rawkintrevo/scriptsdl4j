TASHA PICARD LAFORGE

[Batris Corridor]

(Fallen girders, hanging wires, steam, and creaking
sounds) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge.

PICARD [OC]: This is the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm switching on the transmitter. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Ready to receive. Put this on main viewer. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
(A vision of weird coloured shapes, edges moving and blurring. As if
the viewer has been taking something highly illegal and mind-altering) 
PICARD: Extraordinary. Now I'm beginning to understand him. 
PICARD: Geordi. What was that? Over to the left. 
LAFORGE [OC]: What? 
PICARD: Yes, that. No, no, back. Yes, that. Right there. What is that? 
[Batris Corridor]

LAFORGE: That's Commander Riker. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Ah, to me it's just an undefined form,
standing in a visual frenzy. Can you filter out the extraneous
information? 
LAFORGE [OC]: No, I get it all simultaneously. 
PICARD: But it's just a jumble. 
[Batris Corridor]

PICARD [OC]: How can you make head or tail of it? 
LAFORGE: I select what I want and then disregard the rest. 
PICARD [OC]: But how is that possible? 
LAFORGE: Well, how, in a noisy room, can you select one specific voice
or sound? 
PICARD [OC]: Of course, something you learn. 
LAFORGE: Exactly.
