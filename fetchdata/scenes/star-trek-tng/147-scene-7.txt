LAFORGE:
So you're going
to beat him? 
RIKER:
Nope. 
LAFORGE: Well, then it's going to be a close one. 
RIKER: No. 
LAFORGE: But you have got a chance? 
RIKER: Nah. 
LAFORGE: Are you going to bother to show up? 
RIKER: Sure, Kolrami is the best ever at Strategema. Just to get to
play him is a privilege. 
LAFORGE: Other aside from your being privileged, is there anything else
I can look forward to? 
RIKER: Nope. 
LAFORGE: This is going to be exciting.


[Ten
Forward]

(Troi
putting the finger
controls on Kolrami, while Worf is Riker's second. They
are staring at each other
across a board which will project a
vertical game board)
PULASKI:
Against an opponent of approximate skill, Strategema can last
well over one thousand moves. 
LAFORGE: I wouldn't bet on us being here that long. 
WORF: I have wagered heavily in the ship's pool that you will take him
past the sixth plateau. 
RIKER: And if I don't? 
WORF: I will be irritated. 
DATA: Forever curious, this urge to compete. 
PULASKI: It's a human response. That inborn craving to gauge your
capabilities through conflict. 
DATA: Doctor, there are other ways to challenge oneself. 
PULASKI: Perhaps, but they all lack a certain thrill. 
TROI: Data, humans sometimes find it helpful to have an outsider set
the standard by which they're judged. 
DATA: To avoid deceiving oneself. 
PULASKI: Maybe you should challenge Kolrami to Strategema. 
DATA: Why, Doctor? 
PULASKI: Because when someone is that smug, you occasionally have to
deflate them just a little. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your neural flex tear him down a
peg. 
DATA: To what end? 
WORF: Computer. Actuation positions for Strategema. Ready? Begin. 
LAFORGE: Come on, Commander, come on now. 
TROI: Will. 
LAFORGE: You can do it. You can get him. Come on, Commander. Come on,
you got him, you got him, watch out. Here you go. 
(And the score at the top of the board reads - Riker 023, Kolrami 100) 
PULASKI: That's it? 
RIKER: I'm afraid so. 
PULASKI: But but you only made twenty-three moves. 
RIKER: Yes. Congratulations.
