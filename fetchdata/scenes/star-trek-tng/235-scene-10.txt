[Sickbay]

(Crusher is making repairs to her own right arm) 
WORF: Doctor, if you wish to master the bat'telh sword, you must learn
to strike and avoid in the same motion. 
CRUSHER: I almost got in under your guard, Worf. 
WORF: Almost. 
CRUSHER: Well, I'll keep that in mind next lesson. 
(Data enters) 
DATA: Doctor, are you injured? 
CRUSHER: Only my pride, Data. (to Worf) Thanks. 
(Worf leaves) 
DATA: Doctor, what is the definition of life? 
CRUSHER: (pause) That is a big question. Why do you ask? 
DATA: I am searching for a definition that will allow me to test an
hypothesis. 
[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Well, the broadest scientific definition
might be that life is what enables plants and animals to consume food,
derive energy from it, grow, adapt themselves to their surroundings and
reproduce. 
DATA: And you suggest that anything which exhibits these
characteristics is considered alive? 
CRUSHER: In general, yes. 
DATA: What about fire? 
CRUSHER: Fire? 
DATA: Yes. It consumes fuel to produce energy, it grows, it creates
offspring. By your definition, is it alive? 
CRUSHER: Fire is a chemical reaction. You could use the same argument
for growing crystals, but obviously we don't consider them alive. 
DATA: And what about me? I do not grow. I do not reproduce. I am
considered to be alive. 
CRUSHER: That's true, but you are unique. 
DATA: I wonder if that is so. 
CRUSHER: Data, if I may ask. Have a seat. What exactly are youe getting
at? 
DATA: I am curious as to what transpired between the moment when I was
nothing more than an assemblage of parts in Doctor Soong's laboratory,
and the next moment, when I became alive. What was it that endowed me
with life? 
CRUSHER: I remember Wesley asking me a similar question when he was
little, and I tried desperately to give him an answer, but everything I
said sounded inadequate. Then I realised that scientists and
philosophers had been grappling with that question for centuries
without coming to any conclusion. 
DATA: Are you saying the question cannot be answered? 
CRUSHER: No, I think I'm saying that we struggle all our lives to
answer it, but it's the struggle that's important. That's what helps us
to define our place in the universe. 
DATA: I believe I understand, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I don't think I've been very much help, Data. 
DATA: On the contrary, you have been a great deal of help. Thank you.
