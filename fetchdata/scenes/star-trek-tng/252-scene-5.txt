[Bridge]

(meanwhile, the Enterprise is under attack) 
PICARD: Evasive manoeuvres, Ensign! Return fire. 
LAFORGE: Shields down to eighty percent. Compensating with auxiliary
power.

[Outpost]

(one Borg goes hand-to-hand with Data, and is
knocked out. Riker manages to take down another) 
BOSUS: You have killed Torsus. I will make you suffer for this. 
TAYAR: Biological organism, Klingon. Biological organism, human. 
(A Borg kills Corelki, Worf kills him. Another Borg grabs Data by the
throat and Data does likewise, throttling him) 
DATA: (angry) Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
TAYAR: Artificial lifeform. Starfleet rank, Lieutenant Commander. Name,
Data. 
(the Borg are beamed away and their ship starts to leave)

LAFORGE: Captain, the alien ship is breaking orbit.

PICARD: Plot an intercept course, Ensign. Fire torpedoes. 
(but they go to warp just before the torpedoes arrive) 
LAFORGE: They're gone, sir. Our sensors indicate there was some kind of
subspace distortion just before they disappeared. I'll have to study
these readings before I can get more specific than that. 
PICARD: Take us back to Ohniaka Three. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.
