[Engineer's office]

WESLEY: He could have been working there, restoring
warp power. 
LAFORGE: According to these readings, we could go back to warp speed
now. 
WESLEY: Those aren't the same readings as when I left. 
WORF: Singh probably repaired it just before he was killed. 
WESLEY: He couldn't have repaired, sir. The problems were inside the
engine. 
LAFORGE: Who else could have corrected it, Wes? Inform the bridge of
engine status. 
WORF: Engineering to Bridge. We now have warp capacity, sir. All power
on line.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Well done. Warp engines ready on previous
heading. Warp factor six.

[Antican quarters]

ANTICAN: I tolerate these questions, Lieutenant
Yar, because I need this vessel to get us to Parliament. Your shipboard
problems do not concern me. 
TASHA: They should. Our delays are your delays. 
ANTICAN: The peace conference will wait for us. 
TASHA: I must ask where you were during this vessel's Earth hours of
eighteen hundred last night and zero seven hundred this morning. 
ANTICAN: Eating. 
TASHA: Sir, we're talking about hours here. 
ANTICAN: It was a large meal, Lieutenant Yar. And a very interesting
animal.

[Crusher's office]

WORF: You wanted me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes, concerning your memory blackout. 
WORF: I still don't remember having one. 
CRUSHER: The same thing happened to me. 
TROI: I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memory
as to what happened.
