[Hilltop]

(A flat area with the top of the mountain forming a
back wall. It's windy and desolate.)
SCHOLAR: Yes, this will do. It is important that we set this up
properly. Commander. If it be possible, I would like torches here and
here. 
RIKER: Engineering. 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: This is the away team. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: We are going to need your help. 
LAFORGE: I thought you might.

[Hilltop]

RIKER: We would like two torches. Head high? (Riva
nods) And what else? 
SCHOLAR: A table here. 
RIKER: Describe it. 
SCHOLAR: Three sided, and if possible made to resemble indigenous rock.

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Did you read that, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I did. That should be no problem.

[Hilltop]

RIKER: When will the emissaries arrive? 
SCHOLAR: It shouldn't be too long. 
RIKER: And how long do you think the negotiations will take? 
SCHOLAR: They won't go quickly. 
WORF: They're coming, Commander. 
SCHOLAR: The first few minutes will be very tense. Please stay calm,
and do not respond even if you are provoked. 
RIKER: We'll do our best. 
(The first pair enter) 
ALIEN 1: Who is Riva? 
WOMAN: I am Riva. 
(The other faction enters.) 
WOMAN: Be at ease. I commend you both. To come here proves not only
your courage, but your wisdom. Please, give this conference a chance. 
SCHOLAR: I have no magic. You have been fighting all your lives. You
know only 
(The second faction's guard interrupts him) 
ALIEN 3: No, no, never! Death first! 
RIKER: Riva! 
(Riker gets Riva out of the line of fire, but the Chorus are
vapourised) 
ALIEN 2: Don't! Traitor! 
(And he kills the assassin himself. The first faction draw their
weapons) 
ALIEN 2: No, wait. Wait. 
RIKER: Away team to Enterprise. Beam us up. Now! 
ALIEN 2: His words are not mine. Please, Riva. 
(But Riker, Worf and Riva are beamed away) 
ALIEN 2: We need you. We need you! 
[Observation lounge]

(Riva is gesturing angrily to Troi and Data as
Picard enters) 
PICARD: How did this happen? 
RIKER: A total surprise. Apparently a member of one of the factions
didn't like the idea of peace. 
PICARD: I don't understand what you're trying to say. Counsellor? 
TROI: Riva, go slowly. Slowly. 
PICARD: Can you write it out? I am so sorry that your friends were
killed. I'm sorry, I don't know what you are trying to tell me. We have
to find some way to communicate with him. Data, he knows some kind of
gestural language. Find our which one and learn it. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Counsellor, take him to Sickbay. Maybe Pulaski can help. (grabs
Riva's head) Listen to me. You are not alone. Do you understand? We are
all in this together now. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We are monitoring
increased military activity on Solais Five. I fear that without Riva,
we will be unable to keep the Solari from destroying themselves.
