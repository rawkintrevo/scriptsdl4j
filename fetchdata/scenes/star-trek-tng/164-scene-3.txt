[Corridor]

PICARD: I insist we do whatever we can to
discourage the perception of this new android as a child. It is not a
child. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one. 
TROI: Why should biology rather than technology determine whether it is
a child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his own
being. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal his
child, then who are we to argue? 
PICARD: Well, if he must, but I fail to understand how a five foot
android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten men
can be called a child. 
TROI: You've never been a parent.

[Ready room]

PICARD: What you have done will have serious
ramifications. I am truly dismayed that you told
no one of what you were doing. 
DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I did not anticipate your objections. Do you
wish me to deactivate Lal? 
PICARD: It's a life, Data. It can't be activated and deactivated
simply. This is a most stupendous undertaking. Have you any idea what
will happen when Starfleet learns about this? 
DATA: I have followed all of Starfleet regulations to the best of my
ability. I expected they would be pleased. 
PICARD: Well, you have taken on quite a responsibility, Data. 
DATA: To prepare, I have scanned all available literature on parenting.
There seems to be much confusion on this issue. One traditional
doctrine insists, spare the rod and spoil the child, suggesting a
punitive approach. While another more liberal
attitude would allow the child enormous freedom. 
PICARD: Data 
DATA: And what Klingons do to their children 
PICARD: Data! I'm not talking about parenting. I am talking about the
extraordinary consequences of creating new life. 
DATA: Does that not describe becoming a parent, sir? 
PICARD: Data, you are seeking to achieve what only your own creator has
been able to achieve. To make another functioning, sentient, android.
To make another Data. 
DATA: That is why I must attempt this, sir. I have observed that in
most species, there is a primal instinct to perpetuate themselves.
Until now, I have been the last of my kind. If I were to be damaged or
destroyed, I would be lost forever. But if I am successful
with the creation of Lal, my continuance is assured. I understand the
risk, sir. and I am prepared to accept the responsibility.
