WESLEY TROI DATA LAFORGE PICARD

[Laboratory]

DATA: Lal has a positronic brain one very similar
to my own. I began programming it at the cybernetics conference. 
LAFORGE: But nobody's ever been able to do that, Data, at least not
since you were programmed. 
DATA: True, but here was a new submicron matrix transfer technology
introduced at the conference which I discovered could be used to lay
down complex neural net pathways. 
WESLEY: So you did a transfer from your brain into Lal's. 
DATA: Exactly, Wesley. I realised for the first time it was possible to
continue Doctor Soong's work. My initial transfers produced very
encouraging results, so I brought Lal's brain back with me. 
PICARD: Data, I would like to have been consulted. 
DATA: I have not observed anyone else on board consulting you about
their procreation, Captain. 
TROI: Why didn't you give it a more human look, Data? 
DATA: I decided to allow my child to choose its own sex and appearance.

PICARD: Commander Data, at your convenience, I would like to talk to
you in my Ready room. Counsellor?

PICARD: I insist we do whatever we can to
discourage the perception of this new android as a child. It is not a
child. It is an invention, albeit an extraordinary one. 
TROI: Why should biology rather than technology determine whether it is
a child? Data has created an offspring. A new life out of his own
being. To me, that suggests a child. If he wishes to call Lal his
child, then who are we to argue? 
PICARD: Well, if he must, but I fail to understand how a five foot
android with heuristic learning systems and the strength of a ten men
can be called a child. 
TROI: You've never been a parent.
