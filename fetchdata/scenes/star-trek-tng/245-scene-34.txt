PICARD: Picard to Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: I want a signal lock on every member of the perimeter teams. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, the storm's interference won't 
PICARD: As soon as the last of the colony is evacuated, I want those
perimeter teams out of there. Is that understood? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, sir.

(the people look a mess, dirty and sweaty) 
NELLA: Daren to perimeter teams. The storm's interference is going to
make our job harder than we thought. We may lose
communication, so it's up to each of you to keep your units
operational. A lot of people are depending on us. Daren out. 
(she peeks up over the ridge) 
NELLA: Oh, my god.

WORF: The storm has reached the perimeter.

[Sickbay]

RIKER: I got out with the last of the colonists. If
it hadn't been for the perimeter teams, none of us would have made it.
We were able to clear out four of the teams, and the interference
prevented us from getting two more. I don't know how they could have
survived. 
PICARD: Which teams are missing? 
RIKER: Three and six. 
RIKER: The last I knew, Commander Daren was on team six.

WORF [OC]: Bridge to Captain. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Mister Worf. 
WORF [OC]: We have found survivors, sir. They are beaming up now. 
PICARD: I'm on my way.
