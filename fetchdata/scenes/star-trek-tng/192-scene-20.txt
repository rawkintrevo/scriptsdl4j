RIKER PICARD COMPUTER OGAWA CRUSHER DATA

[Sickbay]

(Susanna is completely unrecognisable now) 
CRUSHER: There, in the thymus. Some sort of parasite. It's using
Susanna's immune system to spread genetic instructions. 
OGAWA: How did it get there? 
CRUSHER: She could have become infected during the original mission.
It's small enough to have entered through any of the mucous membranes.
But it certainly isn't behaving like a typical parasite. It isn't
feeding off of her. It's transforming her DNA to match its own. 
OGAWA: There's not much of her original DNA left. 
CRUSHER: And we're going to need unaltered genes or we'll never get her
back. We've got to get that thing out of her now.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Any luck? 
DATA: Negative, Commander. Nothing in our survey suggests the source of
a parasitic infection. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Bridge. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: The surgery was successful 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: But it's going to be a few more hours
before we know how her regenerative systems are responding. In the
meantime, we'd better get Commander La Forge down here. 
PICARD [OC]: Very well, Doctor, keep us informed. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to La Forge. Computer, locate Commander La Forge. 
COMPUTER: Commander La Forge is not on board the Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: Bridge, the Computer says Commander La Forge is no longer on
board. Is that correct?
