protect tokor late attackers goodbye coming home displaying tomorrow

[Maranga Outpost]

(night, and Worf is waiting for Alexander, who
comes running) 
ALEXANDER: Father. 
WORF: Where have you been? 
ALEXANDER: We were watching the fire dancers. 
WORF: We? 
ALEXANDER: K'Nor and Bar'el. They live here on the outpost. I need some
money. 
WORF: What for? 
ALEXANDER: The man over there says he's got Molor's head in a box. The
real Molor. 
WORF: That is impossible. The real Molor died centuries ago. 
ALEXANDER: I know. It's mummified. He offered to show us for fifty
darseks. 
WORF: He is trying to take your money. 
ALEXANDER: Please, Father. He's waiting. 
WORF: No. It is late. We should go home. 
ALEXANDER: But 
(they are watched by a mysterious stranger) 
WORF: Alexander, that is enough. Come, it is time to go. 
ALEXANDER: I have to say goodbye to my friends. 
WORF: You can see your friends again tomorrow. 
ALEXANDER: We're coming back? 
WORF: If you want to. 
(three Klingons surround them and draw their daggers) 
ROBBER: Hi'jak beh. 
(the mysterious stranger fires a disrupter and startles the attackers) 
WORF: Run, Alexander. 
(Worf takes on the three robbers, and the stranger only intervenes to
stop one getting knife to stab him in the back) 
K'MTAR: Ni'tokor bak'to! 
(the robbers run off) 
K'MTAR: Q'apla, Worf. You are too much for them. 
WORF: I have seen you before. Who are you? 
K'MTAR: A friend. 
(he holds out his fist, displaying a ring) 
WORF: Are you K'mtar. 
K'MTAR: Your brother sent me here to protect you.
