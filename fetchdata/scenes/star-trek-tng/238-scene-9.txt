DATA: Set the pattern enhancers around whatever
object you wish to transport. I will proceed to the transporter room
and begin modifications. 
BARCLAY: Computer, run Sherlock Holmes Programme three A. 
COMPUTER: That programme is already in use.

[221b Baker Street]

(the lovely Stephanie Beacham greets Reg) 
GUEST1: Are you here to see Mister Holmes, or perhaps Professor
Moriarty? Neither is in just now. 
BARCLAY: Um, er, no. No, no. I'm not here to see anyone. I'm just here
to deliver these. 
GUEST1: Fine. Just put them anywhere. 
BARCLAY: Actually, I have to put them right here. 
GUEST1: How curious. Why is that? 
BARCLAY: Well, it has to do with, er, it's nothing you need to worry
about, Countess. 
GUEST1: Are you suggesting that it's beyond my comprehension? 
BARCLAY: It's really very simple. I need to enhance the molecular
pattern of this chair so that the transporter can get a better lock on
the signal. 
GUEST1: This has to do with taking James and me into the real world. 
BARCLAY: You, you, you know about that? You understand about the real
world? 
GUEST1: James has explained it to me. It sounds like a grand
adventure. There's nothing I love more than voyaging in the unknown.
Have you ever been to Africa, Mister? 
BARCLAY: Er, Barclay. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay. No, no, I haven't. 
GUEST1: I have. When I was seventeen I went on safari with my uncle.
My mother took to her bed in terror I'd be bitten by tsetse fly, but I
had a marvellous time. I got to wear trousers the whole time. It was
hard to go back to a corset, I can tell you. 
BARCLAY: Yes, I'm sure it was. 
GUEST1: After that, I never stopped travelling. I couldn't bear to be
stuck in one place for very long. So you see I'm so looking forward to
this new experience. My. Travelling the stars. 
BARCLAY: You know about that? You know where we are? Countess, forgive
me, but you just don't sound like a holodeck character. 
MORIARTY: That's because she isn't. 
GUEST1: James! 
(Moriarty and the Countess kiss passionately) 
MORIARTY: If you loved a woman like this, Lieutenant, would you be
content to let her remain a simulation? 
BARCLAY: You, you gave her consciousness? 
MORIARTY: Yes, just as it was given to me. 
BARCLAY: Well I'm not so sure that's a good idea. 
MORIARTY: Nonsense. It was the only thing to do. 
BARCLAY: Have you tried to take her off the holodeck yet? 
MORIARTY: No. I am unwilling to risk the Countess' safety. I want to
make sure nothing will happen to her. 
GUEST1: We may be closer to freedom than you think, James. These
devices will enhance our molecular patterns. They'll help take us into
the real world. 
MORIARTY: Oh, please, proceed. 
BARCLAY: Well, we're going to try to transport this chair off the
holodeck first. We didn't want to try it on the Countess until we were
sure it would work. 
GUEST1: How thoughtful. Isn't he thoughtful, James? 
BARCLAY: Barclay to Commander Data.
