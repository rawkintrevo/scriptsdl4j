[Past - Bridge]

DATA: Anti-time, sir?
PICARD: I believe that if you modify the deflectors to send out an
inverse tachyon pulse, then you'll find that the anomaly is a rupture
between time and anti-time. 
DATA: That is a fascinating hypothesis. How did you formulate 
PICARD: I don't have time to discuss it now, Mister Data. Do the
modifications and send out the pulse. Then try working on a theory as
to what caused this rupture. Mister O'Brien, how large is this anomaly?

O'BRIEN: Approximately four hundred million kilometres in diameter,
sir. 
PICARD: I don't understand why it's bigger in the past. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, you have the Bridge. I'll be in my Ready room. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

PICARD: What's going on? 
CRUSHER: We're under attack. 
GUEST2: Shield strength down to fifty two percent. Minor damage to the
port nacelle. 
WORF: Two Klingon attack cruisers decloaking to port and starboard. 
CRUSHER: Warp speed. Get us out of here. 
GUEST2: Warp power's offline, sir. 
CRUSHER: Heading one four eight, mark two one five. Full impulse. 
GUEST2: Impulse power's fluctuating. Shields down to thirty percent. 
PICARD: Weapons status? 
WORF: These weapons are no match for their shields. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, we need more warp power, now. 
LAFORGE: I'm trying, Captain. They're too much for us. I can't keep the
phase inducers online. 
GUEST2: Shields down to nine percent. One more hit and they'll
collapse. 
CRUSHER: Open a channel. 
GUEST2: Open. 
CRUSHER: This is Captain Beverly Picard. We are a medical ship on a
mission of mercy. Please break off all (Bang) Worf, signal our
surrender. 
WORF: Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh! 
(but they fire again, and Chilton is killed) 
WORF: Our shields have collapsed. We are defenceless. 
DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three
one oh. It's the Enterprise. 
(a three-nacelled Enterprise) 
DATA: They're hailing us. 
CRUSHER: On screen. 
RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by.
I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. 
(Enterprise phasers slice through the Klingon shields and ships.
KaBOOM!) 
WORF: The Enterprise is drawing their fire. 
CRUSHER: Damage report. 
LAFORGE: The warp core has been badly damaged. There's a breach in
progress. 
PICARD: We have to stop it! 
DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. 
RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in
progress. Prepare for emergency beam out.
