RIKER LAFORGE WORF KYLE PULASKI WESLEY DATA

[Engineering]

DATA: And it has nothing to do with Commander
Riker's new assignment? 
WESLEY: No. His reaction was just the opposite of mine. Completely
unaffected. 
LAFORGE: You see? With all that's going on, maybe you're overreacting. 
WESLEY: Really? You try talking to Worf, Geordi. I'm telling you, he is
not normal for Worf. 
DATA: There is, of course, a genetic predisposition toward hostility
among all Klingons, but Worf has been unusually out of sorts. 
LAFORGE: Come on, he's never been much on charm. 
WESLEY: Well, whatever is troubling him, I think we should try to help.
He is our friend. 
LAFORGE: I for one want to keep him friendly. 
WESLEY: Suggestions? 
DATA: Empirical study. Monitor the subject. 
WESLEY: Right. Watch the subject for any signs of unusual behaviour. 
LAFORGE: That won't be difficult. 
DATA: Within the norm of Klingon patterns, of course. Discretion will
be required. 
WESLEY: Agreed. When do we start? 
LAFORGE: We will assist you as needed. You found the problem. 
DATA: And you must solve it.

[Ten Forward]

(Fresh drinks are brought to Kyle and Kate, and
Riker finally can't stand it. He goes over) 
KYLE: Thank you. And after working out the Fuurinkazan battle
strategies at the Tokyo Base, I was asked to come here to work for
Starfleet as a tactical advisor. 
PULASKI: I'm surprised you stayed our of the action as long as you did.
Will, please join us. Your father and I are just catching up. 
RIKER: You never told me you knew him. 
PULASKI: Well, it wasn't exactly a secret. It just never really came
up. 
KYLE: Sit down, son. 
RIKER: I'm ready for that briefing whenever you are. 
(Riker stalks out. A little later, Data and Geordi enter) 
KYLE: Good to see you too, Graham. 
PULASKI: You wouldn't be running for mayor, would you? 
KYLE: Do pick up work for the Federation long enough and it'll happen
to you, too. I thought about you a lot. 
PULASKI: Kyle, I don't need to hear what you don't need to say. 
KYLE: We could've been great together. 
PULASKI: Possibly. 
KYLE: Is it true you got married? 
PULASKI: Again and again. 
KYLE: That make you three for three, doesn't it? 
PULASKI: I'm not complaining. Each was good a man and we're all still
good friends. 
KYLE: Like us? 
PULASKI: Close, but different. They were all a little more in touch
with themselves. 
KYLE: Ouch. 
PULASKI: Face facts, Kyle. You're crusty. You have a reputation for
being hard as nails and getting the job done. Underneath it all, you're
not so bad. Some of us even love you. And then there's Will. 
KYLE: Then there's Will. 
(Worf is standing staring out of the window) 
LAFORGE: Wesley should really be doing this on his own. 
DATA: But he needs his study time. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe you fell for that. I don't know, Data. He
looks perfectly normal to me. 
DATA: In solitude, there is nothing to trigger unusual behaviour. 
LAFORGE: Good point. Let's not tamper with the status quo. 
DATA: But that would defeat the opportunity for our behavioural
research. In all probability, he is simply lonely. We can relieve his
anxiety through socialisation. 
LAFORGE: Be my guest. 
(Data goes over to Worf) 
DATA: Excuse me, Lieutenant. You seem to have lost the will to
communicate with others. You have friends here. We, we care about you.
Why, just recently, Geordi, Wesley and I were saying 
WORF: With all due respect, be gone! Sir. 
(The blast jolts Data backwards. He returns to Geordi) 
DATA: He seems quite sincere in his desire for solitude. 
LAFORGE: Seeing is believing, huh?
