KORRIS RIKER WORF PICARD KONMEL NURSE CRUSHER

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: We are taking the survivors to Sickbay.

PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. 
WORF: Captain. Request permission to join you. 
PICARD: Granted.

[Sickbay]

WORF: Debris is still being analysed. 
PICARD: Inform me as soon as it is complete. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Situation, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: His injuries are very critical. 
PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard, Captain of this vessel. 
KORRIS: My name is Korris, Captain of the Klingon Defence Force. This
is Lieutenant Konmel. 
PICARD: Would you mind telling me what has happened? 
KORRIS: We were passengers. The Talarians were taking us to outpost M
Zed Five. 
PICARD: What was the ship doing in the Neutral Zone? 
KORRIS: We were attacked without warning by a Ferengi cruiser. During
the course of the battle we must have unknowingly entered the Neutral
Zone. 
WORF: The weapons were not Ferengi. 
KORRIS: What is your name? 
WORF: I am Lieutenant Worf. 
KORRIS: And you are a member of this crew? 
WORF: Yes. 
KORRIS: You are correct. The weapons were Klingon, but the vessel was
Ferengi. 
PICARD: What precipitated the attack? 
KORRIS: I don't know. We were in our quarters. 
KONMEL: The captain of the freighter had no combat experience so he did
not anticipate the first attack, which was nearly fatal. 
KORRIS: We took control with his permission. The Ferengi called for
surrender. I told the Captain to agree to all their terms. We had only
one chance, but I was confident it would be enough. 
KONMEL: As adversaries the Ferengi are not very worthy. 
WORF: Still, your weapons were limited and their ship superior. 
KORRIS: Yes. All we had was an ancient battery of Merculite rockets.
Our only chance was to trick them into lowering their shields. 
KONMEL: We reduced power and lured them in. 
KORRIS: They suspected nothing. 
KONMEL: Then, when they lowered their shields to beam over a boarding
party, we opened fire. 
PICARD: Still, there are some points that I'm not very clear about. 
KORRIS: Captain, we are hungry and tired. 
PICARD: Of course. 
KORRIS: If there is anything else you wish to know about this incident,
we will be available. 
WORF: Permission to show our guests to their quarters, Captain. 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
(Worf, Korris and Konmel leave) 
RIKER: What do you think, Captain? 
PICARD: There's more to this than we've been told. Why was the Talarian
ship so far off course? What was its point of departure? 
RIKER: Why would three Klingon officers hitch a ride on a broken down
freighter? 
PICARD: Contact Starfleet. Find out what they know about Korris and
company. 
RIKER: It'll take forty eight hours for a message to get to Starfleet
on subspace frequency. 
PICARD: They're going to be with us for a while. Let's find out all we
can about them. 
RIKER: Do you think I should have assigned a security team to keep an
eye on our guests? 
PICARD: No. Worf can deal with anything that might arise. How's your
patient, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Not good. I'll keep you posted.

[Guest Quarters]

KORRIS: Sit, friend. Let us eat. 
KONMEL: (to replicator) O'Mat gri tea and piviots. (a tray with a
bottle and food arrives) 
KORRIS: I did not know there were Klingons serving on human Starfleet
vessels. 
WORF: As far as I know, I am the only one. 
KORRIS: Tell me, what it is like for the hunter to lie down with the
prey? Have they tamed you, or have you always been docile? 
KONMEL: Does it make you gentle? Has it filled your heart with peace? 
KORRIS: Do glorious battles no longer inspire your dreams? 
WORF: Why do you mock me? Why do you wish to anger me? 
KORRIS: Only to see if it is still possible. 
WORF: It is.

[Sickbay]

NURSE: Doctor! I think you'd better come and look
at this. The Klingon's condition is worsening. 
CRUSHER: He's convulsing. Get the hypospray. 
[Guest Quarters]

(The guests are finishing their meal) 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Korris, this is Captain Picard. 
KORRIS: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: I am sorry to report your comrade's injuries are beyond
our medical abilities.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He's dying. 
(Korris, Konmel and Worf stand over the bed. As the young man breaths
his last, Korris holds his eyelids open. Then they all start a deep
throaty growl, which becomes a roar as they are sure he is dead. Konmel
removes a hook from the boot) 
CRUSHER: Is there any special arrangement you would like for the body? 
KORRIS: It is only an empty shell now. Please treat it as such.

[Corridor]

KONMEL: The opponent that killed Kunivas should
have been an enemy, then his death would have been even more glorious. 
WORF: If the opponent was not an enemy, who was it? Tell me. What
really happened? 
KORRIS: I do not wish to anger you. We are after all, brothers lost
among infidels. Tell me, how is it that you come to this ship, that
uniform? 
WORF: Through an act of kindness. The Romulans attacked the Khitomer
outpost. Everyone was killed. I was buried under the rubble and left
for dead. A human Starfleet officer found me. He took me to his home on
Gault and told his wife to raise me as his son. 
KONMEL: How old were you? 
WORF: Before the age of inclusion. 
KONMEL: That young? 
KORRIS: Gault is a farming colony.
