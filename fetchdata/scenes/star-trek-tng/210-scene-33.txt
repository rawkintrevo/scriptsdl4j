(there are pockets of fire everywhere) 
WORF: Alexander! 
RIKER: Alexander, can you hear me? Alexander? 
[Bridge]

kilometres, Captain. 
PICARD: Stand by to fire torpedoes on my command.

[Biolab]

RIKER: Alexander! 
WORF: Commander, I've found him! 
(he is pinned under the remains of something) 
RIKER: Worf! Where are you Worf? 
WORF: Over here. Help me. 
(they try to lift the debris) 
RIKER: It's too heavy. I've got to find something to help us. 
ALEXANDER: Father? 
WORF: Lie still, I am here. 
ALEXANDER: My leg hurts. I'm scared. 
(with a massive paternal adrenalin rush, Worf moves the debris just as
Riker returns with a lever. Worf takes Alexander in his arms) 
ALEXANDER: The gilvos! 
RIKER: There's no time. 
ALEXANDER: Please, they'll die!
