RIKER: But they beamed over their cargo. 
PICARD: Cargo? Are those people crazy? What could possibly be so
important? 
WORF: Sir, the freighter is disintegrating. 
PICARD: Their lives are in danger and they're beaming over cargo?
Number One, I don't understand these people. 
LAFORGE: Captain, the freighter's hull temperature is approaching
critical.

RIKER: Unbelievable. 
PICARD [OC]: We're losing the freighter. Got to beam those people over
now. 
RIKER: Clear the cargo. Beam it to a hold. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise, Get to your
transporter pad and. No, forget about that. Lock on to any life form
you can find and get them over now.

TASHA: Reading six life forms, but I can't get a
solid lock. 
RIKER: We have no choice. Energise. I thought you said there were six.
Where are the other two? 
TASHA: The lock didn't hold. 
RIKER: Re-establish. 
TASHA: It's too late.
