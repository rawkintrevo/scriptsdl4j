[Brekkian Guest quarters]

GUEST2: We have thought about this a great deal. 
GUEST4: We both of us feel deeply about what is happening on Ornara. 
GUEST2: Although it is going to cause hardship to us and to our people,
we have decided to give the felicium to them. 
GUEST4: They can pay whenever they are able. 
GUEST2: We don't want to be the ones responsible for their suffering. 
PICARD: There goes the other shoe. They know. 
CRUSHER: What do they know? 
PICARD: They know that the Ornarans no longer have the plague. They
know that felicium is no longer a medicine. So, of course, they are
willing to give this shipment because they don't want to take the
chance that the Ornarans will lose their addiction. They don't want to
lose their only customers. 
CRUSHER: How would they have known all that, unless the plague had once
infected their world as well. 
PICARD: They were infected. They used the felicium to cure themselves,
but somehow their ancestors realised that it was a narcotic. 
CRUSHER: They broke the cycle of addiction and never told the Ornarans.
They let them continue to believe that without the felicium they would
die. 
PICARD: I think it's worse than that. My guess is this refining process
of which you are so proud 
CRUSHER: is only to increase the potency of the felicium and tighten
your grip! 
GUEST4: What are you going to do? 
GUEST2: Are you going to tell them? 
PICARD: No. I'm bound by the rules of the United Federation of Planets,
which order me not to interfere with other worlds, other cultures. If I
were to tell them any of this, I would violate that Prime Directive. 
GUEST4: But you are talking to us about it. 
PICARD: This is information you already know. And so nothing has
changed. 
GUEST2: If you can't interfere, then you are going to allow the
Ornarans to have the felicium? 
PICARD: Yes, I am. 
CRUSHER: No! Don't do it. Jean-Luc, this is not a symbiotic
relationship. This is exploitation, pure and simple! The Brekkians have
caused all of this suffering and hardship only to make their pitiful
lives easier! And all of it based on a lie. No, deny them this
shipment. It is the least we can do. 
PICARD: From the moment they agreed to give them the felicium, my hands
were tied. 
GUEST2: You are absolutely right, Captain. It's not your business.
