DATA: Ambassador Odan, Doctor Crusher. I was just on my way to speak to
you. 
CRUSHER: Hello, Data. 
DATA: I have completed my study on the atmospheric variations which
have occurred on the moon since the new technology was implemented. 
ODAN: Thank you, Commander. That will be most helpful in my efforts to
mediate the quarrel. 
DATA: I could go over it with you now. It would not require more than
two hours. 
CRUSHER: We do appreciate that, Data, but the Ambassador and I have set
aside this time to analyse the incidence of the lung disease on the
moon's inhabitants. 
DATA: Then it is perfect timing, Doctor. What better occasion to
integrate my results into your study? 
ODAN: Now that I think about it, you're absolutely right, Commander.
Unfortunately, I'm not feeling very well. Perhaps Doctor Crusher could
get you started inputting your information. I myself must return to my
quarters. 
CRUSHER: Ambassador, are you still having those awful headaches? I'd
better bring you a hypospray to take care of it. 
ODAN: I would be most grateful. 
CRUSHER: Okay.
