[Holodeck]

(Data puts Juliana's chip into a holder, then into
the holodeck arch panel) 
GUEST1: Whoever you are, you must have found out about Juliana. 
DATA: That is correct. 
GUEST1: I programmed this hologram to answer any questions you might
have. I am Noonian Soong. I created her. 
DATA: I am Data. 
GUEST1: Data? I hoped somehow it might be you. I even created a response
programme to answer your questions. How are you, boy? 
DATA: I am fine. 
GUEST1: I'm glad you got the chance to meet your mother. 
DATA: You refer to Doctor Tainer as my mother, yet the complexity of
her design indicates she was created after I was. 
GUEST1: You're right. But there was a real Juliana O'Donnell. She was my
wife. She helped me create you. 
DATA: What happened to her? 
GUEST1: She was injured when the Crystalline Entity attacked. We made it
as far as Terlina Three but, she slipped into a coma. When I realised
nothing could be done for her, I built an android. I tried to perfect
my synaptic scanning technique so that I could transfer Juliana's
memories into a positronic matrix. I didn't know if it would work, but
I had to try. I couldn't stand the thought of losing the only woman I
ever loved. A few days after Juliana died, I activated the android. She
looked up at me and smiled. She recognised me. It had worked! Here was
a life not two minutes old, and as far as she knew I was her husband.
She'd just recovered from a terrible injury. It was incredible. 
DATA: Then you never told her the truth? 
GUEST1: Why? There was no reason for her to know. I wanted her to be
happy. I wanted us to be happy. We were. For a while. 
DATA: What happened? 
GUEST1: I made a terrible mistake. I never really let her know how much
I loved her. So she left me. The real Juliana probably would have left
too, if she'd lived. 
DATA: If she recovers and learns that she is an android 
GUEST1: She doesn't have to know. I designed her to shut down in the
event the truth was discovered. When you put that chip back in, she
will wake up and remember nothing. All you have to do is make up some
excuse about what happened to her. 
DATA: Then you do not believe she should know the truth? 
GUEST1: Truth? The truth is, in every way that matters, she is Juliana
Soong. I programmed her to terminate after a long life. Let her live
out her days, and die believing she was human. Don't rob her of that,
son. Please.
