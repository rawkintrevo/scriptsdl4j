COMPUTER CRUSHER WORF

[Corridor]

(Beverly rings the doorbell twice, then taps in an
override code) 

[Quaice's quarters]

CRUSHER: Dalen? Dalen, it's Beverly. 
(The suite is empty) 
CRUSHER: Computer, current location of Doctor Dalen Quaice. 
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. 
(A little later, after the opening titles, the doorbell chimes) 
CRUSHER: Come. 
(Worf enters) 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before we left starbase, an old
friend of mine came onboard. Doctor Dalen Quaice. I requested quarters
for him. He was assigned here. 
WORF: I was not aware of this passenger. 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. I thought it was standard procedure for you to be
notified after Captain Picard approved passage. 
WORF: It is. Please proceed. 
CRUSHER: We were to meet for breakfast, but I can't seem to find him or
his belongings. 
WORF: Computer, where is Doctor Dalen Quaice? 
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very old and rather frail. If he
fell somewhere, if his communicator were damaged. 
WORF: I will order a search immediately. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. 
WORF: Even if Doctor Quaice had been injured, why would his belongings
be missing?
