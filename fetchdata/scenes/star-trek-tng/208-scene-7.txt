CRUSHER: They're not removable, are they, Data?
DATA: Removable?
CRUSHER: Your ears.
DATA: No, Doctor. They are fully integrated components.
CRUSHER: We'll have to do some moulds of his ears as well.
PICARD: What about his skin colour?
CRUSHER: We'll have to do some tests on his skin pigmentation. Changing
it to appear Romulan shouldn't be too difficult. We just have to make
sure we can change it back again afterwards. Your right eye is point
zero zero four higher than your left.

PICARD: Nobody's perfect, Doctor, but
CRUSHER: If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor.
PICARD: Anything from Gowron?
RIKER: No, sir. But after your tailor is done, would you join me in the
cargo bay? Mister La Forge has made some progress with the metal
fragments.
CRUSHER: These two still have an appointment with Mister Mott to have
their hairpieces designed.
PICARD: Thirty minutes, Number One.

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: What we seem to have here is a
navigational deflector array. Or at least what's left of one.
RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? 
LAFORGE: Beats me, Commander. Every question we answer here seems to
bring up two more.
PICARD: You're certain this is Vulcan? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Metallurgical analysis confirmed that and by running
a molecular pattern trace, we were actually able to identify the ship
as T'Pau. It was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot
at Qualor Two. As far as anybody knows it's still there.
WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant?
WORF [OC]: A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow. Compliments
of Gowron.
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain and
advise him that Mister Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.
RIKER: I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor Two, sir. See what's
out there.
PICARD: Agreed. Thank you, Mister La Forge.
