[Bridge]

WORF: Range now seventy five hundred. 
PICARD: Steady as she goes 
WORF: Probe is standing abeam. 
PICARD: Engage tractor. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Transporter beam locked, Captain. 
PICARD: Energise.

[Transporter room]

(Pulaski enters) 
O'BRIEN: Probe aboard, Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Acknowledged. Number One? 
RIKER: I'll welcome our visitor. 
PICARD: Resume original course and speed. 
CLANCEY: Aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]

(O'Brien starts pushing buttons on the probe. Riker
enters) 
LAFORGE: All yours, Commander. 
(La Forge leaves. The probe case unlocks, and Riker helps O'Brien lift
off the top. The inside is filled with a person. Pulaski scans and
shakes her head) 
RIKER: Something wrong, Doctor? 
PULASKI: I'm not sure. The readings are quite interesting. 
(The figure removes the lift support mask and reveals herself to be a
Klingon woman) 
K'EHLEYR: I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr. 
RIKER: nuqneH. qaleghneS. 
K'EHLEYR: You speak Klingon. 
RIKER: A little. I am Commander William Riker. This is Chief Medical
Officer Katherine Pulaski. I hope your voyage wasn't too unpleasant. 
K'EHLEYR: Klingons are not supposed to mind hardship. Nonetheless, I am
delighted to be out of that damned coffin. 
RIKER: I don't blame you. It's not the most luxurious accommodation
Starfleet has to offer. 
K'EHLEYR: Whoever said that getting there was half the fun never rode
in a class eight probe. 
PULASKI: How are you feeling? Your vital signs are rather atypical for
a Klingon. 
K'EHLEYR: No doubt because I am only half Klingon. 
PULASKI: Oh? 
K'EHLEYR: Yes. My father was Klingon. My mother was human. 
(And the lovely Susie Plaxton previously played a Vulcan on TNG)

[Observation Lounge]

RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant 
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? 
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. 
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. 
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. 
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. 
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. 
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. 
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? 
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. 
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. 
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? 
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. 
TROI: Why too late? 
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. 
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.

K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. 
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? 
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. 
PICARD: No. 
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. 
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. 
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. 
K'EHLEYR: Captain. 
(All leave except Picard and Worf) 
PICARD: Lieutenant? 
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? 
WORF: Yes. 
PICARD: Any professional reasons? 
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. 
PICARD: Good.
