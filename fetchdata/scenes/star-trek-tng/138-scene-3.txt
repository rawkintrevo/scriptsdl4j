WESLEY RIKER DATA TROI PICARD

[Transporter room]

RIKER: We've locked onto something with markings on
it. 
PICARD: What sort of markings? 
RIKER: Uncertain. Energise. 
(O'Brien beams a piece of curved metal construction aboard. He and
Riker go to the pad and turn it's outer surface to face us. Lo and
behold, a US flag and the letters NASA. The camera drools over it
lovingly. Why couldn't it be ESA for once?) 
PICARD: We've got ourselves a puzzle, Number One. 
RIKER: Yes sir. I think we have. 
[Observation lounge]

DATA: Analysis bears out that the object was
definitely terrestrial in origin, dated mid twenty first century. 
PICARD: No, no. No Earth ship of that time could have travelled out
this far. 
DATA: Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markings
we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis. 
TROI: Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? 
DATA: That is even more significant than the object itself, Counsellor.
On several of its surfaces, the molecules seem to have disintegrated 
RIKER: Disintegrated? How? 
DATA: Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. 
PICARD: Curiouser and curiouser. 
(Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland, if you needed reminding.) 
WESLEY [OC]: Captain, we've detected a large structure on the planet.
