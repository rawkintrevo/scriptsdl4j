[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: But we can't find the source. 
PICARD: If we can't correct it we may have to reverse course and leave
the nebula. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Give me a couple of minutes here, Captain.

SUTTER: Clara, now. 
(Clara leaves) 
SUTTER: I'm sorry, Commander.

[Corridor]

(Isabella appears) 
CLARA: Why do you keep disappearing like that? 
ISABELLA: The grown-ups don't believe I'm real. When they're around, I
have to be invisible. Wait here. 
(Isabella disappears)

[Engineering]

DATA: The drag coefficient continues to increase.
Our velocity has fallen by twelve percent. Velocity is increasing.
Ship's speed has stabilised at one quarter impulse. 
LAFORGE: That's great, Data. What'd you do? 
DATA: I did nothing. The problem seems to have corrected itself.

[Corridor]

(Isabella appears) 
CLARA: Where did you go? 
ISABELLA: There was something I had to do.

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: I don't have an explanation, Captain. We
seemed to hit something, then we started losing speed. So far as we can
tell, there's nothing out there to hit. 
RIKER: Could some kind of damping field have caused us to lose
velocity? 
DATA: We have simulated several such fields, but were unable to
reproduce the same drag coefficient. 
LAFORGE: And we still don't know why the problem suddenly corrected
itself. 
PICARD: It seems we're looking a unique phenomenon. One that hasn't
been recorded before. 
LAFORGE: The question is, do we stay here and check it out? 
RIKER: Might be dangerous. 
DATA: Since we have only experienced the phenomenon once, it is
impossible to estimate the risks. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'd like to stay here for a little bit, collect some
samples of the gaseous matter, see what it tells us. 
PICARD: Agreed. Collect your samples, Mister La Forge. We'll proceed
with caution. Dismissed.
