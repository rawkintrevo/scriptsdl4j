RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD ENSIGN RASMUSSEN DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Would you join me on the bridge, please. 
RIKER [OC]: Right away, sir. 
PICARD: Are you certain, Mister Worf? 
WORF: There was a space-time distortion, sir, and there is something
back there. We passed within three hundred kilometres of it. 
PICARD: It's too close to be a coincidence. Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: Would a delay of one hour affect your plans?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Not unless another asteroid decides to pay
a call on Penthara, sir. 
DATA: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely,
given the time frame. 
PICARD [OC]: Thank you, Mister Data.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign, bring the ship about. Let's take a
look at Mister Worf's distortion. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Mister Worf's what? 
PICARD: The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion almost
in our current course. There's a small object back there that wasn't
there a few moments ago. 
WORF: The object is fifty kilometres ahead, sir. 
PICARD: Full stop, Ensign. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER: Dimensions, Worf? 
WORF: Approximately five metres in length, sir. 
PICARD: Lifesigns? 
WORF: No signs of any kind. Our sensors do not penetrate the hull. 
PICARD: Try hailing it. 
WORF: That's odd. 
RIKER: What's odd? 
WORF: We've received a response, sir, but 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? 
WORF: They want you to move over, sir. 
PICARD: Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant. 
WORF: Not the Enterprise, Captain. You. 
PICARD: What are you trying to tell me? 
(and as Picard walks back towards Worf a figure appears where he was
standing)

RASMUSSEN: Oops. Excuse me, Captain, but you were standing right where
I needed to be. 
PICARD: Who are you? 
RASMUSSEN: Rasmussen's the name, sir. Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
Ah, this is wonderful. Actually, quite a bit larger than I thought. 
PICARD: Really? 
RASMUSSEN: Where I come from, every historian knows the bridge of old
1701D. 
PICARD: Where exactly do you come from? 
RASMUSSEN: Why, Earth. Late twenty sixth century Earth, to be exact.
I've travelled back nearly three hundred years just to find you.
