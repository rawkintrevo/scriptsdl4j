over.
(Alkar staggers) 
LIVA: Alkar.
JARTH: What is it?
ALKAR: I'm fine. Just a little light-headed.
LIVA: You're exhausted.
JARTH: Do you want a doctor?
ALKAR: No of course not.
PICARD [OC]: Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar. Respond, sir.
ALKAR: I'm here, Captain.

Enterprise immediately. Counsellor Troi is dying.

CRUSHER: Computer, make a note. Death occurred at fourteen thirty hours
from respiratory and renal failure.
ALKAR: Will you wait for me in my quarters?
LIVA: Of course.
(Liva leaves) 
ALKAR: It's a tragic loss, but her death had a purpose.
PICARD: I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done.
ALKAR: Your own Federation Council has granted me safe and timely
passage back to my planet. I expect you to honour that, Captain. 
(Alkar leaves) 
RIKER: How much longer do we have?
CRUSHER: Three minutes and forty seconds.
PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room Two lock on to the young woman in
Ambassador Alkar's quarters. We may have to transport her out of there.
CHIEF [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to station yourself outside her
quarters.
WORF: Aye, sir.
