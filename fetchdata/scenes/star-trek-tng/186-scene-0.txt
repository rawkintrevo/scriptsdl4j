PICARD RIKER DATA TROI WORF

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, we are nearing the periphery of
Sector twenty one five oh three. 
PICARD: Be on the lookout for a Cardassian patrol ship, Mister Worf.
They should be hailing us soon. 
RIKER: Even with a treaty, they're still skittish about protecting
their border. 
PICARD: Last time I was in this sector, I was on the Stargazer, running
at warp speed ahead of a Cardassian warship. 
TROI: Running, Captain? You? That's hard to believe. 
PICARD: Believe it. I'd been sent to make preliminary overtures to a
truce. I'd lowered my shields as a gesture of good will. But the
Cardassians were not impressed. They had taken out most of my weapons
and damaged the impulse engines before I could regroup and run. 
WORF: The Cardassians have no honour. I do not trust them. 
TROI: They're our allies now, Mister Worf. We have to trust them. 
WORF: Trust is earned, not given away. 
PICARD: I hope their scout ship makes contact soon. It's not a good
idea to stay too long on a Cardassian border without making your
intentions known.
