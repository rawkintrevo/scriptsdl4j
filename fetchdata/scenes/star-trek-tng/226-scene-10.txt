PICARD TROI DATA LAFORGE RIKER

[Devidia cavern]

(a strong light source casts the away teams shadows
on a sheer rock wall) 
LAFORGE: The concentration of triolic waves falls off about here. It

RIKER: What's the source? Something underground? 
LAFORGE: Negative, Commander. 
RIKER: What's the explanation? 
LAFORGE: I don't have one yet. La Forge to Enterprise. 
DATA [OC]: Go ahead.
LAFORGE: Data, run a spectral field correlation for me. Let's find out

LAFORGE [OC]: To the temporal distortions. 
DATA: Acknowledged.

RIKER: Deanna? 
TROI: There's life here. A child. An old woman. Dozens more. Hundreds.

DATA: Captain, the results of my temporal analysis may be pertinent. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
DATA: Geordi, it indicates a synchronic distortion in the areas
emanating
