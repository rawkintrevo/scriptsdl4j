[Troi's office]

COMPUTER: Devinoni Ral, human. Age forty one. Born
Brussels, European Alliance. Relocated at age nineteen to Hurkos Three.

TROI: Come in. 
RAL: Should I call for an appointment ? 
TROI: No, I was just looking over some personnel files. 
RAL: Well, that's too bad. I thought you might be thinking about me. 
TROI: I thought you'd be deep in negotiations by now. 
RAL: In recess. I never play the opening rounds, anyway.
Inconsequential. Besides there are much better things to negotiate on
this ship. Like dinner tonight? 
TROI: What about your travelling companion? 
RAL: My travelling companion is travelling. I sent her home. 
TROI: Why? 
RAL: You know why. 
TROI: Weren't you getting along? 
RAL: Don't do that. 
TROI: What? 
RAL: Don't do Counsellor Troi. 
TROI: Was I? 
RAL: Yes, you were. When you leave this office, who are you? Oh. So
that's how it goes. You never do. You never do leave the office. 
TROI: What 
RAL: Shush. 
(He strokes her hair) 
RAL: Dinner at eight?

[Ready room]

DATA: The data from the Barzan's probe of the
wormhole are quite impressive, Captain. The wormhole delivered the
probe beyond the Denkiri Arm, in the Gamma Quadrant. 
PICARD: It would take nearly a century at warp nine to cover that
distance. 
DATA: The same distance could be achieved in a matter of seconds
through the wormhole. 
RIKER: Imagine the Ferengi collecting tolls if we lose to them. 
GUEST0: I don't think the Ferengi are the greatest threat at the
table. With all of DaiMon Goss' bluster, they don't have the resources
the Barzans need. 
RIKER: I think that Devinoni is the one that we need to watch out for. 
GUEST0: An accurate observation. How did you recognise that? 
RIKER: He was the most one in the group. 
GUEST0: You must play poker, Commander. 
RIKER: Poker? Is that a game of some sort? 
PICARD: Commander Riker conducts masterclasses in poker. 
GUEST0: Our skills are not dissimilar, Commander. 
PICARD: Mister Mendoza, if this lives up to its billing, it will be a
discovery of extraordinary value. But it is a big if. 
RIKER: A wormholes is there one moment, and then gone the next. A
stable wormhole is unheard of. 
GUEST0: Are you saying this may not be what it seems? 
DATA: The Barzans do not have manned space travel, so they had to
resort to an automated probe. Its findings are limited. It cannot be
determined from these charts how stable the wormhole really is, or how
long it will remain intact. 
PICARD: The Federation could wind up buying a proverbial lemon. 
DATA: Proverbial lemon? 
PICARD: Later, Data. 
GUEST0: And of course that means, once the contract is negotiated and
closed, we would be obliged to fulfill the terms. 
RIKER: We think we should take a look for ourselves. 
GUEST0: I don't think Bhavani could object to that. 
RIKER: Geordi has continuous visual contact with the wormhole, Captain.
I think he's the logical choice. 
DATA: I would also like to volunteer, sir. 
PICARD: Nobody's going in there until we have done a full sensor
analysis. I want to do everything possible to determine that it's safe,
and when I am satisfied, then you, Data, and Commander La Forge will
enter the wormhole
tomorrow.
