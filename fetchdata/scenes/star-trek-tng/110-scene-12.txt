TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER VOICES KAZAGO CRUSHER DATA

[Stargazer Captain's quarters]

(Picard jerks up in pain and clutches at his head
before collapsing. Crusher enters) 
CRUSHER: Captain? Another headache? This really worries me. I want you
back on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: But my things 
CRUSHER: I'll see they're sent to your Enterprise quarters.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Enterprise now taking possession of
Stargazer, Kazago. 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: Permission granted, Riker. 
RIKER: Actually it was quite a bargain, Kazago. I thought the Ferengi
always made a profit on things. 
(Kazago growls and ends the transmission) 
RIKER: Set sub-warp speed for towing, LaForge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(Picard enters, in pain) 
DATA: Starfleet has responded to our request, sir. A tug will
rendezvous with us and tow the Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase Nine. 
PICARD: Very well, Data. 
RIKER: How was it, Captain? 
PICARD: Very strange, Number One. Like going back to the house you grew
up in, but no one's home, except the phantoms of the past. 
TROI: It has troubled you? 
PICARD: Not half as much as this damn headache. Take over, Number One. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: What's wrong? 
TROI: I wish I could say.

[Picard's quarters]

(The trunk has been delivered. Picard goes to lie
down on his bed) 
VOICES [OC]: Shields weakening, Captain. Torpedoes armed. Where are
they? Oh my god, sir! Fire! Fire!

[Ready Room]

RIKER: What is it, Data? Why all the mystery? 
DATA: The records of the Stargazer, sir. What the Ferengi call the
Battle of Maxia. It seems the Captain's personal log contains a much
different version of that conflict than the official historic account. 
RIKER: What are you saying? 
DATA: It would appear that the starship which Captain Picard attacked,
had in fact, been under a flag of truce. 
RIKER: What? 
DATA: And apparently, the Captain destroyed the ship without notice or
provocation. 
RIKER: Impossible. What about the fire aboard the Stargazer? 
DATA: An accident in Engineering. 
RIKER: And what proof? 
DATA: It is logged in his own voice, sir. Would you care to hear it,
sir? Sir?
