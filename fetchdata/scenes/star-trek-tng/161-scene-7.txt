[Corridor]

Q: Humans are such commonplace little creatures.
They roam the galaxy looking for something, they know not what. 
DATA: The human race has an enduring desire for knowledge, and for new
opportunities to improve itself. 
Q: There's certainly room for improvement, but the truth is, Data, they
are a minor species in the grand scheme. Not worth your envy. 
DATA: Oh, I do not feel envy. 
Q: Well, that's good. 
DATA: I feel nothing at all. That is part of my dilemma. I have the
curiosity of humans, but there are questions I will never have the
answer to. What is it like to laugh, or cry, or to experience any human
emotions. 
Q: Well, if you ask me, these human emotions are not what they're
cracked up to be.

LAFORGE: The moon will hit its perigee in ten
hours. Now, we match its trajectory, increase emitter coolant rate so
we can apply
continuous warp-equivalent power nine to the tractor beam. We can push
it for nearly seven hours and I think that just might do it. But,
there's a problem. 
DATA: The Enterprise will be dangerously close to the atmosphere. 
LAFORGE: That's the problem. 
Q: This is incredible. 
LAFORGE: You see something here, Q? 
Q: I think I just hurt my back. I'm feeling pain. I don't like it.
What's the right thing to say? Ow? 
LAFORGE + DATA: Ow. 
Q: Ow! I can't straighten up. 
DATA: Medical assistance to Engineering. 
LAFORGE: Q, I've got a few people down on Bre'el Four who are going to
be hurt 
Q: Yes, yes, your marvellous plan will not only tear the moon to pieces
but your precious ship as well. 
LAFORGE: You got a better idea? 
Q: I would certainly begin by examining the cause and not the symptom. 
LAFORGE: We've done that, Q, and there's no way to 
Q: This is obviously the result of a large celestial object passing
through at near right angles to the plane of the star system. Probably
a black hole. 
DATA: Can you recommend a way to counter the effect? 
Q: Simple. Change the gravitational constant of the universe. 
LAFORGE: What? 
Q: Change the gravitational constant of the universe, thereby altering
the mass of the asteroid. 
LAFORGE: Redefine gravity? How am I supposed to do that? 
Q: You just do it. Where's that Doctor, anyway? 
DATA: Geordi is trying to say that changing the gravitational constant
of the universe is beyond our capabilities. 
Q: Oh. In that case, never mind. 
(Crusher enters) 
Q: Ah, Doctor Crusher. I see Starfleet has shipped you back into exile.

DATA: Q says he has hurt his back. 
CRUSHER: Ah ha. Well, if I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't
believe it. According to this, he has classic back trauma. Muscle
spasms. 
Q: I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Family problems. 
CRUSHER: Well. don't expect too much sympathy from me. You've been a
pain in our backside often enough. 
Q: Your bedside manner is admirable, Doctor. I'm sure your patients
recover quickly just to get away from you. 
LAFORGE: You know, this might work. We can't change the gravitational
constant of the universe, but if we wrap a low level warp field around
that moon, we could reduce its gravitational constant. Make it lighter
so we can push it. 
Q: Glad I could help. Ow. I think. 
CRUSHER: Now what? 
Q: There's something wrong with my stomach. 
CRUSHER: It hurts? 
Q: It's making noises. 
CRUSHER: Maybe you're hungry.
