ROGA RIKER DATA WORF PICARD

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, unauthorised access of turbolift five on
deck thirty four. 
RIKER: He took the bait. 
PICARD: Data, override its destination. Divert that turbolift to a
position near Lieutenant Worf's present location. 
DATA: Four seconds to arrival, sir. 
[Corridor]

WORF: We're in position. 
(The turbolift door opens and there a high-pitched whining, but no
person) 
WORF: Phaser on overload! Seal this deck. 
(Worf steps into the lift to deactivate the phaser)

[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: Captain, the overload has been averted. 
[Corridor]

(Back where Danar first spotted the guard, he now
knocks the man out and uses his comm. badge) 
ROGA: Drop force field on deck thirty six.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, containment field down on deck thirty
six. 
RIKER: How the hell did he manage that? 
PICARD: He's headed for Engineering. 
RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Engineering, respond.

[Engineering]

(Everyone is out cold) 
RIKER [OC]: Engineering!. Engineering, come in! Geordi, are you okay? 
(No, he's slumped against a bulkhead with his Visor lying on the floor,
as Danar starts rearranging isolinear chips in a panel)

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, someone in Engineering is attempting
to override the security system lockout. 
RIKER: Riker to Worf, he's in Engineering. 
[Corridor]

WORF: Acknowledged, Commander. We're on our way.
