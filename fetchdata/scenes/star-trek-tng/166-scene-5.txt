DATA: Commander, ship's sensors detect an abnormal
energy reading in the Captain's quarters. 
RIKER: Type? 
DATA: Undetermined. 
RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. 
WORF: Security team to Captain's quarters.

[Holding cell]

(Picard wakes up in a hexagonal room with a thing
in the middle. There are a total of four beds, two more of which are
occupied) 
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. Anyone receiving this transmission,
please respond.

[Outside Picard's quarters]

WORF: Security override. Priority one. 
(The door opens to reveal - Picard holding his book and a glass of
brandy) 
PICARD 2: Is something the matter, Lieutenant?

[Holding cell]

(One of the other bed occupants is also in a
Starfleet engineering uniform. she is a green-tinged alien) 
PICARD: It's all right, it's al right. I'm not going to hurt you. 
HARO: Captain. 
PICARD: Picard, of the Enterprise. 
HARO: Captain Picard. We studied your missions at the Academy Mitena
Haro, first year cadet, Starfleet Academy. 
PICARD: Cadet Haro. 
THOLL: Perhaps you can explain what this is all about. 
(A tall, white-skinned alien wearing a hood) 
PICARD: Unfortunately, I can't, Mister 
THOLL: Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two. 
PICARD: Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought here
against my will. Wherever here is. 
HARO: The same thing happened to me, sir. I was alone, studying and I
fainted. When I came to, it was about three days ago. 
PICARD: And you, sir? 
THOLL: I've been here twelve days, possibly more. I had been meditating
privately and for no reason whatever, I lost
consciousness. 
PICARD: What can you tell me about our captors? 
THOLL: Nothing. They've never shown themselves. 
PICARD: Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by another
captive. 
(He goes to the central thing, which dispenses red roundels) 
THOLL: It's edible, but I wouldn't call it food. 
(Picard takes a tentative bite and puts it down, then goes to the panel
by the door) 
THOLL: I wouldn't touch that. 
PICARD: Why not? 
THOLL: If it's the door lock, the combination's too complex to hit at
random. I tried it and was punished. 
PICARD: Punished? How? 
THOLL: Severe pain. Some sort of energy beam. I won't get near that
panel again.

WORF: Sir, the Hood has arrived at the rendezvous
point. They are expecting us in thirty six hours. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Data, the nearest pulsar is in
the Lonka cluster, is it not? 
DATA: Correct, sir. 
PICARD 2: What do we know about that pulsar? 
DATA: A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximately
four point three five six solar masses. 
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? 
WESLEY: At warp seven, thirty four minutes. 
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher make it so. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD 2: Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two.

one hours. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Ensign. Engage. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Will we be delaying our rendezvous with the Hood, sir? 
PICARD 2: We may have to, Number One. 
RIKER: Lieutenant, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay. 
WORF: Aye, Commander. 
PICARD 2: Belay that order. There will be no further communication off
this ship without my prior authorisation. Commander, may I have a word
with you? Mister Data, you have the bridge. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
