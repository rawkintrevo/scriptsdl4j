PICARD: Can you help her? 
CRUSHER: I've done everything I can. I don't understand the nature of
this music she says she's hearing, or where it's coming from. 
PICARD: Could it be telepathic? 
CRUSHER: Yes. But I'm not the expert at determining that. 
PICARD: They're blocking her sensitivity. They're stopping her from
seeing the truth. 
CRUSHER: Who's stopping her? 
PICARD: Kevin and Rishon. 
CRUSHER: What? 
PICARD: They wanted us to leave Rana and that's exactly what we're
doing. Picard to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Number One, I want you to maintain this course for another hour

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: And then turn the Enterprise around
and take it back to Rana Four. 
RIKER: We still won't have our shields restored by then. 
[Troi's quarters]

PICARD: Take it back, Number One, and this time
nothing is going to lure us away.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, sensors indicate no spacecraft in the
vicinity of Rana Four. But, Captain 
PICARD: Forget your previous error, Mister Worf. There is no way you
could have prevented it. 
DATA: Captain, the Uxbridge house is coming into transporter range. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you accompany me to the Transporter Room? You
have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Captain, I think you should reconsider. The warship has come
after us twice. It could come back. 
PICARD: I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. I
think it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that will
all change once I'm back on board. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes.
Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure, but
that's what I'm going to put to the test.

(Kevin and Rishon are dancing to the music box) 
PICARD: Celebrating? 
KEVIN: What are you doing here? What do you want? 
PICARD: This is the second time that you have shown surprise at my
appearance, Kevin. The first time was understandable, but now? Unless
it is because you never expected to see me again. 
KEVIN: Why do you keep interfering with our lives, Captain? 
PICARD: It is not my intention to interfere. Only to help you and
Rishon. 
KEVIN: Then please, leave us alone. 
PICARD: I promise you that when I leave this house I will never set
foot in it again. But the Enterprise will remain in orbit over the
planet. 
RISHON: Why? 
PICARD: To protect you. 
KEVIN: That's not necessary. I thought you understood. 
PICARD: It is necessary. You're in great danger. A warship has
returned. 
RISHON: Kevin! 
KEVIN: He's lying, Rishon. 
PICARD: We have fought a pitched battle with it, and lost. Many of my
crew have been injured including a woman who's mind is slowly being
destroyed by telepathic manipulation. 
RISHON: No. Please no. 
KEVIN: This is a form of intimidation. I have my rights. 
PICARD: Your rights? What about Rishon? Is she in favour of being here
left here? Come to the Enterprise. Let me take you where you'll be
safe. 
RISHON: No. I can't leave Kevin. 
KEVIN: I'm staying. She's safe here with me. in this house. 
PICARD: Why are you safe?. Why is this house a sanctuary? Does it have
to do with you? With your refusal to fight? Tell me this. If Rishon
were in danger, would you kill to save her life? 
KEVIN: No, not for her. Not for anyone. I will not kill. 
RISHON: Please stop hurting him. Captain, leave our house. 
PICARD: It is my sworn duty to protect you. The Enterprise will remain
in orbit around Rana Four as long as the two of you are alive.
