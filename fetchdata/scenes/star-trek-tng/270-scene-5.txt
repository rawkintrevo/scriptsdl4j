DATA: We are losing containment in the starboard
nacelle tube. 
PICARD: Try to get more power to the field coils. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Report. 
LAFORGE: I can't shut down the plasma injectors. Somebody's locked out
the controls.

[Bridge]

DATA: The plasma venting system has engaged.

[Jefferies tube]

(climbing ladders) 
WORF: Two more decks. 
RIKER: Riker to Bridge. We've almost reached the nacelle tube. 
PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Release the exterior hull plate. We may
have to jettison the core. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Nacelle control]

(there is a man poised to jump into the plasma) 
RIKER: What happened? 
NARA: (alien woman) He locked out the controls. Before we knew what was
happening, he stepped up onto the walkway. 
RIKER: (to Worf) See if you can help shut down the plasma flow. 
NARA: I'm afraid if we try to get any closer, he will jump through the
forcefield. 
RIKER: Dan, it's me. It's Will Riker. I was here yesterday, remember? 
KWAN: (alien man) I didn't want to do it. But I saw them. And they
laughed at me. They laughed. 
(Riker is on the walkway) 
RIKER: Whatever happened, we can talk about it. I want to help. 
KWAN: Stay away! 
RIKER: I just want to see your face, that's all. So we can talk. 
KWAN: I know what I have to do. 
RIKER: Dan, no! 
WORF: I have unlocked the controls. 
COMPUTER: Shutdown procedure initiated. 
NARA: There's still plasma in the injector. It'll take time to vent
off. 
RIKER: Tell me what happened. Maybe I can help. 
KWAN: I know what I have to do. 
(and he jumps into the plasma stream. Riker hits the bulkhead in anger
and frustration and despair)
