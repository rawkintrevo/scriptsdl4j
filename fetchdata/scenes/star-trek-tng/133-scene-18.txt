PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, this is Kate Pulaski. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: Doctor? Do you have a decision? 
PULASKI: I'm afraid it's bad news. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: How can that be?! 
PULASKI: The risk to the ship and crew is too great. Until we
absolutely know the cause of the disease, the children 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: The children are harmless. Every test on them
has been negative. I demand that you do something to save them. Please,
Doctor. For God's sake, we haven't got much time. 
PULASKI: Stand by. I'll get back to you.

[Engineering]

PULASKI: Geordi, I need your help. 
LAFORGE: What is it, Doctor. 
PULASKI: I need to prove the children are harmless. I can only do that
in a fail-safe environment. 
LAFORGE: The problem is there's no area on the ship that can be sealed
off with absolute certainty, even with force fields. 
PULASKI: Sickbay has an isolated system. 
LAFORGE: But it's not possible to totally cut it off from the rest of
the ship. The only truly independent environment would be something
like a shuttlecraft. 
PULASKI: A shuttlecraft. Why didn't you say so?

PICARD: Come. 
PULASKI: Captain, I'd like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft.
I can study him there without risk to anyone else. 
PICARD: What about you?

same air he breathes, to touch him. I'm volunteering to make that test

PICARD: Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which goes 
PULASKI: I also have a responsibility to humanity. 
PICARD: Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined 
PULASKI: You don't have to quote the rule book. You were saying?

PULASKI: Captain, you said if I. Approved? 
PICARD: I recognise that you're trying to satisfy my conditions. 
PULASKI: Thank you.

DATA: You sent for me, Doctor? 
PULASKI: I did, Commander. I assume that you're qualified to pilot this
shuttlecraft. 
DATA: Certainly. I took advanced training in the operation of auxiliary
space vessels at Starfleet Academy, where I
received 
PULASKI: A more than passing grade, no doubt. Please, come aboard. We
don't have much time. 
COMPUTER: Shuttlebay three force field activated. 
[Shuttlecraft]

DATA: You're certain the Captain approved this,
Doctor? 
PULASKI: You'll take us a few hundred metres away from the Enterprise
