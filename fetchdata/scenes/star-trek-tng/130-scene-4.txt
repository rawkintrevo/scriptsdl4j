ROBINSON DATA LAFORGE OKONA

[Engineering]

(Geordi is working on the module in his private
alcove) 
OKONA: Will that do what the original did? 
LAFORGE: Sure will, and better. Let me show you. On your old one, the
zelebium contacts that wore down and then fused. What I've done is
replace them with tricellite. 
OKONA: Tricellite isn't available in this system. If I ever had to
replace it. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry, you won't. Your ship will never outlast this
part. 
OKONA: Because of the part or the way I fly my ship? 
LAFORGE: Well, this part, but the stress test did show that you tend to
push your ship a little beyond its design capabilities. 
OKONA: Blame the pattern of my life, Lieutenant La Forge. Because it
relegates me to cargo carrying rather than the grand explorations you
enjoy, I'm forced to add a measure of flamboyancy and a zest to the
doldrum of my existence. 
[Corridor]

OKONA: Have you ever been cold? 
DATA: No. 
OKONA: Warm, then? 
DATA: No. 
OKONA: What about drunk? Ever do that? 
DATA: From alcohol? That is not possible for me, sir. 
OKONA: Pity. What about love? 
DATA: The act or the emotion? 
OKONA: They're both the same. 
DATA: I believe that statement to be inaccurate, sir. 
OKONA: Maybe. Life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your
spacecraft. If it's canaries and you can keep half of them flying all
the time, you're all right. 
DATA: I doubt that statement is entirely accurate either, sir. 
OKONA: Accurate? That was a joke I just told you. 
DATA: I do not understand. 
OKONA: You don't know what a joke is? 
DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, a
fluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending. 
OKONA: That's the dictionary meaning. I'm talking about humour, fun. Do
you know what funny is? (blank) Where is eight oh six? 
DATA: Right over there, sir. Why? 
OKONA: You probably wouldn't understand that either. 
(The door opens to reveal Robinson in a slinky dress, waiting for
Okona) 
ROBINSON: Hello, there.
