(Bronze age proto-vulcan apparently means slanted
eyebrows, pointed ears and nineteenth century farm worker clothing) 
LIKO: (a man) Why did we have to come so early? 
OJI: (a young woman) When the sun reaches its zenith, I have to be
ready to take the measurements. 
LIKO: You'll be ready. You've read the sundial hundreds of times. 
OJI: Yes, father, but never as the appointed record keeper. 
(At the sun dial in front of the assembly hall - a lovely carved wooden
specimen) 
LIKO: You're taking your duties quite seriously. Your mother would have
been proud of you. 
OJI: What is that? Up there, father. What is it? 
(A glint of light from the duck blind) 
LIKO: I don't know.

[Duck blind]

(Crusher revives Barron) BARRON: Keep work. Palmer.

CRUSHER: It's all right. It's all right. 
DATA: The hologram generator is now functioning, sir. 
RIKER: All we need now is power. 
LAFORGE: Almost there.

(Liko and Oji have climbed up to investigate the
flashes, and can see the duckblind quite clearly now) 
LIKO: You wait here, Oji. 
(Liko climbs right up to the window and looks inside)
