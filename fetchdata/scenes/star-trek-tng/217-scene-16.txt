[Troi's quarters]

(Troi is taking a woollen doll from a suitcase when
the doorbell rings) 
TROI: Come in. Hello, Will. 
RIKER: What's all this? 
TROI: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one of
my father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turned
up. 
RIKER: Do you know who any of these people are? 
TROI: No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most of them don't. I
look at these faces and I wonder who they are and if they could be
related to me. 
RIKER: This one looks like you. (a cuddly toy) Deanna, I have something
on my mind. I had to see you. 
TROI: Has something happened? 
RIKER: I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. 
TROI: Soren. 
RIKER: Yes. You're my friend. I thought, I don't know, I thought I
should tell you. 
TROI: I'm glad you did. 
RIKER: Nothing will change between us, will it? 
TROI: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. But
we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life,
and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. 
(and they kiss, too) 
[Guest quarters]

RIKER: Hello. I'm here to see Soren. 
KRITE: I know. 
RIKER: We had an appointment. We were going to discuss 
KRITE: I don't think so, Commander. 
RIKER: Excuse me? 
KRITE: We know about the two of you. We know what you're doing. 
RIKER: Where is Soren? 
KRITE: We're going to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
RIKER: Answer me. Where is Soren? 
KRITE: In custody, and there's nothing you can do about it. 
RIKER: The hell there isn't.
