RO TROI OBRIEN LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER CREWMAN CRUSHER DATA

[Transporter room]

CREWMAN: Bridge, the entire transporter array has
been taken off line and placed into diagnostic mode. 
[Bridge]

CREWMAN [OC]: I can't override. It'll take a couple
of hours to complete the cycle. 
PICARD: How many people are down there? 
RO: Seventeen. They just shut down the internal scanners too, Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. 
CRUSHER [OC]: On my way.

[Ten Forward]

TROI: What are you doing now? 
DATA: I can reverse the polarity of their forcefields to isolate this
room. 
TROI: Good. 
O'BRIEN: Their communicators. Now they will learn nothing but what we
tell them.

[Bridge]

RO: They've done something to the forcefields on
deck ten, section one. 
RIKER: Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't recognise the configurations, but they've completely
isolated Ten Forward. 
RIKER: What about flooding their air vents with anaesthezine gas? 
LAFORGE: That won't affect Data. No rescue plan will work unless we can
knock out all three of them. 
RIKER: A concussive charge would blow out the security fields. We could
go in with phasers on wide beam, stun everybody. Sort it out later. 
PICARD: Doctor, go back to the biofilter readouts taken of the away
team's transport from the moon's surface. See if you can come up with
any clue that might explain this. 
PICARD: Ten Forward, this is Captain Picard. I am prepared to discuss
this situation. There is no need for further violence.

[Ten Forward]

PICARD [OC]: Please identify yourselves. 
TROI: They will now attempt to negotiate for the safety and release of
their people. Interesting. Under normal circumstances, I would be
counselling the Captain at a time like this. 
O'BRIEN: And what would you tell him to do? 
TROI: I would help him find a way to secure our trust. 
DATA: What are you looking at? You, Klingon. Attack me. (Data throws
his phaser to Miles)
Are you afraid? 
WORF: I have no fear of death. 
DATA: And I have no fear of killing you. 
TROI: Stop it! 
PICARD [OC]: Please respond, Ten Forward. Are there any members of my
crew who require medical assistance? 
TROI: We can discuss your wounded, but first you will move the ship.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Move it where? 
TROI [OC]: You will
