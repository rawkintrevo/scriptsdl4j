RIKER CRUSHER DATA YUTA

[Sickbay]

RIKER: You're scowling, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I'm thinking. 
RIKER: And? 
CRUSHER: The old Gatherer on the planet? I know what caused his heart
attack. The medical tricorder almost missed it, but there was a
microvirus in his body, blocking his autonomic nerve impulses. 
RIKER: And that stopped his heart? 
CRUSHER: But here's the really interesting part. This microvirus will
only attach itself to cells which contain a very specific DNA sequence.

RIKER: How specific? 
CRUSHER: Without knowing more about their genetic makeup, I can't be
sure. But my guess is, this virus would only kill one Acamarian in a
million. 
RIKER: Pretty single-minded bug. 
CRUSHER: Too single-minded. I can't believe it's a naturally occurring
virus. 
RIKER: Meaning somebody engineered it. 
CRUSHER: Meaning Volnoth was murdered.

[Riker's quarters]

DATA [OC]: Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to your
request for access to their databases. They are now being transmitted
into our computer over subspace link. 
RIKER: Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when Acamar's medical database is
online. Riker out. Come in. 
YUTA: I'm disturbing you. 
RIKER: Not at all. 
YUTA: As the Sovereign has no further need for my services this
evening, she suggested I might spend some time with you. 
RIKER: What a charming suggestion. 
YUTA: She appreciates the affection you've shown me. 
RIKER: Was I that obvious? 
YUTA: Yes. 
RIKER: Well, I've already dined. Maybe you know a good Acamarian
dessert recipe. 
(A kiss, of course) 
YUTA: Does that not please you? Tell me what you want, William. I will
do anything you wish. 
RIKER: Wait a minute. 
YUTA: I don't understand. Don't you want me to give you pleasure? 
RIKER: Not as a servant. I told you, I prefer equals. 
YUTA: Even in the matters of love? 
RIKER: Especially in matters of love. 
YUTA: I've offended you. 
RIKER: No. I only want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
You're entitled to that. 
YUTA: No, I'm not. 
RIKER: Yuta. 
YUTA: I do not feel pleasure, or passion. I haven't been able to for a
long time. 
RIKER: I don't know who did this to you, or why, but it can change. 
YUTA: I wish it could. Tonight most of all. I'm sorry. 
(She turns to go, he pulls her back into his embrace, then Red Alert
sounds and the ship shakes)
