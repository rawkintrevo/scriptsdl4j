[Chorgan's ship]

GUEST3: Three seats on the ruling council? 
GUEST1: If we're going to be subject to your laws, we want a part in
making it. 
GUEST3: Well I agree you're entitled to representation but not on the
ruling council. 
GUEST1: Unacceptable. The real power is in the council. You're
shutting us off already. 
GUEST3: No! You're trying to take too much! No group has three seats on
the council. 
GUEST1: I don't care what others have. 
GUEST3: You only care about what you can take. 
PICARD: Sovereign, if the situation were reversed, I'm sure you would
be demanding equal levels of representation. 
GUEST3: You're right, Captain. I apologise for my temper. 
PICARD: Perhaps a brief pause would be helpful. 
GUEST1: I agree. Maybe a little touch of that brandy? 
GUEST3: Yuta. 
PICARD: You know, thank you, it is remarkable how very much alike the
two of you actually are. 
GUEST1: That's ridiculous. 
GUEST3: Really, Captain. 
PICARD: No, I'm quite serious. You are both able negotiators, strong
leaders. 
GUEST4: We don't obey weak leaders. 
GUEST1: We have nothing in common at all. We haven't agreed to
anything. 
PICARD: You're wrong, Chorgan. We've agreed to have some brandy
together. 
(Yuta is serving Marouk when Riker beams in. He has to stun a Gatherer
guard) 
RIKER: Don't move! 
GUEST1: A Federation trap! 
PICARD: Chorgan, I assure you, my First Officer has a good reason for
his actions. You do, Number One? 
RIKER: Yuta. Move away from Chorgan. Do it. 
GUEST5: Why? 
RIKER: Because of a man you once knew named Penthar-Mul. 
GUEST1: Penthar-Mul? How do you know Penthar-Mul? 
RIKER: Tell him, Yuta. 
GUEST5: I don't understand. 
RIKER: You were with Penthar-Mul when he died. 
GUEST5: It was fifty years ago. How could I? 
RIKER: I know, Yuta. Stop! Chorgan, keep perfectly still. Your life is
in danger. Step back, Yuta. 
GUEST5: William, this is not your concern. 
RIKER: It is now. You're about to commit a murder. 
GUEST5: It isn't murder. It's justice. 
GUEST1: Who are you? 
GUEST5: Yuta of the clan Tralesta. 
GUEST1: There are no more Tralestas. 
GUEST5: Five survived the last Lornak raid. But on that day, a century
ago, my life ended and my search began. I was the one chosen,
transformed. My cells were altered, my aging slowed, enough to finish
my task. 
GUEST3: You used me in order to get to the last few you couldn't reach.

GUEST5: Yes, Sovereign. 
GUEST1: You will never leave this ship alive. 
GUEST5: You're the last. Once you're dead, what happens to me doesn't
matter. 
RIKER: The wars are over, Yuta. 
GUEST5: You cannot understand. 
RIKER: You're right, I can't. Because I've seen the part of you that
regrets what you've become. Listen to me. You don't have to do this any
more. 
GUEST5: I have no choice. 
RIKER: You do. 
GUEST5: William, I. I'm sorry. 
RIKER: Stop. 
(The first shot is a mild stun. Yuta staggers, then reaches for Chorgan
again. The next shot is higher. Then Riker puts the phaser up to full
power) 
RIKER: Yuta, don't do this. 
(She moves towards Chorgan again, and Riker vapourises her) 
GUEST1: Commander, I am in your debt.
