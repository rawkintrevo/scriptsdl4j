PICARD TROI CRUSHER JONO ENDAR

[Doctor's office]

PICARD: So you think it would be unwise to let
Endar see Jono? 
CRUSHER: I think it's dangerous. Abusers can have subtle but powerful
influence over their victims. 
PICARD: You see, I'm not convinced the boy has been abused, Doctor.
I've talked with the father, and if I am any judge of character, I
would say that he deeply cares for the boy's welfare. 
TROI: I sense awakening memories in the boy. This is a very fragile
time for Jono. If we send away the man he calls father without even
letting them see each other, how will we ever gain his trust? 
PICARD: Yes. There is something else to keep in mind. We are deep in
Talarian territory. A semblance of diplomacy is called for. I'm going
to agree to the meeting. 
CRUSHER: All I ask is that the visit be supervised. Don't let them be
alone together. 
PICARD: Agreed.

[Observation lounge]

(Troi is with Endar when Picard and Jono enter) 
JONO: Endar. 
ENDAR: Jono, my son. 
(They touch foreheads, Picard and Troi turn their backs) 
ENDAR: Have they treated you well? 
JONO: Yes, Captain. Except 
ENDAR: Except what? 
JONO: I was forbidden to make the B'Nar. 
ENDAR: That's all right. I know you've mourned in your heart. Well,
Jono what do you think of these humans? 
JONO: They look like me. 
ENDAR: They want to keep you, you know. 
JONO: Yes, I know. 
ENDAR: You've reached the age of decision. What is your choice? Do you
want to stay? 
JONO: No, of course not. 
ENDAR: Then you shall not. I'm returning to the Q'Maire. I will give
the humans with a choice. If they do not make the one we know is right,
it may lead to war. You may die. 
JONO: I am ready to die.
