(Mr. Steven Miller, Mrs. Victoria Miller and their
son Wyatt beam aboard) 
PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.

STEVEN: Quite some starship you have here, Captain. Look forward to
this visit. 
VICTORIA: You couldn't be 
TROI: I'm Deanna. 
VICTORIA: Deanna darling! You probably don't even remember me. 
STEVEN: Wyatt was absolutely right. She is a beauty. 
WYATT: I'm Wyatt. 
VICTORIA: Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was still alive,
somewhere. 
WYATT: I'd like you to have this. It's a Chameleon Rose. It changes
colour with the mood of its owner. 
TROI: It's wonderful. Thank you. When is my mother arriving? 
WYATT: Your mother is still down on the planet, Deanna. 
TROI: Why? 
WYATT: Er, is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain? 
STEVEN: Well, we're not really tired, son. Besides, I'd like to see
some of the ship. 
VICTORIA: Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam
on aboard until we leave. So? 
PICARD: You can see your quarters now, if you like. Will you show the
Millers to their accommodations, please, and I shall join you later. 
(The Millers leave) 
CHIEF: Two more are ready to beam in, sir. 
PICARD: So be it. Wyatt seems a fine young man. 
TROI: Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. 
PICARD: I don't understand. 
TROI: Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him.
I should warn you, sir. My mother is a little eccentric. 
(A large man is sitting on a chest, and a woman has her back to them) 
LWAXANA: Where is everyone? Oh, I hate that. 
TROI: Hello, Mother 
LWAXANA [OC]: Don't say it, think it. Use your mind, not your mouth. 
TROI: Hello Mother. 
LWAXANA [OC]: Deanna, shame. What has this life done to you? 
LWAXANA: No, don't tell me. You're the Captain. 
PICARD: Of course. Your daughter has explained your telepathic ability.

LWAXANA: That wasn't telepathy, it was just common sense. Who else
would they send to greet me but the Captain? You may carry my luggage. 
TROI: Mother! 
PICARD: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother for
the fine Counsellor she 
(The luggage is heavier than he expected. A lot heavier) 
PICARD: (straining himself) This way.

[Corridor]

TROI: Mother, it's quite inappropriate to ask the
captain to 
LWAXANA: Yes, you do seem to be having difficulty. A man your age must
work to keep himself in shape. 
TROI: Mother, I'm not going another step like this. A starship has its
customs, just as we do. If you're my mother's valet, then please valet!

PICARD: Oh, please don't let me keep up from doing your duty. 
LWAXANA: I apologise for her behaviour. Do you realise you've
embarrassed your Captain? 
PICARD: Oh, no. 
LWAXANA: Anything to avoid a quarrel on this occasion. It's amazing how
that accent of yours reminds me of your father. 
(Mr. Homn the valet lifts the case with ease) 
TROI: Your last valet tried so hard to rid me of it. Whatever happened
to Mister Xelo? 
LWAXANA: I was forced to terminate his employment. Xelo was strongly
attracted to me. His thoughts became truly pornographic.

[Turbolift]

LWAXANA: Of course, the thoughts of Wyatt's father
toward me were almost as vulgar, but he really doesn't have Xelo's 
PICARD: Passenger accommodation. 
LWAXANA: He doesn't really have Xelo's imagination. 
TROI: Mother. 
LWAXANA: Between him and that woman's inane chatter, it's a wonder I
made it here at all. How do you like the Millers, Captain? 
PICARD: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant 
LWAXANA: As for me, I find it shocking how they've changed in the years
since my husband and I knew them. Of course, it's probably because I've
grown beyond them. You realise of course that with Betazoids, our
ability to read the thoughts of others does see us grow much faster
than the typical plodding human who 
TROI [OC]: Mother, that's enough! 
LWAXANA [OC]: So, you're not totally out of practice. Good. Very good.
