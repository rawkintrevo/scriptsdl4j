LAFORGE: We've just started it up, Captain. All
systems are holding steady. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Ready when you are, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign Gates, set a course and engage. 
(this time they start to go, and then stop) 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Engineering, report. 
DATA: The warp field has collapsed, sir. 
LAFORGE: It looks like we've blown the entire power converter, Captain.
Impulse engines are down too. We're not going anywhere. But I know just
how to fix this. Give me two, three hours, tops. 
LAFORGE: Now what?

RIKER: Talk about going nowhere fast. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase two nineteen. Advise

(Tyler appears at Geordi's elbow) 
LAFORGE: Tyler, how're you coming with that relay diagnostic?

DATA: It appears Ensign Tyler still has a crush on you. It is clear you

LAFORGE: No, Data, I haven't had the time. Listen, I want you to take

RIKER: What are you waiting for? Answer it. 
(Data removes the telephone receiver from his stomach) 
DATA: Hello? 
FREUD [OC]: Kill them. You must kill them all before it's too late. 
LAFORGE: Data. Data, what's wrong? 
DATA: I do not know.
