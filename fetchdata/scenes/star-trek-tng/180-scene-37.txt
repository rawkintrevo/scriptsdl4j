PICARD RIKER ISHARA LAFORGE WORF

[Corridor]

WORF: I understand you wish to join Starfleet. 
ISHARA: Some day. If I'm lucky. 
WORF: On that day, it is we who will be lucky.

[Transporter room]

(Worf and Ishara enter) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? 
RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Status, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Phasers in alignment and ready to fire. 
PICARD: How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function?

LAFORGE: One point six kilometres. 
PICARD: Fire phasers. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(The beam begins drilling into the planet surface) 
LAFORGE: One point three kilometres. One point four. One point five
kilometres. One point six kilometres. Deep enough for transport, sir. 
PICARD: Cease fire. Mister O'Brien, energise.

[Tunnel]

(The team beam in and move off slowly, weapons
drawn) 
ISHARA: This way. 
WORF: Caution is indicated. 
ISHARA: We're near the heart of the Alliance. Security is minimal here.
They aren't expecting anybody this far in. 
RIKER: Ishara? 
ISHARA: Follow me. 
WORF: Are you certain? 
ISHARA: No, I'm not. I'm trying to remember. I was here, but it was a
long time ago. There have been changes. It's through here. 
(a man is guarding a door) 
ISHARA: There. Your men are behind that door. 
(Riker, Worf and Data move forward. Riker shoots the guard, then he and
Worf phaser open the door)

[Chamber]

RIKER: Hold out your hands. 
(He uses his phaser to undo their handcuffs) 
(Meanwhile, Ishara is heading off somewhere else. She shoots a guard,
but he manages to use his weapon to set off an alarm) 
RIKER: Let's get moving.

[Tunnel]

RIKER: Where is she? 
WORF: Commander, look. 
RIKER: What the hell happened here? 
WORF: She probably tried to draw their fire. It triggered the alarm. 
RIKER: Worf, get these men back to the Enterprise. 
WORF: Come on. 
RIKER: Data, you're with me.
