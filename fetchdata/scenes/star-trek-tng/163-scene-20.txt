RIKER CREWMAN TASHA PICARD GARRETT CASTILLO DATA

[1701-C Bridge]

CASTILLO: Shields are up to seventy two percent.
That's better. 
TASHA: Good. 
GARRETT: Do you believe this Guinan? 
PICARD: I discovered long ago that she has a special wisdom. I've
learned to trust it. I could arrange for you to speak with her if you
wish. 
GARRETT: Captain, I would be lying to you if I told you there was a
chance in hell of coming out of this alive. Why doesn't your ship come
back with us? The Romulans would be no match for your weaponry. 
PICARD: I can't do that. 
GARRETT: No, I suppose not. You don't belong in our time any more than
we belong in yours. To be honest, Picard, a significant number of my
crewmembers have expressed a desire to return, even knowing the odds.
Some because they can't bear to live without their loved ones, some
because they don't like the idea of slipping out in the middle of a
fight. But I have told them that in the here and now, the Federation
needs another ship against the Klingons. And we'd better get used to
being in the here and now. 
PICARD: But if you go back, it could be a great deal more helpful. The
war is going very badly for the Federation, far worse than is generally
known. Starfleet Command believes defeat is inevitable. Within six
months we may have no choice but to surrender. 
GARRETT: And you're saying all this may be a result of our arrival
here? 
PICARD: One more ship will make no difference in the here and now. But
twenty two years ago, one ship could have stopped this war before it
started. 
GARRETT: Mister Castillo. 
CASTILLO: Yes, Captain? 
GARRETT: Inform the crew we're going back. 
CASTILLO: Yes, Captain. 
GARRETT: The Romulans will get a good fight. We'll make it one for the
history books. 
PICARD: I know you will, Captain. Lieutenant Yar? 
TASHA: Permission to remain for a moment, sir. 
PICARD: Granted. 
GARRETT: Transporter room, Captain Picard is ready to return to his
ship. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, Captain. 
TASHA: I just wanted to say good luck. 
CASTILLO: I'll try to put some of your tactical briefing to good use
when we get back. 
TASHA: Your ship has much more manoeuvrability than the Romulan
counterparts of that era. Actually, if you could just isolate... You'll
do fine. 
CASTILLO: If you get back to Earth and you see a man, say, in his late
fifties taking a hard look across a crowded room. Hey, you never know. 
TASHA: Goodbye, Lieutenant. 
(weapons impact. Tasha dives to the ops console and starts working) 
GARRETT: Red Alert! Full power to shields. 
TASHA: Shields are up. Functioning. 
CASTILLO: Initiating evasive manoeuvres. Gamma sequence. 
GARRETT: Ready phasers. Enterprise-D
