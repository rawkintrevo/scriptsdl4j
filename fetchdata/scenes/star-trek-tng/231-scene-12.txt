[Corridor]

LAFORGE: And there's no evidence of an EPS
explosion. 
RIKER: Sensors seemed to think there was. 
LAFORGE: I think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a
pattern recognition failure. 
RIKER: Just a sensor glitch? 
LAFORGE: That's my guess. 
RIKER: Let's perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor
network and make sure that we haven't overlooked anything. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start?
Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours.
I'm having trouble waking up. 
LAFORGE: Sure, Commander. Goodnight. 
RIKER: Goodnight.

down) 
[Corridor]

CREWMAN: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Gordon. 
(Geordi rings a doorbell)

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Who is it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: It's La Forge. 
RIKER: Come in. LAFORGE: Good morning. 
RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. 
LAFORGE: Commander, it's oh seven hundred hours.

MOT: She said, if they're not squirming, we won't
eat 'em! 
(Worf enters) 
MOT: Ah, Mister Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it
is to have you with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today?
Trim your beard? 
WORF: I would like my hair trimmed. 
MOT: Ah. A trim, of course. 
WORF: Not like last time. 
MOT: Oh no, just a little off the top. I took way too much off last
time. I was just telling my colleague, Mister Setti, how thick and
luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes I get
carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the
elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest that you
start using a conditioning agent. 
(Worf sees the scissors and grabs Mot's arm) 
MOT: I promise, not too much off the top. 
(Worf leaves)

[Cargo bay]

(Geordi is up a ladder, looking inside a panel) 
LAFORGE: Just before the grid alarm sounded, we were running warp power
through this junction. Somehow, it must've tripped the internal
scanners. 
RIKER: And it showed up as an EPS explosion? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but the question is, why? I've made modifications to the
sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened. 
(He comes down the ladder) 
RIKER: We can't waste time chasing down sensor ghosts. We should
probably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closer
look. 
LAFORGE: (yawns) Excuse me. 
RIKER: I know the feeling. The past few nights, it seems like as soon
as my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up in the morning. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure we could all use a little shore leave after this
survey's completed. 
RIKER: Definitely. Keep me posted? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. Data, I'm wondering if you could give me a hand. I need
to run a structural integrity scan. I want to make sure that none of
the conduit was 
(Geordi sways) 
DATA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: This is the second time today that my visor's just cut out
like that. 
DATA: Are you all right, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I just had a very weird feeling. Maybe I should
go to Sickbay. 
DATA: I will run the integrity scan. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data.
