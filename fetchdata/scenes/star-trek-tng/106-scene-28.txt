(Then she's back on her home planet, and a rape
gang is after her) 
TASHA: Now, run. This isn't a safe place at all. 
(Someone puts a hand on her shoulder)

[Bridge]

(Tasha jumps) 
LAFORGE: Tasha, what's wrong? You look scared to death. 
TASHA: I was, I was. This is crazy. I was at the colony where I grew
up, being chased by a rape gang 
LAFORGE: Are you all right? Well, you're safe now. 
(Elsewhere on board - a group in period costume is playing Mozart Eine
Kliene Nachtmusik, except for one Starfleet violinist)

[Corridor]

(Picard encounters a man and woman running from
something) 
CREWMAN: Captain! Captain, we need help. 
PICARD: What's wrong? 
CREWMAN: Don't you see what's following us? 
(They carry on running) 
(Picard passes an open door and sees a ballerina in a golden tutu
pirouetting) 
PICARD: Ensign, what are you doing? 
(Her tutu becomes her uniform again) 
(The violinist is sitting at a table, having a meal) 
(Picard turns a corner and meets an elderly woman sitting at a tea
table) 
MAMAN: (french accent) You look tense, Jean-Luc. Come and have a cup of
tea. 
PICARD: Maman? 
MAMAN: I'll make it good and strong, the way you like it. We will have
a nice long talk. 
PICARD: This can't be. You've been 
MAMAN: Dead? But I'm always with you, you know that. 
PICARD: Yes, I've felt that. But why now, suddenly. 
MAMAN: You mean out here? At what you say us the end of the universe?
Or do you see this as the beginning of it? 
PICARD: We believe it the outer rim. Maman, do you understand these
things? Can you tell me where my ship is? What is this place? 
RIKER: Captain? You were reported headed for 
PICARD: Just a moment, Number One! 
(But the corridor is empty now) 
RIKER: Can I help you, sir? 
PICARD: No. No, let's help all of us. (goes to comm. panel) General
quarters. Red Alert.

[Engineering]

(Crusher is examining the Traveller, who is lying
on a padded bench) 
ARGYLE: What is it Captain? Why are we at General quarters? 
PICARD: I had to get everyone's attention. It was the quickest way.
This is the Captain. This is not a drill. It seems that in this place,
the world of the physical universe and the world of ideas is somehow
intermixed. What we think 
[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Also becomes a reality. We must,
therefore, I repeat, must begin controlling our thoughts.

[Corridor]

PICARD [OC]: We will give you more on this as our
understanding increases. The Enterprise will stay at full alert until
the crisis is over.

[Engineering]

PICARD: (to Kosinski) What did you do? 
RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant. 
PICARD: What are you talking about? 
RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments. 
KOSINSKI: It was me! 
RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought. 
KOSINSKI: I honestly thought it was me. I thought somehow, somehow I
was operating on his level. 
ARGYLE: It's also my fault, Captain. I should have realised it wasn't
Kosinski. 
PICARD: How could you? How could any of us? 
RIKER: Wesley did. 
PICARD: If you knew something, why didn't you say so? 
RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen. 
PICARD: He's unconscious. Why? 
CRUSHER: I'm not certain yet. 
WESLEY: He phased, sir. 
PICARD: What does that mean? 
WESLEY: Parts of him disappeared and then came back. Nobody else was
paying attention to him the first time.
RIKER: When we saw it this time, he seemed to be struggling, fighting
it. 
CRUSHER: He's dying. 
PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. 
CRUSHER: Realistically, it does not seem possible.

Captain's log, supplemental. Our position is
unknown, and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a
dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology
sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in
caring for him.
