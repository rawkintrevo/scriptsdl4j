P2 PICARD RIKER [OC]
self drive entity talking wrong unable want fight mean

[Corridor]

PICARD: You made a decision to leave the ship? 
P2: I must. 
PICARD: Why? 
P2: The energy in the vortex wants me. 
PICARD: You're certain. 
P2: Yes. It's an entity, a life form, which recognises the Enterprise
as an entity with me as its brain. And it wants me.

[Turbolift]

P2: Shuttlebay two. 
PICARD: What's your other option? 
P2: This is our only chance. If I leave, it may be distracted long
enough for the Enterprise to escape. 
PICARD: You're wrong. If you leave, the Enterprise will be destroyed.
Don't you remember? You saw it happen. 
P2: If I don't leave the ship, then the Enterprise will be destroyed.

[Corridor]

PICARD: If that's true, then help me. We want the
same thing. We both want the Enterprise to be safe. But there is a
piece of information I don't have. What is it? 
P2: It's me. 
PICARD: You? 
RIKER [OC]: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes. 
RIKER [OC]: We are about to lose warp drive. 
PICARD: Understood. 
P2: Understood. 
[Shuttlebay two]

PICARD: When you say it wants you, do you mean it's
still you, only you, and not me. 
P2: You're confusing me. We're almost out of time. I must get to the
shuttle. 
PICARD: Wait. You can. I'll let you. But first, tell me. What is, what
was your other choice? 
P2: Stand aside. 
PICARD: You must tell me. What was it? You don't know what I'm talking
about. You're locked into a single intent unable to change. Unable to
alter any part of your previous actions. 
P2: I have to leave. There's no other way. 
PICARD: There must be. 
P2: One. But it would never work. 
PICARD: What is it? What would never work? 
P2: I have to leave. 
PICARD: What was the other choice? We can't fight, we can't escape, we
can't go forward. 
P2: No. No, we can't go forward. That would destroy the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Was that it? Is that the other choice? 
P2: I must leave. 
PICARD: No. (grabs a phaser) Captain Picard. I can not allow you to
leave. Before we can go forward, the cycle must end. 
(So he shoots his other self) 
PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, report to Shuttlebay two.
