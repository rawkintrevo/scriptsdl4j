RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Progress, Number One? 
RIKER: No one's seen him. The replicator in his quarters has not been
used. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, check hull and shield integrity for any sign of
intruders. 
WORF: Yes, sir, but I have been closely monitoring all on-board
sensors. There has been no indication that any 
PICARD: Then give me a Level One diagnostic of any onboard sensors, and
run a manual sweep of any anomalous airborne or electromagnetic
readings. I want some answers.

[Engineering]

WESLEY: I've been experimenting with Kosinski's
warp field equations, trying to improve engine efficiency. 
PICARD: I've read your reports. 
LAFORGE: We did a test run while we were still at the starbase. Here's
what the computer recorded. 
WESLEY: This is the static warp field we created inside the warp drive.
The experiment was designed to see if we could keep a bubble like this
intact. 
LAFORGE: As you'll see in a moment, we couldn't. 
LAFORGE: There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the
spectrum. 
CRUSHER: I remember that. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting that a bubble could have made Doctor Quaice
disappear? 
WESLEY: If he were caught in it, yes, sir, it would seem to us like
he'd disappeared. 
CRUSHER: Where would he go? 
LAFORGE: Who knows. He could even end up outside of our space time
continuum. 
PICARD: Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering during your experiment? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. 
PICARD: And the bubble never expanded beyond Engineering? 
WESLEY: No, sir. 
PICARD: Then how could it have trapped Doctor Quaice or the others? 
LAFORGE: There are others missing? 
CRUSHER: Yes, and they weren't anywhere near Engineering. 
WESLEY: It doesn't make sense. 
PICARD: I doubt the warp bubble could alter computer records, or erase
memories. Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La Forge. It's our only working
theory for now.

PICARD: Has something else happened? 
CRUSHER: Sickbay is totally empty. Apparently I no longer have any
staff. 
RIKER: And that surprises you, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Surprises me? I'll say it surprises me. There should be at
least four members of my staff on duty at all times. 
DATA: I am afraid ship's records do not concur. Doctor. 
CRUSHER: What are you talking about? 
DATA: You do not have a staff. 
CRUSHER: You're telling me I'm the sole medical officer on a ship with
over a thousand people on board? 
DATA: Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire ship's complement is two
hundred and thirty. 
CRUSHER: What? 
PICARD: Doctor, may I see you in my Ready room?
