[Ten Forward]

PICARD: Our guests will be moving shortly to cargo
bay four, where the transport will occur. I want you to ensure them of
safe passage between Ten Forward to the cargo bay. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Understood, Captain. Doctor. Mister La
Forge. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: Transporter controls are being
transferred. Ten Forward to Bridge. I said all transporter controls.
Including those aboard all your shuttlecraft.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Almost had them, Ensign. Nice try. Ten
Forward. Our mistake. Remaining transporter functions are being
transferred to you.

[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: Once we create our own access code, we can
prevent anyone using the transporter against us. We can go to the cargo
bay. 
DATA: What about the weapons? 
TROI: We will each take a hostage for protection. 
DATA: Klingon. 
TROI: Picard, you are mine. 
KEIKO: Please, let her stay. 
(Miles lets Keiko hand Molly over to the woman again) 
TROI: Lower the forcefield.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Security teams, stand by. 
RO: They're heading through section five. 
[Deck 10 Corridor]

(Past the watchful eyes of security guards, the
group get into a turbolift)

[Bridge]

RIKER: Mister La Forge, Doctor, they'll be at their
destination in less than a minute. 
RO: They've stopped at deck eighteen, sir. 
RIKER: Security, allow them access into cargo bay four. 
SECURITY [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Cargo bay]

O'BRIEN: I will require assistance. 
PICARD: Captain Shumar, how do you intend to achieve this rest that you
so desire? 
TROI: What do you mean? 
PICARD: Well, how do you intend to free yourselves of this existence
that has so trapped your consciousness? 
TROI: It will fade as we move further from this planet. 
PICARD: Really? What is your scientific basis for that? 
TROI: I don't need a scientific basis. Just be quiet. 
PICARD: Captain Shumar, when are you going to tell me who you really
are? 
O'BRIEN: I've initialised the transporter signal. 
TROI: Proceed.
