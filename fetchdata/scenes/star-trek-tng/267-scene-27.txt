doctor chair blackjack unfairly ready senior bye tomorrow mean

[Riker's quarters]

LAFORGE: The Commander's flush is still working. No
help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. And Jacks and fours for the
Counsellor. Ah, three sixes. 
WORF: Fold. 
RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking. Give me a second, here. 
TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the
officer's game at the Potemkin? 
RIKER: I happen to like poker. 
TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to
ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were
young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. 
RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. 
WORF: I do not believe he is bluffing. 
LAFORGE: I do. There you go. What've you got? 
WORF: Flush. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe this. 
RIKER: I am your worst nightmare.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(Lavelle has sevens and sixes, and a queen) 
BEN: I knew it. 
LAVELLE: How could you tell I was bluffing? 
BEN: You don't really expect me to answer that, do you? 
SITO: Look, it's getting late. Maybe we should all get some sleep. 
BEN: One more hand. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit just
because I'm unbeatable? 
LAFORGE: Nah, there's something I need to do down in Engineering. I'll
get you next time. 
RIKER: I'll be there. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight, everybody. 
TROI + CRUSHER: Goodnight. 
[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

SITO: Bye. 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
OGAWA: See you later. 
(Sito and Ogawa leave) 
TAURIK: What I find curious is that when Commander La Forge saw that
the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed
annoyed. 
BEN: Of course he was. 
LAVELLE: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't. 
TAURIK: Do you think I have irreparably damaged my relationship with
him? 
LAVELLE: It depends on what kind of a guy he is. 
BEN: Ante up, gentlemen. 
(doorbell) LAVELLE: Come in. 
(La Forge enters) 
LAVELLE: Commander. 
LAFORGE: As you were. I just dropped by to see Taurik. 
TAURIK: What can I do for you, sir? 
LAFORGE: Well, I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests on the
nacelles. Since you've already put in some work on the technique, I
thought you might like to give me a hand. 
TAURIK: I'd be pleased to, sir. 
LAFORGE: Great. Let's go. 
(La Forge and Taurik leave) 
BEN: How about some blackjack? 
LAVELLE: I've got to get some sleep so I can be sharp tomorrow. 
BEN: Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have
to get to sleep even earlier? 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come in. 
CRUSHER: Ben. What are you doing here? 
BEN: I just cleaned out some junior officers and I thought I'd do the
same here. 
RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try. 
TROI: Pull up a chair. 
BEN: Thanks. 
[Gymnasium]

(a martial arts class has just finished) 
WORF: Dismissed. Ensign Sito. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
WORF: I also teach an advanced class. I believe you may be ready to
participate. However, before you can join the group, you must pass the
gik'tal. 
SITO: Gik'tal? 
WORF: Yes. It is a very ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge
of the forms of the mok'bara. 
SITO: I should practice first. 
WORF: No. No practise. That is part of the ritual. The test must be
unannounced. 
(Worf blindfolds her) 
WORF: Can you see? 
SITO: No. 
WORF: Good. The gik'tal has begun. Defend yourself. 
(of course, he easily throws her) 
WORF: You must anticipate my attack. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
WORF: Defend yourself. 
(once again, she has no idea where he is before she lands on her back) 
WORF: Are you listening, Ensign? 
SITO: Yes, but 
WORF: Defend yourself. 
(and a third time) 
WORF: You did not anticipate. 
(Sito removes the blindfold) 
SITO: How am I supposed to defend myself when I can't see a thing? 
WORF: Stop making excuses. Replace the blindfold. 
SITO: No. It's not a fair test. 
WORF: Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge. 
SITO: What? By taking off the blindfold? 
WORF: It takes courage to say the test is unfair. 
SITO: One thing I don't understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death? 
WORF: You speak Klingon. 
SITO: Sir, is there really such a thing as a gik'tal challenge? 
WORF: No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly,
it will not take so many bruises for you protest.
