PICARD ROBERT CRUSHER TROI

[Vineyard]

(Robert is tasting the red grapes, making sure they
are all right) 
ROBERT: So, you arrived all right. Welcome home, Captain. 
PICARD: Hello, Robert. 
ROBERT: You've shuttled in from the village? 
PICARD: No I decided to walk. I met Marie and Rene. 
ROBERT: Good. Good. 
PICARD: It's good to see you. 
ROBERT: Are you tired? 
PICARD: No. 
ROBERT: Make yourself at home. You know where everything is. We
generally eat about eight. I must try and cure this poor, sick vine.
I'll see you shortly. 
[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: So, you'll have a chance to visit the
surface? 
TROI: Maybe. Will and I have been talking about going back to Angel
Falls. 
CRUSHER: Oh, Venezuela's beautiful. 
(doorbell) 
CRUSHER: Come in. 
(A crewman enters with a box. Beverly takes it) 
CRUSHER: Great. Thank you. 
(When she opens it we see the label - Lt Cmdr Jack R Crusher, USS
Stargazer NCC 2893) 
TROI: Something from home? 
CRUSHER: I left it here in storage a long time ago after Jack died.
Odds and ends, mostly. 
TROI: (reading a book title) How to Advance Your Career through
Marriage? 
CRUSHER: It was a joke. Jack sent it to me while I was still in medical
school. It was his way of proposing to me. 
TROI: What's that? 
CRUSHER: It's for Wesley, from Jack. I'd forgotten it. Maybe I was just
trying to forget it. 
TROI: Why? 
CRUSHER: Jack recorded a holographic message to Wesley just after he
was born. It was a gift for when he grew up. Jack was going to make
many more of them. He never had the chance. 
TROI: Are you afraid of what it might say? 
CRUSHER: No, I just don't know if it'll do more harm than good.
Wesley's finally come to terms with his father's death. 
TROI: Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that you
can't answer for him. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand.
