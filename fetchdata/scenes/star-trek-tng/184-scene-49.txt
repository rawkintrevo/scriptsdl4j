TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER ALLENBY DATA

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Data, we're picking up frequencies across
the entire electromagnetic and lower subspace spectrum. Trying to
isolate. Data, can you focus the reflector field for me? 
DATA [OC]: Stand by. 
[Bridge]

DATA: I am differentiating particle-emission
signatures now. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Good. Good, that's doing it. Patterns are
converging. 
[Bridge]

ALLENBY: Same course, same speed. No change, sir. 
WORF: We are beginning to encounter the gravitational effects of the
string. Impact is in four minutes. 
DATA: Sir, shear force turbulence is impairing our ability to create an
accurate simulation. 
RIKER: Geordi, fire up the impulse engines. Activate the 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Ship's stabilisers. 
LAFORGE: Stabilisers on.

[Bridge]

DATA: Electromagnetic and subspace wave fronts
approaching synchronisation.
WORF: Three minutes to impact. 
RIKER: Status? 
ALLENBY: The cluster is unaffected. Same course, same speed. 
PICARD: Let's try turning up the volume. Increase the intensity, Mister
Data. 
DATA: Increasing by fifty percent. 
ALLENBY: They're slowing. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Graviton-wake field collapsing. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, get us out of here. 
LAFORGE [OC]: With pleasure, sir.
ALLENBY: The beings have resumed their course into the string. Three
seconds to impact. 
(Deanna stands up and gasps) 
TROI: It's all right. They're home. We were wrong. The cosmic string it
was never dangerous to them. It was the one place in the galaxy they
most wanted to be. 
RIKER: Deanna? 
TROI: Yes. I sensed it.
