TROI OBRIEN LAFORGE WORF PULASKI WESLEY COMPUTER DATA

[Holodeck]

(A forbidding setting, lit with red light. There is
a channel between two raised platforms) 
DATA: Computer, is this it? 
COMPUTER: Correct. Klingon Rite of Ascension Chamber. 
LAFORGE: Is this really necessary? 
WESLEY: If we want to get Worf through his problem, it is. 
DATA: Computer, please give us Klingon personnel appropriate to this
event. 
(Four warriors stand on each side of the channel, with metre-long
painstiks) 
DATA: These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites. 
LAFORGE: Cute bunch. 
WESLEY: And they use those? 
O'BRIEN: Those are Klingon painstiks. I once saw one of them used
against a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor creature jumped five metres at
the slightest touch. It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures.

WESLEY: You mean? 
O'BRIEN: That's right. The animal's head exploded like 
PULASKI: I think that's enough, Chief O'Brien. 
[Corridor]

WORF: I do not enjoy riddles, Counsellor. 
TROI: You will enjoy this one. 
WORF: I am in no mood for trifling or games, not today. 
TROI: I know what an important day this is for you, the anniversary of
your Rite of Ascension. 
WORF: You know about that? 
TROI: All your friends on board do. 
WORF: That is impossible. It is a secret known only to Klingons. 
TROI: And certain resourceful young Ensigns. 
WORF: Wesley Crusher. What does he know about it? 
TROI: Just bear with me. 
WORF: Where are we going? 
TROI: The holodeck. 
WORF: This is truly trying my patience, Counsellor. 
TROI: I think you will approve. 
WORF: You're not coming in? 
TROI: No. 
WORF: Open.

[Holodeck] 
WORF: An Ascension ceremony. 
LAFORGE: Happy anniversary, Worf. 
DATA: Shall we begin? 
WORF: I am ready. 
(He steps between the two lines of warriors) 
WORF: DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH. tIgwIj Sa'angNIS. 'Iw bIQtIqDaq jIjaH.
Today I am a Warrior. I must show you my heart. I travel the river of
blood. 
(The first two warriors apply their painstiks to his sides, and he
screams in pain) 
DATA: The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profound
feelings while under extreme duress. 
WORF: jIbechrup may' vIlos. 
(The second pair apply their painstiks) 
WORF: The battle is mine. I crave only the blood of the enemy.
HIHIvqa'. 
(Third pair. He falls to his knees and O'Brien holds Pulaski back) 
WORF: The bile of the vanquished flows over my hands. May'pequ' moH. 
(The fourth and final pair use their painstiks twice and he collapses
in front of his 'family') 
WORF: Thank you.
