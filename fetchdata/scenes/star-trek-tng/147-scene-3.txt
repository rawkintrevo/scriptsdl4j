RIKER KOLRAMI LAFORGE PICARD PULASKI DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD:
Well, Number One, you
are allowed a complement
of forty, so select whom you
will, save of course Mister Data,
who will serve as my
first officer during your
absence. 
KOLRAMI:
I had envisioned you defining the crew. 
PICARD: On my ship, the leader of an away team has total control of the
mission. If you want to judge leadership, why not start at the
beginning? 
KOLRAMI: Very well, Captain. 
(Kolrami leaves)
PULASKI: My, what a charmer. 
PICARD: Doctor. 
PULASKI: Captain, he needs an attitude adjustment. 
DATA: The Zakdornian culture is replete with self-assuredness and
confidence. Seldom is it undeserved. For example, Kolrami is a third
level grand master at the game of Strategema.

are being made
to something on the warp
core.) 
LAFORGE:
Another millimetre. That's it. A little more. There. That's
excellent. 
RIKER: Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. 
RIKER: You've heard of the simulation aboard the Hathaway? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and the best of luck to you. I've researched the old
Avidyne engines. They're archaic by our standards, very touchy. 
(The first of many Buckaroo Banzai references in this story) 
RIKER: Anticipating the worst, do you think they can be whipped into
shape in forty eight hours? 
LAFORGE: I've already taken the liberty of putting together a few
necessities.
