LAFORGE: Thanks, Ensign. Hey, Wes! There you are. Come here for a
second. I've got something I want to show you. Come on, come on. You've
got to take a look at this. Now, remember how we always used to talk
about improving quantum efficiency by creating a new plasmadyne relay?
Well, take a look at this. 
WESLEY: You've only got one microfusion interrelay in there? Your
converter interface'll never hold up. 
LAFORGE: Hey, I ran these diagnostics myself. This little baby will
withstand over five hundred Cochranes of warp field stress. 
WESLEY: I don't think so. You better put a secondary phase inverter in
there. Look at your subprocessor matrix. It needs an overhaul. 
LAFORGE: Well, that may be your opinion, Cadet, but I stand by my work.

WESLEY: Read the latest paper from Doctor Vassbinder. He has brilliant
new theories on warp propulsion inter-relays. He's say all this stuff
is obsolete. 
LAFORGE: I don't know what's gotten into you, Wes. 
WESLEY: Look, do you want my help or not? 
LAFORGE: With this kind of an attitude, absolutely not. You're
dismissed. 
Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise has
arrived at Dorvan Five and I have spoken to the Leader of the Tribal
Council. He has agreed to meet with us this afternoon to discuss the
situation.
