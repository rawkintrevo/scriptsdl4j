PICARD RIKER RO DATA WORF

[Corridor]

RO: Captain. 
PICARD: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. 
RO: Well, to tell you the truth, I really want to see everyone. I'd
just rather do it one at a time. 
PICARD: You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agree
with you. 
RO: You know me, I enjoy a challenge. 
PICARD: That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes out
every year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. 
RO: Captain, I want you to know that I really appreciate your
recommending me. If it weren't for you, my life would be a very
different one right now. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're receiving a distress signal from a
Cardassian ship near the Demilitarised Zone.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Change course to intercept. I'm on my way.
I'd like you at the conn, Lieutenant.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign Gates. 
(Gates gives up her seat for Ro) 
PICARD: Report. 
RIKER: The Cardassian ship relayed a distress signal but it was cut off
before we could find out what was wrong. 
RO: I have the ship on long range sensors. It appears to be under
attack by several small ships. 
PICARD: Can you identify them? 
RO: No, sir. They're not transmitting identification codes. 
DATA: I will scan their warp signatures. Sir, sensors indicate the
attacking vessels are Federation ships. 
(after the opening credits) 
RO: We're coming into visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER: Those are Federation ships. 
PICARD: Isolate one and magnify. The Maquis. Open a channel. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: To all Maquis ships. Call off your attack or we will be forced
to engage you. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: You are Federation citizens. Your actions are in violation of
our treaty with the Cardassians. Call off your attack. 
DATA: They are not responding, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, are we in firing range? 
WORF: Not yet, sir. 
PICARD: Arm phasers and photon torpedoes and stand by. 
RIKER: I never thought we'd be firing on our own people to protect a
Cardassian ship. 
DATA: The Maquis ships are regrouping, sir. They are closing in on the
Cardassian vessel. 
WORF: The Cardassian's shields are down to thirty percent. 
RIKER: They may not be able to withstand another hit. 
WORF: Sir, we are within weapons range. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, can you detonate a torpedo spread between the
Maquis ships and the Cardassians? 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Do it. 
(four bolts of light whoosh off) 
WORF: The Maquis are breaking formation. They are withdrawing. 
PICARD: Signal the Cardassians that we're standing by to assist them if
they have any wounded. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
