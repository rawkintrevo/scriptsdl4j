bar century picard couple theft ask senator piano teach

[Romulan street]

PARDEK: So, what do you think of your enemy,
Captain Picard?
PICARD: These people are no one's enemy, Senator.
PARDEK: Many of my colleagues fear what they have to say. But I have
learned to listen carefully. Children like D'Tan are our future. Old
men like me will not be able to hold on to ancient prejudice and
hostility. Young people won't allow it. But now, now that they've met
their first real Vulcan, it has only inspired them more. I am sure that
is evident to you, Spock. 
SPOCK: I did not anticipate such a passionate response to my arrival.
PARDEK: Romulans are passionate people. The Vulcans will learn to
appreciate that quality in us.
SPOCK: If we are successful.
PARDEK: We will know soon. The Proconsul has agreed to meet with you.

First Officer's log, stardate 45245.8. The
Enterprise remains at Qualor Two as we continue to investigate the
theft of a surplus Vulcan ship. The trail has led us to the former wife
of a deceased smuggler.

[Piano bar]

(Riker takes a drink from the tray of a Zakdorn
waiter, and goes over to a large, four-armed lady piano player) 
AMARIE: A new face.
RIKER: Same one I've always had.
AMARIE: And what would you like to hear?
RIKER: Know some blues?
AMARIE: Look at me, Mister. What do you think? Seven different shades
of them. How about some Andorian blues? Suck salt?
RIKER: Never cared for it.
AMARIE: Good for you. Nasty habit. So who are you looking for?
RIKER: Who says I'm looking for anybody?
AMARIE: Your face. Your uniform. In a place like this.
RIKER: Okay. I'm looking for you.
AMARIE: Oh, you just made my day.
RIKER: I have to ask you about your husband.
AMARIE: Well, it was nice while it lasted. Which husband?
RIKER: The dead one, I'm afraid.
AMARIE: Oh, you must be from the Enterprise. You destroyed his ship.
RIKER: He was into some bad business. He took the evidence with him.
AMARIE: His one endearing quality, he always cleaned up after himself.
And what do you want from me?
RIKER: I was hoping you might know his business partners.
AMARIE: And why should I help you?
RIKER: To be honest, I can't think of a good reason.
AMARIE: Well, you did kill my ex-husband, and that's not a bad start.
So why don't you drop a few coins in the jar and I'll see what I
remember.
RIKER: I don't carry money.
AMARIE: Well, you don't offer much, do you?
RIKER: Move over.
AMARIE: Oh, just what I need. Another set of hands.
RIKER: You know this one? Twentieth century, Earth. Maybe I can teach
you a lick or two.
AMARIE: You already have.
RIKER: So, what do you say?
AMARIE: You going to be around for a couple of days?
RIKER: I can be.
AMARIE: Sooner or later, a man named Omag will come by for a song.
Always wants to hear the same thing, Melor Famagal. (she shudders) He's
an arms trader. A fat Ferengi.
