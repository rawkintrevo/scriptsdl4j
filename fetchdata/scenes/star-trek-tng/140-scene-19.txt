TROI OBRIEN LAFORGE RIKER WESLEY DATA

[Engineering]

O'BRIEN: Find anything yet? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. 
DATA: There is nothing to find. 
O'BRIEN: No harm in checking, I guess. 
LAFORGE: Really? How would you like them to give the transporter
operation a little once-over? 
O'BRIEN: No problem. We're totally ship-shape. 
LAFORGE: You're missing the point. It's just the idea that they even
suspect a malfunction. 
DATA: If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I would
find this entire procedure insulting. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data. 
(Another part of Engineering, where Wesley is talking to Guy) 
WESLEY: Chief, will you be able to attend a little party for Lieutenant
Worf at seventeen hundred hours? 
O'BRIEN: A party for Worf? Sounds intriguing. I'd be delighted. 
WESLEY: It's a surprise. 
O'BRIEN: My lips are sealed.

[Troi's office]

RIKER: I didn't want to leave without saying
good-bye. 
TROI: I don't like good-byes. How about, until next time? 
RIKER: How about until next time. 
TROI: It's been a pleasure serving with you, Commander. 
RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. 
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels but, I can't read you
right now. 
RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. 
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. 
RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. 
TROI: Are you feeling sad? 
RIKER: Yes, I am. 
TROI: So am I. 
(She falls into his arms, weeping)
