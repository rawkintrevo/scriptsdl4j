RIKER: Enterprise to Stargazer, please respond.
Enterprise to Captain Picard aboard Stargazer. Please answer. Mister
Data, what was Stargazer's condition? 
DATA: Considerable fire damage to interior surface reported, sir. But
none of her main systems were crippled. 
RIKER: Armaments, Lieutenant Yar? 
TASHA: Six photon torpedoes short, sir, probably used when the Captain
destroyed his Ferengi attackers nine years ago. Otherwise fully armed. 
(Geordi is examining the globe device from the chest) 
RIKER: What do you make of it, La Forge? 
LAFORGE: It seems to be a network of miniature circuitry, sir.
Incredibly complex. Maybe an amplifier. 
RIKER: Where was it in the Captain's quarters, Mister Worf? 
WORF: His chest from the Stargazer, sir? Just where I had left it. He
hadn't yet unpacked. 
CRUSHER: So, he may not have even known it was there. And if this is
able to pick up or magnify thought-altering transmissions 
TROI: It could have prepared him for whatever is happening now. 
RIKER: Let's find out, or try to. Contact the Ferengi vessel,
Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
RIKER: Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we transmit visually. Do you
respond? 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: Why is our gift to you under power, human? 
RIKER: I will discuss that with your captain. 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: He is working in our ship's laboratory. Where
is your Captain? 
RIKER: He's beamed himself aboard the Stargazer, and I'm wondering if
this has something to do with it. 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: How do you have possession of that? 
RIKER: It was found in our Captain's chest, which brought over from the
Stargazer. 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: It is a forbidden device. A thought maker. If
your Captain is criminal enough to own one 
RIKER: Kazago, you know who controls those spheres. Now I ask you
again, First Officer to First Officer. What's going on? 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: It is not seemly to question one's own DaiMon,
Riker. I am not prepared to do that. 
TASHA: Sir, I have the Stargazer. 
RIKER: Switch, now! Enterprise to Picard. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Do not attack again! We are on a peaceful
mission. Give your identity. You force us to defend ourselves. Phasers
full up. Arm torpedoes. Why aren't the shields at full power? 
TASHA: We've lost him, sir. 
LAFORGE: When he put up the shields, sir.

[Stargazer Bridge]

(Picard is surrounded by the ghosts of his crew,
and the flames) 
PICARD: Damn, I said put fusion generators under surge control. You're
moving too slowly. Arm the torpedoes, man!
Vigo! Get a fire control party up here! 
VOICES [OC]: Shields weakening, Captain! Fusion generator online. 
PICARD: Weapons report! 
VOICE [OC]: Phasers coming to full charge, sir. Torpedoes armed! 
PICARD: Who are they? Identify them! 
VOICE [OC]: They're coming for a third pass at us, sir! 
VOICE [OC]: We can't take another hit, Captain!

[Bridge]

TROI: Sir, I now feel anger from our Captain. Fury
over whatever it is he is reliving out there. 
LAFORGE: The Battle of Maxia, sir. That's what it is. 
RIKER: The Picard Manoeuvre. What is the defence against that, Data? 
DATA: There is no defence, sir. 
RIKER: Then devise one, fast! 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: First Officer Kazago to human Riker. 
RIKER: Not now, Kazago. 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: We do not wish to become involved in what has
become clearly a Federation matter. 
RIKER: Fine, fine, Enterprise out! 
KAZAGO [on viewscreen]: You should also know that DaiMon Bok no longer
commands this vessel. His First Officer has confined him for engaging
in this unprofitable venture. Good luck, First Officer Riker. 
DATA: I have computed a possibility, Commander. Since even deep space
contains trace gases, sir, a vessel in the Picard manoeuvre might seem
to disappear, but our sensors could locate any sudden compression of
those gases. 
RIKER: And use it as an aiming point and blow our Captain to bits? 
DATA: This class starship has enough power to use our tractor beam on
it. Seize it, limit it's field of fire. 
RIKER: Right. Concentrate shields at that point. Make it so. I hope
you're right, Data. 
DATA: No question of it, sir. 
RIKER: Stand by! 
(Stargazer suddenly appears to be in two places at once) 
RIKER: Lock on tractor beam. 
(And the Stargazer is held)

[Stargazer Bridge]

PICARD: Ready phasers. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain Picard, listen to me. 
PICARD: Vigo, is that you? 
RIKER [OC]: It's Commander Riker, sir! 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Captain, hear me! Look around you, the Ferengi
are using their thought devices on you. 
PICARD: Stand by. Who is this? 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: It's Riker, sir. Your Number One. Look for a
silver sphere. Destroy it with your phaser. 
PICARD: Phaser. A sphere. Bok used it. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Destroy it! 
PICARD: Phaser. Destroy the sphere. Destroy the sphere. 
(After some hesitation, Picard destroys the sphere. The resulting
explosion throws him across the Bridge)

RIKER: Are you all right, Captain?
