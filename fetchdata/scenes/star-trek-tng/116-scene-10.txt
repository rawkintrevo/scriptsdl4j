RIKER: You look like you're packing to leave
forever. 
CRUSHER: Oh, Commander Riker. No, I'm just gathering my notes.
Professor Terence Epstein is at this starbase. 
RIKER: Is that someone I should know of? 
CRUSHER: He's the leading mind in cybernetics. He lectured at my
medical school. You know the disaster at Micromius? 
[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Well, since then I've been working on an
approach that combines cybernetics and regeneration. It sounds
impossible, I know, but I have found an approach which will work. I
mean, what an opportunity. To have a chance to talk with Doctor
Epstein. Sorry, Will, I'd love to chat, but I have to go.
