DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Bridge. 
DATA: It has been quite a day, has it not? 
PICARD: Yes, it has. 
DATA: However, a change of routine is often invigorating and can be a
welcome diversion after a long assignment. 
PICARD: Exactly. 
DATA: I understand that Arkaria has some very interesting weather
patterns. 
PICARD: Mister Data, are you all right? 
DATA: Yes, sir. I am attempting to fill a silent moment with
non-relevant conversation. 
PICARD: Small talk. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I have found that humans often use small talk during
awkward moments. Therefore, I have written a new subroutine for that
purpose. How did I do? 
PICARD: Perhaps it was a little too non-relevant. But if you really are
interested in small talk, then you should keep your eye on Commander
Hutchinson at the reception this afternoon. He's a master. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. I will.

LAFORGE: Captain. 
WORF: Captain. 
(they speak over each other) 
WORF: After you, sir. 
LAFORGE: No, after you. 
WORF: No sir. I believe you spoke first. 
PICARD: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we're running out of time. Mister Worf? 
WORF: The computer needs your authorisation to disable command
functions during the baryon sweep. 
PICARD: Are we ready, Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Almost. I've requested two additional field diverters. One for
the computer core and one for the Bridge. They haven't been installed
yet. 
PICARD: Additional units? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. We've logged in five years more warp hours than most
ships do in ten, so our baryon particle levels are high. I'm a little
concerned that when the Remmler Array starts to sweep the ship it'll
have to use a stronger beam than normal in order to get rid of all the
radiation. 
PICARD: And that might overload the field diverters protecting our key
systems. How long until the new ones are in place? 
LAFORGE: I'd say about twenty minutes. 
PICARD: Very well. Computer, disable all command functions in thirty
minutes. Authorisation, Picard gamma six zero seven three. 
COMPUTER: Authorisation acknowledged. 
WORF: Captain, incoming message. It's the station administrator, Mister
Orton. 
PICARD: In my Ready room, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Captain. Request permission to be excused from Commander
Hutchinson's reception. 
PICARD: Permission granted. I wish I could excuse myself as well. 
LAFORGE: Captain, permission to be 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, I cannot excuse my entire senior staff. Mister
Worf beat you to it.
