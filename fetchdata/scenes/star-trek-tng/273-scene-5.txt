KMTAR WORF

[Worf's quarters]

K'MTAR: I will send Kurn a message telling him what
happened, but he will not receive
it for days. He's gone to the Hitora colony 
WORF: Why did you treat Commander Riker so disrespectfully? You were
rude. 
K'MTAR: I may have been rude by human standards. I meant no disrespect.
What is the matter, Worf? Have you been living so long among humans
that you have forgotten how Klingons behave? 
WORF: I have not forgotten. I am merely stating that their ways our
different than ours. 
K'MTAR: I trust you have made your son aware of that fact as well. 
WORF: Yes, of course I have. 
K'MTAR: Good. Because someday Alexander may be called upon to lead the
house of Mogh. Kurn has no male heir. He wants to make sure that
Alexander is preparing himself. 
WORF: Does my brother doubt my ability to raise my son as a Klingon? 
K'MTAR: No. But you are alone among humans. It cannot be easy to keep
our ways. 
WORF: No. It has not been easy. 
K'MTAR: How are his fighting skills? Can he handle a bat'leth? 
WORF: He is learning. He could be better. 
K'MTAR: He must. He's nearing the age of ascension. 
WORF: Actually, Alexander has not yet committed himself to undergoing
the Rite. 
K'MTAR: What? 
WORF: I have tried to explain to him how important it is, but he will
not listen to me. 
K'MTAR: Perhaps together, you and I can find a way to spark the boy's
interest in his heritage. 
WORF: I would be grateful for any help you could offer. 
K'MTAR: Tomorrow, then. 
WORF: Tomorrow. 
K'MTAR: May I say goodnight to the boy? 
WORF: Yes, of course.
