PICARD TROI DATA RIKER WORF

[Turbolift]

DATA: Would either of you mind if I made a personal
inquiry? 
TROI: Personal inquiry? No, go right ahead. 
DATA: I am perceiving an apparent change in the way others behave
toward me. For example, people abruptly end conversations when I
appear, just as you did when the turbolift doors opened. Is that an
accurate observation? 
RIKER: Not at all. 
TROI: (same time) Yes. 
RIKER: Yes. 
TROI: You're right, Data. And it's not a very nice thing to do. 
RIKER: It's just that our mental pathways have become accustomed to
your sensory input patterns. 
DATA: I understand. I am also fond of you, Commander. And you as well,
Counsellor.

RIKER: We're in orbit. 
PICARD: Any sign of life? 
WORF: Negative, sir. 
DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up an unusual temporal disturbance
on a small area of the planet's surface. Forty two degrees seven
minutes north by eighty eight degrees declination east. 
RIKER: Temporal disturbance? 
PICARD: Put us in a standard orbit above those coordinates. 
DATA: Spectral analysis shows a high level of triolic waves emanating
from the same location. 
RIKER: Any correlation with the readings from Earth? 
DATA: Affirmative, sir. The magnetic signature is identical to the one
found in the cavern. 
PICARD: Would these triolic waves be dangerous to humanoids? 
DATA: Only with long term exposure, sir. There is no immediate threat. 
PICARD: Take an away team. 
RIKER: Worf. Geordi. Troi. Join me in transporter room three for an
away team. 
DATA: Commander. 
PICARD: Mister Data, I'll need your help to monitor the sensor readings
during this investigation. 
(the away team enter the turbolift) 
DATA: Captain, may I speak to you alone?
