says hour away able leave maintain fatalities enterprise come

[Corridor]

PICARD: Number of casualties? 
CRUSHER: Sixty-six. 
PICARD: Fatalities? 
CRUSHER: None. We've been able to treat everyone.

[Troi's quarters]

PICARD: Can you help her? 
CRUSHER: I've done everything I can. I don't understand the nature of
this music she says she's hearing, or where it's coming from. 
PICARD: Could it be telepathic? 
CRUSHER: Yes. But I'm not the expert at determining that. 
PICARD: They're blocking her sensitivity. They're stopping her from
seeing the truth. 
CRUSHER: Who's stopping her? 
PICARD: Kevin and Rishon. 
CRUSHER: What? 
PICARD: They wanted us to leave Rana and that's exactly what we're
doing. Picard to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Number One, I want you to maintain this course for another hour

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: And then turn the Enterprise around
and take it back to Rana Four. 
RIKER: We still won't have our shields restored by then. 
[Troi's quarters]

PICARD: Take it back, Number One, and this time
nothing is going to lure us away.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, sensors indicate no spacecraft in the
vicinity of Rana Four. But, Captain 
PICARD: Forget your previous error, Mister Worf. There is no way you
could have prevented it. 
DATA: Captain, the Uxbridge house is coming into transporter range. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you accompany me to the Transporter Room? You
have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Captain, I think you should reconsider. The warship has come
after us twice. It could come back. 
PICARD: I disagree, Number One. I don't think it knows we're here. I
think it believes that it has run us off for good. However, that will
all change once I'm back on board. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: It's protecting Kevin and Rishon. It responds to their wishes.
Indirectly or directly, I'm not sure, but
that's what I'm going to put to the test.
