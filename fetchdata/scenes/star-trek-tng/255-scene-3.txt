(Geordi is the contraption used in Offspring and
Best of Both Worlds, wearing a virtual reality suit) 
CRUSHER: All his vital functions are completely normal. 
DATA: The interface unit is operating within expected parameters. 
RIKER: Why did he start coughing when he went through the gasses? 
CRUSHER: Psychosomatic response. 
LAFORGE: (no visor, white eyes) I feel like I'm actually here. I mean
there, in the Jefferies tube. It's funny. When I saw the smoke, I
couldn't help but cough. 
DATA: No one else has reported so complete a sensory experience. 
CRUSHER: The interface is perfect for Geordi because his visor inputs
allow the probe to transmit information directly into his cerebral
cortex. 
RIKER: It looks like this is going to work. Geordi, I'd like to get the
probe out of the Jefferies tube and onto the launch bay before we reach
Marijne Seven. 
LAFORGE: Will do. Wait a minute. 
[Jefferies tube]

LAFORGE: Something's wrong. Can't get my left leg
to work.

[Laboratory]

RIKER: What is it? 
CRUSHER: The probe is designed to respond to any movement Geordi
intends to make. When his brain sends a message to move his leg, the
interface should move the probe instead. 
DATA: Apparently the tactile sensors are too low. I will increase the
input.
