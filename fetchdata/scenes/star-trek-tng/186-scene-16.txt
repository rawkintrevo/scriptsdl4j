[Transporter room]

RIKER: Welcome aboard, sir. I'm Commander Riker,
First Officer. 
MAXWELL: I know all about you, Commander. Fine work you did with the
Borg. We all owe you on that one. 
RIKER: Thank you, sir. 
MAXWELL: O'Brien? Miles O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN: Hello, Captain. Good to see you again. 
MAXWELL: How are you? I had no idea you were on the Enterprise. This
was my Tactical Officer on the Rutledge. Best I ever had. 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. 
MAXWELL: O'Brien has the ability to size up a situation instantly, then
come up with options to fit all contingencies. Remarkable. 
O'BRIEN: Well, if that's true, I learned it from you, sir. 
MAXWELL: But you got that silver tongue by kissing the stone, right?
Well, Commander, best I see your Captain straight away. We've got a lot
to talk about. 
RIKER: Yes, sir.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Captain Benjamin
Maxwell. 
PICARD: That'll be all, Commander. 
(Riker leaves) 
PICARD: Captain. 
MAXWELL: A pleasure, Captain. 
PICARD: Please, sit down. 
MAXWELL: You must think I've gone mad. 
PICARD: The thought had occurred. 
MAXWELL: Picard, I have to tell you I was grateful when I realised it
was you Starfleet sent after me. Somebody who knows what it's really
like out here. 
PICARD: I know of nothing out here that could possibly justify what you
have done. 
MAXWELL: Then listen to this. The Cardassians are arming again. That
so-called science station? Military supply port. 
PICARD: How do you know this? 
MAXWELL: Information comes my way. 
PICARD: From whom? Where is your documentation? 
MAXWELL: I know what they're doing. I can smell it. There's no good
reason for a science station in the Cuellar System, but it's a hell of
a strategic site for a military transport station. A jumping-off point
into three Federation sectors. They're
running supply ships back and forth and nobody's going to tell me it's
for scientific research. 
PICARD: But whatever circumstances you encountered, why didn't you
notify Starfleet? 
MAXWELL: And wait six months while the bureaucrats sit around reading
reports, trying to figure out what to do? They don't know what's going
on out here. But you should, Picard. You know what it's like to be
under fire. 
PICARD: You weren't under fire. 
MAXWELL: Lives were at stake. 
PICARD: Whose lives? 
MAXWELL: We had to act now. 
PICARD: Why? 
MAXWELL: It smells musty in here. Like a bureaucrat's office. 
PICARD: You have killed nearly seven hundred people and you have taken
us to the brink of war. 
MAXWELL: I have prevented war, or at the very least delayed it a good
long time. The peace treaty was a ruse, to give them breathing room,
time to regroup. 
PICARD: And so all alone you decided to dispose of the treaty. 
MAXWELL: I took the initiative. I did what had to be done. 
PICARD: What had to be done? For whom? Why does a man with a long and
brilliant service abandon the fundamental principles that he has
believed in, even fought for, all his life? I believe it is because of
what they did to your wife and your children. 
MAXWELL: Not true. Not true. 
PICARD: To avenge their deaths. 
MAXWELL: You're a fool, Picard. History will look at you and say this
man was a fool. 
PICARD: I'll accept the judgement of history. 
MAXWELL: When it becomes clear what the Cardassians have done, I will
be vindicated. 
PICARD: What the Cardassians have or have not done is irrelevant. 
MAXWELL: Irrelevant? Come with me. Find one of their supply ships and
we'll see how irrelevant it is. 
PICARD: We're not going after any more Cardassian ships. You're going
to return to your bridge and set a course for Starbase two one one. The
Phoenix and the Enterprise will return to Federation space together.
Those are Starfleet's orders. I will permit you
the dignity of retaining your command during the voyage. The only
alternative is to put you in the brig and to tow your ship back to
starbase in disgrace. 
MAXWELL: I will return to my ship. 
PICARD: You understand your orders? 
MAXWELL: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, report to my Ready room. My guest is departing. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.

Captain's log, supplemental. With the Phoenix in
close formation, we are proceeding directly to Starbase two one one.
