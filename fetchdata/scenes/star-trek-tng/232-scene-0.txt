PICARD RIKER CRUSHER AMANDA

[Ready room]

 PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise, Miss Rogers.
I'm delighted to have you aboard. 
AMANDA: (a beautiful young blonde woman) Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: And congratulations. I understand that you were selected for
this internship out of hundreds of applicants. 
AMANDA: Yes, sir. I still can't believe they chose me. There were lots
of other people with better records. 
CRUSHER: Your transcript is very impressive. She's done honours work in
neurobiology, plasma dynamics, and eco-regeneration. I'd say that's
pretty well rounded. 
AMANDA: That's a nice way of saying that I haven't decided what I'm
going to do with my life. 
CRUSHER: I've arranged to have you work in all the major departments
while you're here, and I'm willing to bet that by the time it's over
you'll have a pretty good idea what field you're interested in. 
PICARD: Or at least what fields you're not interested in. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: We're bringing up the rest of the cargo now. We should be ready
to leave within the hour. 
PICARD: Commander, will you escort Miss Rogers to her quarters? I need
to discuss the Tagran's medical needs with Doctor Crusher. And Miss
Rogers? 
AMANDA: Yes? 
PICARD: You've won yourself a rare opportunity. Avail yourself of it. 
AMANDA: I will, sir. And thank you.
