RIKER LAFORGE WORF JAMESON PICARD TROI KARNAS TASHA CRUSHER DATA

[Transporter room]

(Worf, Tasha, Data and Geordi are already on the
pads) 
JAMESON: Prepare to energise, Chief. 
PICARD: Belay that. Admiral, your proper place is on the Bridge. 
JAMESON: I will remind you one more time, Picard, I am the Senior
Mission Commander and I'm leading this team. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: The Admiral is correct, Number One. He has that right. But I am
the Captain of this ship, and I have a right to accompany him. Riker,
you're in command of the Enterprise. Energise.

[Tunnel]

(It is spacious, good high ceiling with light
streaming through, curved concrete walls) 
JAMESON: Yes, perfect. We are in the M4 tunnel, directly under the
Governor's residence. M-4 is a subsidiary tunnel, but it crosses and
links with several main ones. 
DATA: I am sorry, sir. That does not correspond with the information in
my tricorder, sir.
JAMESON: Your information is incorrect, Commander. I know these tunnels
like the back of my own hand. Keep scanning for signs of human life
forms. Karnas held his hostages in these tunnels before. He'll do it
again. 
(The group head down a tunnel) 
DATA: Captain, the Admiral is definitely incorrect. The tunnel
schematics we have show this to be a dead end. It was sealed off two
years ago. 
PICARD: No doubt you're right, Mister Data. However, forty five years
ago, I'm sure it linked in with the tunnels the Admiral remembers. 
(They arrive at the dead end) 
JAMESON: Damn. 
PICARD: Geordi? 
LAFORGE: This is steelplast, sir. Fairly recent installation. 
JAMESON: This is the most direct route. Set phasers to cut through it. 
(Worf and Tasha cut an opening in the wall) 
TASHA: If you have the coordinates where you think the hostages are,
sir, we could just beam in over there. 
JAMESON: Karnas may not have them in the same place. There's no
substitute, Lieutenant, for personal reconnoitre. 
(He leads them through the hole) 
LAFORGE: Admiral, there's an infrared light signal ahead. Steady beam,
straight across the tunnel, chest high. There's another at waist level.

TASHA: An alarm trigger or 
PICARD: Reset phasers to stun. 
(A phaser beam just misses them) 
PICARD: Take cover! 
(Armed soldiers appear. Every one ducks behind convenient barrels and
suchlike. Tasha gets in front of Picard. Jameson stands exposed) 
WORF: Sir, look out! 
(Worf knocks Jameson out of the way of another blast) 
DATA: Their phasers, sir, set on kill. 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. I have heard the sound before. 
(Tasha takes out two soldiers, then Jameson cries in pain) 
TASHA: Is he hit? 
DATA: No sign of a wound. 
PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Six to beam up, now!

[Bridge]

RIKER: The Admiral? 
PICARD: Sickbay. Not good is a galactic understatement. 
LAFORGE: Sir? Karnas again, sir. On screen. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: Enterprise. There has been an armed intrusion
in the tunnels beneath the city. That smells of Jameson. Where is he? 
PICARD: Karnas, this is Picard. I'm sorry to inform you the Admiral is
critically ill. 
KARNAS [on viewscreen]: That is not my concern. Sick or well, you have
ten minutes to beam him down. 
TROI [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge. 
PICARD: Picard. 
TROI [OC]: Doctor Crusher 
[Sickbay]

TROI: Requests your presence in Sickbay
immediately, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I'm on my way.

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Sickbay.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: What is it, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I think you'd better see for yourself, Captain. 
(Jameson is on a bed, very ill) 
JAMESON: Picard. Picard, I have to get to Karnas. 
CRUSHER: I can't allow him out of my care, Captain. 
JAMESON: It's my last option, Picard. The raid failed. All I have left
to bargain with is myself. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Picard. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
RIKER [OC]: A new message from Karnas, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes,
one of the hostages will be executed. 
[Sickbay]

RIKER [OC]: Fifteen minutes after that, another.
