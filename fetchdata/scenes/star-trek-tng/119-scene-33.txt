PICARD [OC]: And when I tell you, pull up hard.
JAKE: Point zero two zero speed. Captain, I sure hope you're right. 
PICARD [OC]: You'll just have to trust me. 
JAKE: Point zero zero three. 
[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero zero nine. Zero one two. 
DATA: Six seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Hold on, Jake. It's going to be a little bumpy. 
[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Zero one five. 
[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero one nine. 
PICARD: Restart the engine, now! Pull up hard! 
REMMICK: (amongst others) Yeah! 
RIKER: Incredible, Captain! 
REMMICK: How did he do it? I thought 
LAFORGE: He built up enough speed and then bounced her off the
atmosphere! 
PICARD: Mister Kurland, I assume you can manoeuvre it home? 
JAKE [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Do it. Then report to Mister Riker. 
JAKE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir! 
REMMICK: Very original, Captain. But how did that child acquire access
to a shuttlecraft? 
RIKER: Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate,
fully trained in many areas including shuttles. 
REMMICK: And did this full training include discipline? 
PICARD: Mister Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Which is
why Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically in
discipline 
REMMICK: I'll note that in my report. 
PICARD: Full cooperation, Number One.

[Relva 7 Corridor]

RONDON: You. I have a package for Operations. Where
is it? 
WESLEY: End of the corridor, room on your right. One oh four. 
(The seven foot tall man bumps Wesley as he walks between him and
Mordock) 
WESLEY: Excuse me. 
RONDON: You blocked my path. you Bulgallian sludge rat! 
WESLEY: I'm sorry, it was an honest mistake. I apologise. 
CHANG: Is there a problem here, gentlemen? 
WESLEY: No, sir, I 
RONDON: How dare you! I am Rondon, you despicable Melanoid slimeworm!
Liar! 
WESLEY: Who do you think you're bullying? You bumped into me. It was
your mistake. You were at fault. Do you want this to become violent? 
RONDON: Friend. I like you. 
(Rondon leaves, smiling) 
MORDOCK: A very strange reaction. 
WESLEY: Not really. When he raised his hand, I saw that it was webbed.
The sign of a Zaldan. 
CHANG: But you became hostile. 
WESLEY: Zaldans are infuriated by courtesy. They view it as a form of
phony social behaviour, designed to cover true feelings. 
CHANG: Congratulations, Mister Crusher. You handled that particular
incident very well. 
MORDOCK: Was this incident deliberate? 
CHANG: It's important to know how you candidates deal with other
cultures, other species. 
MORDOCK: Then it was a test. 
CHANG: Yes. Not all tests are announced, or what they appear to be. 
(Chang leaves) 
MORDOCK: Zaldans have webbed fingers? I wouldn't have passed.

[Observation Lounge]

REMMICK: You're an android, correct? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
REMMICK: And as an android, you are programmed to tell the entire
truth? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
REMMICK: There is a problem with this ship, Mister Data. It's in the
records, somewhere. I need your help to find it. 
DATA: All of the ship's records are available to you, sir. 
REMMICK: This information is very cleverly hidden. Your Captain is not
what he appears to be. Do not forget you have loyalty to Starfleet
above all else. 
DATA: Loyalty is not the issue, Commander. There is nothing wrong with
Captain Picard or the ship's logs. Therefore there must be something
wrong with your original assumption. 
REMMICK: That is not acceptable, Mister Data. 
DATA: Acceptable or not, sir, it is the truth. 
REMMICK: Just how did this contaminant get aboard the ship? 
WORF: By accident, sir. 
REMMICK: Meaning Captain Picard has no standing procedure for this type
of situation? 
WORF: No. Meaning by accident, sir. 
REMMICK: You don't like me very much, do you? 
WORF: Is it required, sir? 
REMMICK: How would you characterise your relationship with Captain
Picard? 
CRUSHER: We're Starfleet officers who've known each other for many
years. 
REMMICK: Everything said here is confidential, Doctor. You can be
completely open with me. 
CRUSHER: About what? 
REMMICK: About how you feel serving with a man who is responsible for
the death of your husband. 
CRUSHER: My personal feelings about Captain Picard are irrelevant to
this investigation, and none of your business. 
REMMICK: Then you confirm the accuracy of the log report. You violated
the Prime Directive with the Edo. You deliberately interfered with
their laws. 
PICARD: Yes. It's exactly as I explained it in the log records. 
REMMICK: All to save Doctor Crusher's son? 
PICARD: A member of my crew was being held unjustly. I stand by my
decision. Mister Remmick, you have talked to every member of this ship.
I think you've had enough time to find out whatever it is you're
looking for. 
REMMICK: Are you afraid if I keep looking that I'll find you're guilty?

PICARD: The only thing I'm guilty of is allowing this charade to go on
so long.

[Admiral's Quarters]

PICARD: Admiral, if it is me you're investigating,
ask me directly what it is you want to know. And please tell me exactly
what is going on. 
QUINN: I need a little more time, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: How much time? I won't tolerate my crew being harassed any
longer. 
QUINN: Remmick's full report is almost ready. 
PICARD: I want to be here when he presents it. 
QUINN: That has always been my intention. Commander Remmick, report to
Admiral Quinn. 
REMMICK [OC]: On my way, sir. 
PICARD: This has been a strain on our friendship. 
QUINN: I know. Believe me, Jean Luc, I regret that, but it has been
necessary.

[Classroom]

(The dynamics relationships test is on the screens,
and there are a lot of beeps going on) 
MORDOCK: I can't get it. 
WESLEY: Yes, you can. Don't fight it. Relax into it and let it come by
itself. 
MORDOCK: No, it's going too fast. Wesley, I can't do it. 
(Wesley turns from his own screen to look at Mordock's) 
WESLEY: Yes you can. You've got your rotation factor. Just put in your
vector coordinates. 
(Mordock finishes first, Wesley second. The Vulcan finished too.) 
COMPUTER: Time elapsed. 
(Chang enters.) 
CHANG: Congratulations, Mordock. That was the second fastest time ever
recorded on this test. You all did well. 
MORDOCK: No, it should not have been that way. Mister Crusher helped
me. 
CHANG: Yes. I know. An interesting choice, Mister Crusher. Especially
considering how close you and Mister Mordock are in overall score. You
all have an hour to prepare for your last test. 
WESLEY: The psych test, sir? 
CHANG: We prefer to think of it as a psychological evaluation based on
reactions to various individual problems, but psych test will do.
