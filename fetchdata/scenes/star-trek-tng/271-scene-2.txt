BARCLAY: Me? 
DATA: It is possible that it will take several days for Captain Picard

BARCLAY: Well, I'd be honoured.

BARCLAY: Really? That's hard to believe. You're such a sweet little
kitty. 
DATA: She is to you. However, there have been several injuries to other
members of the crew who have attempted to care for her. 
BARCLAY: So, has she picked a place? 
DATA: A place?

BARCLAY: I'm curious, sir. Who's the father? 
DATA: I am not certain. Spot has escaped from my quarters on several
occasions and there are twelve male felines on board. I intend to run a

BARCLAY: You have nothing to worry about, sir.
