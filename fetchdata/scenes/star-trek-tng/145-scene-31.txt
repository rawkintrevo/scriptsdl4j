[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Bridge, this is Doctor Pulaski. 
[Bridge]

PULASKI [OC]: We've just completed the transfer.
The Antedeans are now in Sickbay. 
RIKER: Acknowledged, Doctor. 
(Lwaxana and Homn enter) 
TROI: Mother, what are you doing here? You can't just stroll on to the
Bridge whenever you feel like it. 
LWAXANA: I didn't just stroll on, dear. I took the turbo tube, or
whatever you call it. The Captain's not here? 
RIKER: He is busy elsewhere, ma'am. 
LWAXANA: I have other interests as well. 
TROI [telepath]: You're scheming something, Mother. Don't try to fool
me, I can tell. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: You're always so melodramatic, Little One. I'm not
scheming, I'm deciding. 
TROI [telepath]: Mother, not him. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: And why not him? He's adorable. 
[Sickbay]

(A round fish-eye flicks open) 
PULASKI: Pulaski to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PULASKI: The Antedeans are coming around. They are currently in the
early stages of post hibernation.

[Bridge]

RIKER: How long until they're fully conscious? 
PULASKI [OC]: I'd guess it to be a matter of hours now. 
RIKER: Very well, I'll inform the Captain. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. 
LWAXANA: You're going to see the Captain? But I thought he was tied up
on ship's business. 
RIKER: In a manner of speaking he is. I'm not going to be disturbing
him, I'll just give him the message. 
LWAXANA: Excellent timing. Then you may also inform him about us. 
RIKER: Us? 
LWAXANA: You don't mind if I let our ship's crew know first, do you,
William? Friends. Dear friends. You are all invited to a prestigious
occasion on the planet Pacifica. 
TROI: No. 
LWAXANA: There, on the shores of the Western Sea, in a traditional
Betazoid ceremony, your Commander Riker and I will be joined in the
union of matrimony. 
WESLEY: Married? 
LWAXANA: Until death us do part. 
RIKER: Mrs. Troi, I don't know how to tell you this. 
LWAXANA: I know how you feel, dear. You're overwhelmed with excitement.
Believe me, I understand. We'll talk about the details later. Right
now, there are preparations to be made. 
(Lwaxana and Homn leave) 
TROI: Why did you stop me? Someone needs to set her straight! 
RIKER: I think I'll leave that to the Captain. 
TROI: Coward. 
DATA: Commander. Are you planning on going into the holodeck? 
RIKER: I thought I might. Would you like to join me? 
DATA: Could you postpone our departure for just five minutes, sir? 
RIKER: No problem.
