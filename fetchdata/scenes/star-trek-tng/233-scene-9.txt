[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We think the shuttle was caught in a
molecular reversion field, which caused the structure of the ship to
deteriorate. When the field penetrated the hull, it also began to
affect the shuttle's crew. 
O'BRIEN: When I tried to beam them off, I wasn't able to get a lock
because the reversion field was masking part of the patterns. 
CRUSHER: If the transporter only registered part of the RVN patterns,
that would explain why the key sequences are missing. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. With those key sequences missing, the transporter
reconstructed them as children. 
RIKER: If they're right, would you be able to use the transporter to
reverse the effects? 
CRUSHER: I think so. As long as there's no reversion field to mask
their patterns, we should be able to do it. Chief, can you adjust the
molecular imaging scanners to accept 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: We are entering orbit around Ligos Seven, sir. 
RIKER: On my way. We'll discuss this later.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Standard orbit, Ensign. Any sign of the
science team? 
DATA: We've been scanning the area since entering the system, but our
readings are being disrupted. 
RIKER: Cause? 
DATA: Extreme fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. However, there
is no evidence of stellar or seismic activity which would cause the
interference. 
RIKER: Any response to our hails, Mister Worf? 
WORF: No, sir. I have been attempting to. Commander, two ships
decloaking fore and aft. Klingon birds of prey, B'rel class. 
(which promptly start firing at the Enterprise) 
RIKER: Maximum shields. Take us out of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf,
prepare to return fire. 
(Young Picard rushes out of his quarters at the Red alert) 
RIKER: Damage report. 
WORF: We've lost primary life support. Switching to secondary systems. 
RIKER: Lock phasers on target bearing to port. 
WORF: Phasers locked. 
RIKER: Fire. 
DATA: Minor damage to one ship. Its shields are holding. 
WORF: Starboard power coupling is down. Warp engines are offline. 
RIKER: Shields? 
WORF: Down to thirteen percent. 
(the ship takes more hits) 
WORF: Casualties reported on decks twenty six and twenty seven. 
DATA: Sensors and secondary generators are offline. Life support down
to sixty seven percent. 
RIKER: Engineering, status report.
