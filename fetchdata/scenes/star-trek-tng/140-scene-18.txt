[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Riker enters) 
PICARD: Number One? 
RIKER: I'd be a fool to turn that promotion down, wouldn't I? 
PICARD: I don't know, and if you're asking me what I think you should
do, I don't know that either. I can spell out for you, albeit crudely,
what you are choosing between. As the First Officer of the Enterprise
you have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort.
You are the second in command of Starfleet's flagship, but still second
in command. Your promotion will transfer you to a relatively
insignificant ship in an obscure corner of the galaxy But it
will be your ship, and being who you are, it will soon be vibrant with
your authority, your style, your vision. You know, there really is no
substitute for holding the reins. 
RIKER: I'll need a little more time to make this decision.

[Engineering]

O'BRIEN: Find anything yet? 
LAFORGE: Not yet. 
DATA: There is nothing to find. 
O'BRIEN: No harm in checking, I guess. 
LAFORGE: Really? How would you like them to give the transporter
operation a little once-over? 
O'BRIEN: No problem. We're totally ship-shape. 
LAFORGE: You're missing the point. It's just the idea that they even
suspect a malfunction. 
DATA: If I were not a consummate professional, and an android, I would
find this entire procedure insulting. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data. 
(Another part of Engineering, where Wesley is talking to Guy) 
WESLEY: Chief, will you be able to attend a little party for Lieutenant
Worf at seventeen hundred hours? 
O'BRIEN: A party for Worf? Sounds intriguing. I'd be delighted. 
WESLEY: It's a surprise. 
O'BRIEN: My lips are sealed.
