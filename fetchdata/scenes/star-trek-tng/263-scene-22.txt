WORF: Setting course for the fissure. 
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: Captain, the shuttlecraft is under attack. 
RIKER: The Bajorans again. 
WESLEY: No, sir. It's one of the Enterprises. They're hailing us. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(a bad signal and a Riker with a full ragged beard) 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: We won't go back. You don't know what it's like
in our universe. The Federation's gone, the Borg is everywhere! We're
one of the last ships left. Please, you've got to help us! 
RIKER: I'm sorry, there's no choice. If this works, everything will
return to 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: No, we won't go back! 
(transmission ends) 
WESLEY: Sir, they're firing on the shuttlecraft. 
RIKER: Open fire. Try to disable them. 
WESLEY: Direct hit. Their shields have collapsed. Their engine core is
overloading. 
(KaBOOM) 
RIKER: What happened? 
WESLEY: It looks like the ship had already taken heavy damage. Their
warp containment field must have been weak. 
RIKER: Probably from fighting with the Borg. 
DATA: Captain, Worf is entering the fissure.

[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Charging primary systems. Initiating inverse
warp field. 
(there's a flash, there are at least three Worfs in gold and four in
red, then Worf in gold is lying on the floor. He gets up) 
WORF: Worf to Enterprise. 
PICARD [OC]: Enterprise here. 
WORF: Captain, is everything all right? 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a problem? 
WORF: No, I do not believe so, but I will explain when I arrive. 
PICARD [OC]: How was the Bat'leth tournament? 
(he checks the trophy) 
WORF: It was fine, sir. I won Champion Standing.
