PICARD CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Ready room]

(Picard is discovering familiar passages in his
book) 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Can you come to Sickbay immediately? It's urgent. 
PICARD: I'm on my way.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: His dizziness is being caused by a phase
shift in his visual receptors. It's causing him to see things that
aren't there. 
LAFORGE: They're like blurry after-images. 
CRUSHER: I ran a scan to see if I could detect what he was seeing. I
picked up miniscule distortions in the surrounding dekyon field. His
visor seems to be translating those distortions into visual impulses. 
LAFORGE: Could be a malfunction in the ship's warp field generator.
I'll check it out. 
PICARD: While you're at it, run a localised subspace scan to look for
anything unusual. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Keep me advised, Doctor.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lateral sensors online. Subspace scanners
active. Data, would you run a level two diagnostic on the warp
subsystems? 
DATA: Certainly. 
(the display keeps flashing up the number 3) 
LAFORGE: All threes. that can't be right. 
DATA: I have encountered the numeral three an inordinate number of
times over the last two hours. 
LAFORGE: We have got a dekyon field fluctuation on deck nine, section
twenty eight. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I just heard what sounded like voices in my room, but
there's no one here. 
LAFORGE: Sensors just picked up something strange, too. We're checking
it out. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I'm on my way down. 
(the sound of breaking glass) 
LAFORGE: Doctor Crusher, are you all right? 
CRUSHER [OC]: I'm fine.
