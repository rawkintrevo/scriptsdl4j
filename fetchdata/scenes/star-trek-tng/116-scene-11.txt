RIKER ONEONE MINUET COMPUTER ZEROZERO CRUSHER

[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Well, since then I've been working on an
approach that combines cybernetics and regeneration. It sounds
impossible, I know, but I have found an approach which will work. I
mean, what an opportunity. To have a chance to talk with Doctor
Epstein. Sorry, Will, I'd love to chat, but I have to go.

[Outside holodeck]

(Bynars with a different style of clothes are
working) 
RIKER: How's it going? 
ZERO ZERO: (left hand side) We are almost done. 
ONE ONE: (right hand side) The deviation 
ZERO ZERO: caused by a previous 
ONE ONE: probe has been corrected 
ZERO ZERO: You may use the equipment 
ONE ONE: anytime you wish. 
RIKER: How much has been changed? What exactly did you do? 
ONE ONE: Enhancement. 
ZERO ZERO: Nothing more. 
(They talk to each other in binary) 
ZERO ZERO: Would you like to try 
ONE ONE: the enhancement? 
RIKER: All right. What should I choose? Computer, I'd like some place
to play some music. A little atmosphere. 
COMPUTER: Specify. 
RIKER: Jazz. 
COMPUTER: Era? 
RIKER: Circa 1958. 
COMPUTER: Location. 
RIKER: Kansas City. No, wait. New Orleans. Bourbon Street Bar, New
Orleans. Around two a.m. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. Enter when ready.

[Holodeck]

(A nightclub with a slightly raised stage, tables
with candles for light) 
RIKER: Very good. Very good indeed. Now I'll need someone to play with.
A trio. Piano, bass and drums, and a 'bone for me. 
(The musicians appear) 
RIKER: Now an audience. Whoa. Too many. I was thinking of something a
little more intimate. 
(A single blonde in a red dress) 
RIKER: Great job, boys. But, computer, blondes and jazz seldom go
together. (a red-head) Now that is truly exceptional. But more sultry. 
(A brunette at the bar) 
RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call enhancement, you've got a
gift for understatement. 
(The Bynars work on the internal controls as the band starts playing) 
RIKER: What's your name? Tell me you love jazz. 
MINUET: My name is Minuet and I love all jazz except Dixieland. 
RIKER: Why not Dixieland? 
MINUET: You can't dance to it. 
RIKER: My girl. What's a knockout like you doing in a
computer-generated gin joint like this? 
MINUET: Waiting for you. 
RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious. 
MINUET: Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. 
(The Bynars leave)
