[Starbase Command Centre]

(Data and Geordi beam in) 
WORF: Did you see the Captain and Commander Riker? 
DATA: No. Are they not here on Starbase? 
TASHA: No, we thought 
LAFORGE: You mean they're still on the Enterprise? 
WORF: Yes. Sir, where is your transporter room? 
DATA: We have to beam back and get them. 
GUEST0: You haven't time. 
GUEST2: This is Starbase 74. The Enterprise magnetic field is
regenerating. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute. How is that possible? 
GUEST2: Unknown. 
TASHA: That changes nothing. The Captain and Commander Riker must be in
trouble, or they'd be here. 
GUEST0: Look. Your ship is almost clear. 
(Enterprise gracefully backs out of the space doors and warps away)

[Holodeck]

(The only red here is Minuet's dress. Riker and
Minuet are staring into each other's eyes) 
GUEST6: And the boy never found out? 
RIKER: Oh, yes, but not until later when he came back into the room
with his little sister. 
GUEST6: I'll bet both of them were all smiles. 
RIKER: Yes, but by that time both of them had been found out. 
GUEST6: You handled that in a very thoughtful way. You're very good
with people. Don't you agree, Jean-Luc? 
PICARD: She's so very different from the images we've experienced on
the holodeck, isn't she? She's more intuitive. 
RIKER: It's as though she's been plugged into my subconscious. She
already knows what I want her to say before I'm aware of it myself. 
PICARD: I suppose it's an understandable progression. Computers make
decisions based on inputs and we humans give off a multitude of subtle
signs that communicate our emotions. 
RIKER: It's uncanny. I could develop feelings for Minuet, exactly as I
would for any woman. 
PICARD: Doesn't love always begin that way? With the illusion being
more real than the woman? 
GUEST6: Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken like a true Frenchman. 
PICARD: Well, I think I'll be leaving. 
GUEST6: Oh, don't go. 
PICARD: Two's company. 
GUEST6: We have time. There's no rush. I'd really like it if you would
stay. 
RIKER: Yes, Captain, stay. 
PICARD: This is your diversion, Number One, not mine. 
GUEST6: Wait! We haven't danced. 
PICARD: I don't dance. 
GUEST6: Then some more wine. 
PICARD: No, thank you. 
GUEST6: Wait! Please! Please, don't go. You can't. Not yet. 
RIKER: Why? What's the matter? Why can't he leave? 
PICARD: Exit! 
(The holodeck doors open and they seen and hear the Red Alert. Picard
goes to the arch controls) 
PICARD: Captain to Bridge. Situation report. 
RIKER: Riker to Bridge. 
PICARD: Computer, explain Red Alert. 
COMPUTER: Initiated as a programmed response. The magnetic field
containing the antimatter had weakened. There was no fail-safe
available. 
PICARD: Why wasn't I notified? 
COMPUTER: Unknown. 
PICARD: Present condition? 
COMPUTER: The magnetic field is now restored. Containment is restored.
Propulsion is at maximum efficiency. 
PICARD: Locate Lieutenant Commander Data. 
COMPUTER: Not on board the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Explain. 
COMPUTER: All Enterprise personnel except the Captain and First Officer
have been evacuated. 
PICARD: Evacuated? Was the condition that critical? 
COMPUTER: Yes. 
RIKER: Are we still docked at the starbase? 
COMPUTER: No. 
PICARD: Position report. 
COMPUTER: Co-ordinates four one five nine point two six by eight one
nine two one by three one two. Heading two three three mark four five. 
PICARD: Destination? 
COMPUTER: Planet Bynaus in the Beta Magellan system. 
RIKER: The Bynars. 
PICARD: Am I to understand the Bynars have stolen the Enterprise? 
COMPUTER: That information is not available. 
PICARD: It's the Bynars, and you're part of this. 
GUEST6: Yes. 
RIKER: They made you the lure to keep me here. They programmed you
while I was relaxing. 
GUEST6: Yes. When they saw your interest in me, they thought I could
distract you and keep you here. 
PICARD: That explains, Riker. What about me? 
GUEST6: Your being here was just a fortunate happenstance. 
RIKER: Why do they want with me? 
PICARD: What do they want with the Enterprise? What's their purpose? 
GUEST6: I'm not programmed to give you that information. 
PICARD: Come on, Number One. We've got to regain control of our ship.
