SURGEON: It's not working. Something's wrong. The
metabolation occlusions aren't holding. Damn it! I can't stop the
heterocyclic declination. Fuse. 
(laser beams fire down) 
SURGEON: Again! We need a biomolecular physiologist in here. This man
is dying. 
MEDIC: Right away, sir.

LAFORGE: You've got to be kidding. 
GREBNEDLOG: Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: Come on. There's not enough juice in these to blow up a
passing asteroid. 
GREBNEDLOG: Do it. Make us strong. 
LAFORGE: I suppose we could increase the anti-matter charges. 
REGINOD: Yes. We like power. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
GREBNEDLOG: Do not try to trick us. We can tell.

(The specialist has been dragged in from the golf
course) 
PHYSIOLOGIST: Metabolation? 
SURGEON: Negative. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: Heterocyclics? 
SURGEON: Failing. And capillary integrity too unpredictable to attempt
a resect. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: You're unwilling to make the attempt?? 
SURGEON: I'm not qualified. 
PHYSIOLOGIST: I know someone who is.

[Engineering]

SONYA: Are you sure he can do it, sir? Geordi's an
engineer, not a weapons specialist. 
RIKER: If anyone can improvise, it's Geordi. 
SONYA: What makes you think the Pakleds even have that kind of gear on
board? 
DATA: Ongoing scanning indicates progressive weapons potential. The
timing will be crucial. Geordi must correctly interpret our intentions.

RIKER: Geordi's up to speed. I trust his instincts. 
DATA: The Pakleds did hear our little fiction about Geordi's weapons
knowledge. 
RIKER: Exactly. And since they equate intelligence with strength, they
won't pass up the chance to use that knowledge. Can you do it? 
SONYA: Count on it. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Commander Riker! 
RIKER: Go ahead, Bridge.
