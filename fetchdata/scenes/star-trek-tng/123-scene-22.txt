[Observation Lounge]

T'JON: We have to resolve this soon. There isn't
much time. 
SOBI: What can you offer? 
T'JON: Everything we had went down with the Sanction. 
SOBI: Then it's going to be difficult to accommodate you.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Solar flares are increasing in magnitude,
Captain. Shields are shaky, but they're holding. 
PICARD: Maintain. 
(Riker and Tasha enter) 
PICARD: How are our rather quarrelsome guests? 
TASHA: They're waiting for you in the observation lounge, sir. 
PICARD: Data, what information can you give us about the inhabitants of
this system? 
DATA: Not very much, sir. The only recorded contact with the Delos
system was over two hundred years ago. A scout ship reported two
inhabited planets, one of which was on the verge of acquiring space
travel. 
LAFORGE: Odd that in two centuries neither civilisation advanced much
further. 
TROI: Sir, I find it strange that none of our visitors feels much
remorse about the two freighter passengers who perished. Yet that
barrel of cargo is a source of great anxiety to them. 
PICARD: Yes. Let's pay a call, get some answers. Number One, Mister
Data. Mister La Forge, you have the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
[Observation Lounge]

RIKER: Captain, may I present Sobi and Langor from
the planet Brekka, and T'Jon and Romas from Ornara. 
PICARD: I am sorry we couldn't save your ship. 
T'JON: Tell me, you could have repaired it. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. 
T'JON: We have only two left. Neither works properly. They are critical
to our survival. Will you fix them? 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Our computer has downloaded the specifications for the magnetic
coils the freighters depend on. Assuming the malfunction is similar,
suitable replacements can be fabricated. 
PICARD: Instruct Engineering to proceed. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
T'JON: Now, as for our cargo. 
SOBI: Our cargo, Captain. 
ROMAS: Wrong, Sobi. 
PICARD: My First Officer has said that ownership of this cargo is in
dispute, but this question must be settled by whatever legal mechanism
exists between your societies. 
T'JON: Captain, you don't understand. This is a matter of life and
death. 
PICARD: Why is that? What is this cargo? 
T'JON: Medicine. 
PICARD: Indeed? 
ROMAS: Our planet is in desperate need, Captain. We have people
suffering from a lethal plague. 
T'JON: The cargo you have impounded is the only hope of life for our
people. 
PICARD: Is that so? 
SOBI: Yes. 
LANGOR: You must think us heartless brutes, Captain, but look at our
side of it. The plant which yields the medicine felicium grows only in
remote areas of Brekka. 
SOBI: It must be painstakingly cultivated, harvested, purified. A
complex and expensive process. 
LANGOR: That single shipment of felicium represents an enormous
investment. We can't just give it away. 
T'JON: We paid for it. We are asking only for what is ours. 
LANGOR: That is your viewpoint. Ours, of course, differs. 
ROMAS: You are going to hold to that position? 
SOBI: I am constrained to abide by the terms of our agreement. 
ROMAS: Then you condemn us to death! 
T'JON: Romas. 
ROMAS: You disgust me! If you could see the suffering the plague has
caused. Well, you are going to, when you see what it does to us. 
PICARD: Romas, are you and T'Jon carrying this plague? 
ROMAS: Yes. Every Ornaran does. 
PICARD: Then you may have brought it aboard this ship. Was there a
medical scan when they transported? 
RIKER: Unverified. The solar flares could have caused a malfunction in
the biofilter. 
PICARD: Med Alert. Medical emergency. Doctor Crusher to the observation
lounge at once.

[Sickbay]

(Romas is suffering on a bed) 
SOBI: You find us well, I trust? 
CRUSHER: As far as I can tell. Your physiology is somewhat different
than I've ever encountered, but I detect no dangerous virus or
bacteria. 
LANGOR: I assure you we're in perfect health. 
T'JON: But we are not. We need our medicine. 
SOBI: Our medicine. 
T'JON: We paid for it. It's ours now. 
CRUSHER: Enough! 
SOBI: Of course. You are right, Doctor. Could we leave now? 
CRUSHER: I see no reason why not. Escort them to their quarters. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Doctor. 
LANGOR: Captain, could I speak with you please? In private. 
CRUSHER: Not right now. Captain. 
[Doctor's office]

PICARD: What have you learned? 
CRUSHER: The Brekkians show no sign of infection. The Ornarans show all
the symptoms of a disease but I can't find a cause. 
PICARD: Perhaps it was filtered out by the transporter when they were
beamed aboard? 
CRUSHER: There's no record of it. Then again, the solar flare activity
might have caused a malfunction in the biofilters or their monitors. 
PICARD: Are they going to die? 
CRUSHER: I need to check further, but my instinct says no. 
PICARD: Do you think we are in danger from this plague? 
CRUSHER: Again, I need more time. 
PICARD: There are some missing pieces to this puzzle. 
CRUSHER: What's missing is a little compassion. 
PICARD: Are we losing our professional detachment, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Perhaps. But Captain, I must tell you, I'm developing a very
active dislike for these Brekkians. 
PICARD: Understandable.
