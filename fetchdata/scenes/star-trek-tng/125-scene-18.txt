RIKER SAVAR PICARD REMMICK AARON QUINN

[Starfleet Reception area]

SAVAR: Welcome home, Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Thank you, sir. My first officer will be joining us shortly. 
SAVAR: Yes, I'm sure he will. 
AARON: You've met Commander Remmick, haven't you? 
REMMICK: Under less than ideal circumstances. It's nice to see you
again, Captain. 
SAVAR: We've prepared a special meal in your honour. 
PICARD: Delightful. Tell me, why is the corridor so quiet? The last
time I was here, it was bustling with activity. 
REMMICK: It usually is. Tonight's a quiet night. 
SAVAR: Yes, a quiet night. 
[Guest quarters]

RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? 
QUINN: Quite ready, Commander. 
RIKER: What's in the case? 
QUINN: Actually, I brought it for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you would
like you to see it first? 
RIKER: What is it? 
QUINN: A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team
on an uncharted planet. 
RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? 
QUINN: Oh, you'll be hearing about it shortly, but first there remains
much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of
life. 
RIKER: Superior? 
QUINN: Totally. Come, have a look. 
RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. 
(Quinn grabs his arm with a surprising amount of strength) 
QUINN: It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins.
They do wonders for the body. 
(There's a very one-sided fight - Quinn easily throws Riker around the
room)
RIKER: Riker to Security. Guest quarters seventeen. Emergency. 
(Quinn knocks Riker out cold)

[Ante room]

AARON: Let's have some Andonian tea while we wait
for your Riker. Then you can tell us about what's brought you here. 
PICARD: I see you keep up with our duty roster. 
AARON: Yes, of course, Captain. The Enterprise is very important to us.

REMMICK: Excuse me, gentlemen. 
(Remmick leaves) 
AARON: To the Horatio, gentlemen. 
SAVAR: The Horatio. 
(Picard does not drink) 
AARON: What an awful tragedy. Such a terrible loss of life. 
PICARD: It's interesting that you should mention the Horatio. It's one
of the subjects I wanted to discuss. 
AARON: Really? 
PICARD: Has the cause of her destruction been ascertained? 
SAVAR: Absolutely. Implosion, due to extreme negligence on the part of
her Captain. 
AARON: Enjoy, Picard. I believe you'll find it an excellent aperitif.
