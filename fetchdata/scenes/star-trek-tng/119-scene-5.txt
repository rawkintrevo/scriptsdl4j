PICARD RIKER REMMICK DATA LAFORGE
runs frankly smoothly doing come notes shall cooperation frustrating

[Bridge]

(Remmick is tapping notes into his PADD) 
DATA: May I help you, Mister Remmick? 
REMMICK: Keep on doing whatever it is you're doing, Commander Data. 
LAFORGE: There's nothing much to see here, Commander. We're in a
standard orbit, and the station has to be manned even if it's just
routine. 
RIKER: Something I can help you with, Mister Remmick? 
REMMICK: When I'm ready, Mister Riker, I'll want to speak with you.
Privately. 
LAFORGE: Commander, just having that guy around makes me feel guilty.
What's he after, anyway? 
RIKER: I don't know, Geordi, but I'm going to find out. Right now.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: Captain, may I speak frankly? 
PICARD: Always, Number One. 
RIKER: As First Officer, I should be informed. I should know everything
that you know. 
PICARD: That's right, you should. 
RIKER: Then what's this about? Remmick is going to turn this ship
upside down. 
PICARD: That's his job. 
RIKER: And my job is to see that this ship runs smoothly. 
PICARD: Which you do very well. 
RIKER: Sir, am I under investigation? 
PICARD: I don't know. 
RIKER: And if you did? 
PICARD: I couldn't tell you. 
RIKER: I don't understand, sir. This is extremely frustrating. 
PICARD: No less so for me. But I promised cooperation, and that's what
we shall give. 
RIKER: Sir.
