HARO TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER WESLEY THOLL CRUSHER DATA

[Ten Forward]

RIKER: I don't know why we're going to this pulsar.
And creeping up on it at half impulse makes even less sense. 
TROI: The Captain has given unusual orders before. 
RIKER: I know, but this is different. He's different. I can't put my
finger on it, but I'm worried. 
TROI: The Captain does seem detached from his emotions. 
(Picard enters and goes to the bar) 
PICARD 2: Mister La Forge. We are operating at ninety six percent
engine efficiency. Well done. 
LAFORGE: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD 2: When we arrive at the pulsar, I shall require everyone at
their best. I know that I can rely on both of you. 
WORF: Of course, Captain. 
PICARD 2: Excellent. An ale for me, and for my officers. In fact, ales
for everyone. 
(General ah's and thanks) 
PICARD 2: Here's to the finest crew in Starfleet. You know, back when I
was in the Academy, we would follow every toast with a song. I wonder
if I can,
oh, yes. 
(Clears his throat and starts to sing Hearts of Oaks) 
PICARD 2: Come cheer up my lads, 'Tis to glory we steer. To find
something new in this wonderful year. To honour we call you as free men
and brave. For who are so free as the sons of the waves? Hearts of Oak
are our ships, Jolly tars are our men. We always are ready. Steady,
boys, steady. We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again. 
(The verse is repeated with others joining in under the dialogue) 
LAFORGE: Commander, what's the Captain up to? 
RIKER: That's not the Captain I know.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: We're a mission that has no apparent
purpose. In itself, I can accept that. All of us can, because the
Captain says it's important and we trust him. Then he runs the crew
through efficiency drills for the first time in my tour of duty, but he
says we need them, so we need them, because we trust our Captain. But
we also have a captain singing drinking songs with his men. 
LAFORGE: A Captain who's come to the poker game for the first time. 
TROI: And he was very odd with me afterwards. He wanted me to warn him
if the crew started to lose confidence in him. 
RIKER: Any signs of mental stress or trauma? 
CRUSHER: He came in for a physical with no word from me. 
WORF: Anything unusual, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Every test result identical to his last physical, which is
kind of unusual in itself, actually. 
RIKER: Almost as though he wanted to establish that there was nothing
wrong. 
CRUSHER: There was one other thing. He asked me to dinner in his cabin,
and it was a very unusual evening. 
RIKER: Which brings up a very serious possibility. What if there's an
outside influence at work here? 
TROI: I detect no evidence of telepathic coercion. 
DATA: Commander, there is still one fact we have not considered. The
abnormal energy reading in the Captain's quarters was never explained. 
WORF: It is not enough evidence to justify mutiny. 
RIKER: Nobody has suggested removing the Captain from command. Right
now, all we have are suspicions. Not enough to act upon. The next move
is his.

[Holding cell]

THOLL: Well, Picard? Prove to us you're not the
enemy. 
PICARD: I can't. You're right, Mister Tholl. Any of us may be the
enemy. And there is no way to prove that we aren't. But until we set
aside our mutual fears and trust one another, we have no hope of
escape. 
HARO: But sir, how can we trust each other? 
THOLL: She's right. There may be an enemy among us. 
PICARD: And what if there is, Mister Tholl? Shall we continue accusing
one another until hostility leads to violence? Shall we allow our
suspicions to destroy us? Now, let's see if we can override this stun
mechanism. 
[Bridge]

PICARD 2: Helm take us in to twenty million
kilometres. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, divert enough power to the shields to offset the
increased radiation and magnetic fields. 
DATA: Sir, at twenty million kilometres, our shields will only be
effective for eighteen minutes. 
PICARD 2: Noted, Mister Data. 
RIKER: Captain, may I have a word with you? 
PICARD 2: You have the Bridge, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Ready room]

RIKER: What is our mission? 
PICARD 2: I'm under no obligation to tell you that. 
RIKER: If you don't, you force me to take command of this vessel. 
PICARD 2: On what grounds? 
RIKER: You are endangering this ship for no reason. 
PICARD 2: No reason you're aware of. 
RIKER: That's not good enough. Your behaviour has been erratic. 
PICARD 2: Erratic enough to justify mutiny? Do you honestly believe you
have sufficient evidence to convince a board of inquiry? 
RIKER: No, I don't. But I can't let you risk the lives of this crew. 
PICARD 2: Number One, has it occurred to you that you might be the one
with the problem? I'm aware you've been under stress, and I am willing
to let the matter drop if you will report to Sickbay for a full
examination. Otherwise, I will have to relieve you from duty. Think
about it.
