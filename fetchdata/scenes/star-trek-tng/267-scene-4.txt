RIKER [OC]: By oh nine hundred hours. 
LAFORGE: Ensign, you'll write that report. 
TAURIK: Yes, sir.

RIKER: What happened back there, Ensign? 
SITO: I'm sorry, sir. When we changed course I had to re-lock phasers
before I could fire. 
RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual
order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,
but it works. 
SITO: Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: Lavelle. 
LAVELLE: Sir? 
RIKER: Resume previous course and speed. 
LAVELLE: Aye, aye, sir. 
RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. 
LAVELLE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement? 
PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss it
in the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. 
RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
(Riker, Data, Worf and Picard leave) 
SITO: The Argaya system's close to the Cardassian border. I wonder why
we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table? 
LAVELLE: What? 
SITO: A spider under the table. 
LAVELLE: Is that like a fly on the wall? 
SITO: I guess so. You did really well during the drill. 
LAVELLE: Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's
got it in for me. 
SITO: You're imagining things. 
LAVELLE: Yeah? Then how come you're sitting in that chair instead of
me? 
SITO: I guess he figured I need more practice than you do.

TAURIK: Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute? 
LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it? 
TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something. 
LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign? 
TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to
test a new warp field configuration. 
LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is
out of sync. 
TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this
configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven
percent. 
LAFORGE: You're right. 
TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at
the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything
about this. 
TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a
preliminary report when I was at the Academy. 
LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it 
TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will
become a new model for warp field operation. 
LAFORGE: Sounds interesting. 
TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if
the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. 
LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for. 
TAURIK: I was quite thorough. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation
before I authorise any tests. 
TAURIK: As you wish. 
LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't
hesitate to run them by me. 
TAURIK: As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time to
discuss them? 
LAFORGE: I'll get back to you on that.
