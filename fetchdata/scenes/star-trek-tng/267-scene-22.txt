ambassador guess schedule beamed disagree let escape telling talk

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(five card stud game in progress) 
BEN: It's your bet, Taurik. What I can't understand is why we're just
sitting here so close to the Cardassian border. 
LAVELLE: It must have something to do with that escape pod we picked
up. Don't you think, Sito? 
SITO: Maybe. 
LAVELLE: I wonder who was in it? 
BEN: You know what I heard? It was Ambassador Spock. 
TAURIK: That is most unlikely. 
BEN: That's what I was told. 
TAURIK: By whom? 
BEN: I can't say. 
LAVELLE: They beamed whoever was in it right to Sickbay. Did you see
anything when you went down there? 
OGAWA: No. Doctor Crusher just asked me to help her with the laboratory
schedule. 
TAURIK: I thought Lieutenant Powell was going to join us tonight? 
OGAWA: He had to do a double shift. 
LAVELLE: That's too bad. He must be the worst poker player I've ever
met. 
BEN: It's your bet, Sam. 
(with four clubs showing, Lavelle checks his hole card and grins)

[Riker's quarters]

(another poker game) 
WORF: Twenty. 
CRUSHER: The thing is, I saw Powell in Ten Forward with another woman,
and the way they were talking it made me wonder. 
TROI: Well, if he's seeing someone else he should tell Alyssa. I mean,
it might hurt her now, but it would be better in the long run. 
RIKER: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. I
don't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position. 
WORF: Well, I must say I disagree, sir. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor. Pair of fours bets. 
RIKER: I'm listening. 
[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

BEN: The bet is fifty. 
TAURIK: It would be illogical for the Captain to deny you a promotion
for something you did as a cadet. 
SITO: He said it shows I don't have character. 
OGAWA: What did you say? 
SITO: What could I say? Maybe he's right. 
LAVELLE: Hey, you're a damn fine officer and you deserve that post as
much as anyone. One thing's for sure, I won't be getting it. Not if
it's up to Riker.

[Riker's quarters]

WORF: It is your decision, sir, but I am certain if
you give Ensign Sito a chance to prove herself, she will not disappoint
you. 
RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm not
convinced about Lavelle. 
TROI: Really? Why? 
RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiate
himself to me. 
TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job? 
LAFORGE: Fifty. 
RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more. 
TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lot
alike. 
RIKER: What? We're not at all alike. 
LAFORGE: You're bluffing.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

LAVELLE: You think so? 
BEN: Yes, and I'm not going to let you get away with it. 
OGAWA: You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't try so hard with Riker. It
doesn't matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you. 
SITO: He must, otherwise he would not be considering you for the Ops
position. 
LAVELLE: You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates
me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse. 
BEN: You in or not? 
TAURIK: At this juncture, the odds of my winning this hand are less
than thirty nine to one. I fold.

[Riker's quarters]

LAFORGE: The Commander's flush is still working. No
help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. And Jacks and fours for the
Counsellor. Ah, three sixes. 
WORF: Fold. 
RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking. Give me a second, here. 
TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the
officer's game at the Potemkin? 
RIKER: I happen to like poker. 
TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to
ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were
young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. 
RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. 
WORF: I do not believe he is bluffing. 
LAFORGE: I do. There you go. What've you got? 
WORF: Flush. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe this. 
RIKER: I am your worst nightmare.
