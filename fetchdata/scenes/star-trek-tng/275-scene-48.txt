TROI CONDUCTOR LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER RUSTIC DATA

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Matter conversion. It's incredible. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute, something's wrong. We've got power fluctuations.
Vertion absorption rate is dropping. What's happening to the particle
beam? 
[Bridge]

RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particles
in the star. There's nothing left to take out. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain 
[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: The energy output of the object is
decreasing. 
[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Something's wrong. 
WORF: What is it? 
CONDUCTOR: This was supposed to be Vertiform City. (the beam disengages
and the object stops glowing) 
CONDUCTOR: We've been on the wrong track all along. 
(the Conductor pulls the brake lever and everyone gets thrown around)

[Holodeck- train]

WORF: Are you all right? 
TROI: Yes. What happened? 
WORF: The Conductor accidently derailed the train. 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. 
[Cargo bay]

PICARD: Picard here. 
DATA [OC]: There has been an accident on the holodeck, sir. Has
anything happened to the Enterprise? 
PICARD: Yes, we've had a ship-wide shutdown. We've lost attitude
control and most systems are offline. 
LAFORGE: Captain, you'd better take a look at this. When the particle
beam cut off, the object was beginning to form a coherent energy
matrix. Now, if these readings are accurate, I'd say that the emission
patterns were almost organic. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is trying to create a
lifeform? 
LAFORGE: I think so. 
PICARD: Will it survive? 
LAFORGE: Well, its energy levels are dropping rapidly. Unless it gets
an infusion of vertion particles, and I mean soon, I don't think so. 
(rumble, and Geordi checks a console) 
LAFORGE: Captain, all of our systems are back online and we're moving
again, at warp nine. 
PICARD: Let's get back to the Bridge.

[Holodeck- train]

(everything's back to normal) 
RUSTIC: Whoo wee, that was a close one, wasn't it? 
TROI: Where are we going now? 
RUSTIC: Well, New Vertiform City, of course. 
DATA: Data to Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard here. 
DATA: The train has returned to normal, sir. Our destination is New
Vertiform City.

[Bridge]

PICARD: What's our course? 
RIKER: We're heading for the Cordannas system. 
PICARD: Another white dwarf star. 
RIKER: It's the nearest one to our last position. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we have a problem. Even at warp nine, the Cordannas
system is over twelve hours from here. 
PICARD: Will the object in the cargo bay survive that long? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, but that's not the problem. The ship has diverted
all of our systems to maximum propulsion, including life support. We
have less than two hours of reserve oxygen. 
PICARD: Mister Data, we have to stop the Enterprise. That means you
have to get control of the train. 
DATA [OC]: Understood, sir. 
PICARD: The ship is looking for vertion particles and it believes that
the Cordannas system is the closest source. Is there any possibility of
anything closer? 
LAFORGE: White dwarf stars are the only natural sources of vertions,
sir. 
PICARD: Then what about artificial ones? Can you create the particles?
