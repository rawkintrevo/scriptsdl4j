[Timicin's quarters]

TIMICIN: Come in. 
(Lwaxana enters) 
TIMICIN: I've been studying the preliminary reports of the test. I
don't understand where I went wrong. I thought I'd taken into account
all of the variables. Deep convection patterns, proton reactions,
neutrino count. 
(Lwaxana rubs his back and shoulders) 
TIMICIN: I will say it again. You are a kind woman. 
LWAXANA: No, no, I'm a hateful woman. I hate what you're going to do,
and I hate you for doing it. 
TIMICIN: It is the way of my world. I wish you could accept that. 
LWAXANA: I never will. Never. 
(they kiss) 
(later, Lwaxana is wearing a loose robe and a big smile, as Timicin
wakes up) 
TIMICIN: How long have you been sitting there? 
LWAXANA: I don't know. A minute. An hour. 
TIMICIN: Lwaxana 
LWAXANA: Do you want anything? Some tea? 
TIMICIN: I want to explain. I want very much for you to understand.
Fifteen or twenty centuries ago, we had no Resolution. We had no such
concern for our elders. As people aged, their health failed, they
became invalids. Those whose families could no longer care for them
were put away in deathwatch facilities, where they waited in loneliness
for the end to come, sometimes for years. They had meant something, and
they were forced to live beyond that, into a time of meaning nothing,
of knowing they could now only be the beneficiaries of younger people's
patience. We are no longer that cruel, Lwaxana. 
LWAXANA: No, no, you're not cruel to them. You just kill them. 
TIMICIN: The Resolution is a celebration of life. It allows us to end
our lives with dignity. 
LWAXANA: A celebration of life. It sounds very noble, very caring. What
you're really saying is you got rid of the problem by getting rid of
the people. 
TIMICIN: It may sound that way, but it is a time of transition. One
generation passing on the responsibilities of life to the next. 
LWAXANA: What about the responsibility of caring of the elderly? 
TIMICIN: That would place a dreadful burden on the children. 
LWAXANA: We raise them, we care for them, we suffer for them. We keep
them from harm their whole lives. Eventually, it's their turn to take
care of us. 
TIMICIN: No parent should expect to be paid back for the love they've
given their children. 
LWAXANA: Well why the hell not? (to the replicator) Oskoids. 
TIMICIN: What's that? 
LWAXANA: (eating) Oskoids. A Betazed delicacy. 
TIMICIN: Looks very interesting. 
LWAXANA: You should have tried it while you were still alive. No reason
to bother now. Why sixty? Why not sixty two, or fifty eight? 
TIMICIN: A reasonable age had to be set. 
LWAXANA: But it's not reasonable. Certainly not in your case. You're as
vital and healthy a man as I've ever known. 
TIMICIN: That is why I wish to say goodbye to my family and colleagues
while I am this way, in complete command of my faculties, knowing they
will always remember me as a strong and vigorous man. 
LWAXANA: But it makes no sense. Some of your people could still be
active at seventy or eighty, and others might be seriously ill at
fifty. How cruel of you to make them wait so long to commit suicide. 
TIMICIN: Setting a standard age for the Resolution makes it uniform for
everybody. To ask individual families to decide when their elders are
to die, that would be heartless. 
LWAXANA: I agree. Why not let everybody die when they die. 
TIMICIN: Lwaxana. 
LWAXANA: You have a grandson, you said. 
TIMICIN: Yes, almost seven. 
LWAXANA: Well, wouldn't it be better for him to know his grandfather?
Not some vague memory of someone who once loved him, but a real living
person who does love him. Don't you really think that would be better? 
TIMICIN: I attended the Resolution of my parents when it was their
time. It was beautiful. Lwaxana, this is a custom I've known and
accepted all my life. 
LWAXANA: The women of Betazed used to wear these enormous wigs with
large holes in the cenre for tiny caged animals. 
TIMICIN: Yes. 
LWAXANA: First, it was a fashion. Then it went on long enough to become
a custom, a tradition. But it was uncomfortable for the woman and
cruel to the animal. So then one day, one very formidable woman finally
said so, refused ever to wear another of those wigs. fairly soon the
custom stopped. She had the courage to stand up and fight for change. 
TIMICIN: She must have been a lot like you. 
LWAXANA: Timicin, there is no one more qualified, more experienced, or
more likely to save their planet than you. And they would have you kill
yourself. 
TIMICIN: Younger scientists will take my place. My work, the work will
continue. 
LWAXANA: Your planet has what, thirty, forty years left? What if your
scientists can't find the answer without you? What then? What chance do
you think your grandson has of reaching the age of sixty? 
TIMICIN: Enough, please. It is my time, Lwaxana, and that is the way it
is. 
LWAXANA: If that's the way it is, I don't know why anyone's bothering
to try to save your world at all. If its time has come, let it die.
Where's the difference, Timicin? Where?
