NELLA RIKER CRUSHER DATA PICARD

[Ten Forward]

(the raised area in front of the windows is the
stage. Data and a cellist enter, then the pianist, Nella. Troi picks up
Picard's emotions during the performance) 
(afterwards, at the bar) PICARD: Thank you. 
NELLA: Well done, Mister Data. Well done. 
PICARD: Commander, that was a remarkable performance. 
CRUSHER: You are very talented. 
NELLA: Thank you. 
DATA: I noticed that the applause this evening exceeded average decibel
levels. 
NELLA: I guess that means they enjoyed themselves. 
PICARD: I think that much was obvious. 
DATA: Excuse me. I have not yet congratulated Ensign Cheney. 
CRUSHER: I'll go with you. 
PICARD: Commander, you must have been playing since you were young. I
played the piano for a while when I was small, but I didn't put in the
practice you must have. 
NELLA: Practising was never my problem. In fact, my parents had to make
me go out and play. 
PICARD: I wanted to ask, during the second arpeggio in the first
movement, I noticed that you played an F minor chord instead of a
diminished D. 
NELLA: You're a musician. What's your instrument? We should play some
time. 
PICARD: No, no, no, I'm just an amateur. But your choice in that
arpeggio was delightful. Not at all what one would expect. 
NELLA: Well, Captain, now that I'm on your ship, maybe you should start
expecting the unexpected.

[Bridge]

(at the nebula) 
NELLA: Excuse me, sir. I was hoping that my people in Spectral Analysis
could have another few hours on the main sensor array? 
RIKER: I'm sorry, the array has already been allocated to Engineering.
They're running some warp field tests. 
NELLA: If we go offline now, we'll lose the gas flow pattern we've been
tracking. 
RIKER: I understand, but there are other departments waiting to use the
array. 
NELLA: We're at a critical juncture, sir. 
RIKER: Commander. I'll see what I can do to find you some more time
tomorrow. 
NELLA: Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Thank you, sir.

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is listening to the 3rd Brandenburg with an
unfamiliar instrument in it, when the doorbell chimes) 
PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren. 
NELLA: I hope you don't mind me dropping by like this? 
PICARD: No, please, come in. I'm delighted. 
NELLA: What kind of flute is that? 
PICARD: It's Ressikan. 
NELLA: I've never saw one before. 
PICARD: They're not made anymore. 
NELLA: Have you been playing long? 
PICARD: Er, yes, a long time. 
NELLA: I'd love to hear you play sometime. 
PICARD: I'm not very good. 
NELLA: That doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. 
PICARD: Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. 
NELLA: May I try? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I? 
NELLA: Please. 
(Picard plays one of his plaintive melodies) 
NELLA: You're better than you think. Really. We should play together. 
PICARD: There isn't a piano. 
NELLA: Ah, but there is. 
(she unrolls a keyboard on the coffee table) 
NELLA: I picked it up on Mataline Two. It's amazing. 
(a quick grand piano arpeggio) 
PICARD: That is remarkable. Why don't you play something? 
NELLA: You start and I'll jump in. 
PICARD: What shall we play? 
NELLA: What were you working on before I came in? 
PICARD: Bach, the third Brandenburg. 
NELLA: Perfect. Go ahead. 
(Picard starts, but gets lost when she joins in) 
PICARD: I'm sorry. 
NELLA: It's all right. You're not used to playing with anyone, are you?

PICARD: Just the computer. 
NELLA: I may not be as precise as a computer, but I think you'll enjoy
it more. Why don't we start with something a little simpler. How about?

(she plays Frere Jacque and they do the roundel) 
NELLA: Good. Very good. Now let's have a little fun with it. 
(she plays it with minor variations, and Picard's eyes pop) 
NELLA: You try it. Improvise around the melody. Anything you want. 
(he does) 
NELLA: That's wonderful. Keep going. It's so good. 
(they play it though) 
NELLA: You're definitely better than you think.
