[Outside Holodeck]

COMPUTER: Programme Crusher four in progress.

[Holodeck dance studio]

(Parquet floor, windows, potted palms and wall
mirrors. Beverly is wearing tap shoes) 
CRUSHER: Hi, Data. Well what do you think? It is a recreation of the
studio I had my first dance lesson in. 
DATA: It appears to be quite suitable, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Let's start with something simple. Stomp. Hop. Try it. 
(he does) 
CRUSHER: Again. Good! Good. 
DATA: Am I dancing, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Not quite. Stop, Data. Now try this. 
DATA: Doctor, perhaps it would be beneficial to show me the final
lesson. 
CRUSHER: Okay. 
(so she goes into a tap routine and he copies her exactly) 
CRUSHER: That's great. Watch. Good. Triples. Watch. Stop, Data. And you
say you've never done this before? Try this. 
(she does advanced steps and he copies her perfectly) 
CRUSHER: Stop, Data. Not bad. (out of breath) Yeah, not bad. 
DATA: Then I have successfully learned to dance? 
CRUSHER: I'd say you've picked up the basics. 
DATA: Thank you, Doctor. I am now prepared to dance at the wedding. 
CRUSHER: Wedding? 
DATA: Keiko's wedding. 
CRUSHER: Data, you never told me this was for the wedding. 
DATA: Is that important? 
CRUSHER: Well yes. They don't do a lot of tap dancing at weddings. 
DATA: Why? 
CRUSHER: Well, Data, because, I don't really know why, Look, why don't
I just teach you a style of dancing that they will do at the wedding?
Computer, run 'Isn't It Romantic'. 
(The slow music starts, and Beverly gets Data into a close ballroom
hold) 
CRUSHER: Compared to what we've just doing, this will be simple. Just
look up and follow me. One, two, ready, and 
(he is useless, no rhythm, and he treads on her toes) 
CRUSHER: No, Data, wait a minute. Ow! No, no, you're just. Ow! Move
slowly. Ow! Ow! Stop music. 
DATA: Sorry, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I don't understand, Data. You picked up the tap dancing so
quickly. 
DATA: I cannot reproduce your performance if I cannot see your feet. 
CRUSHER: All right, let's try it again. And this time, watch my feet.
Computer, start music. And. 
(This is far better, and less painful) 
CRUSHER: Now, don't just imitate me. You've got to lead. 
DATA: Lead where, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Indicate to your partner where you want her to step. 
DATA: And how is that accomplished? 
CRUSHER: I'll show you. I'll lead. Now, you'll notice that I don't just
repeat the same pattern over and over. I improvise. Now you lead.
That's good. Now, look up, Data. Look into my eyes. You're holding me
too tight. 
DATA: This is a very complex set of variables to coordinate, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: You are doing fine. Now, smile. Act like you're enjoying
yourself 
NURSE [OC]: Doctor Crusher, please report to Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: Is it Lieutenant Juarez? 
NURSE [OC]: Yes, Doctor. Her contractions are now one minute apart. 
CRUSHER: I'm on my way. Why don't you programme up an artificial dance
partner. And don't be afraid to experiment. 
DATA: I will. Thank you, Doctor. 
DATA: Computer, create dance partner. Female. Begin music.
