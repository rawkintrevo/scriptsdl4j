[Guest quarters - bedroom]

PERRIN: You are still unable to meditate? 
SAREK: It is of no importance. 
PERRIN: It has eluded you for many weeks. 
SAREK: I said it is of no importance. 
PERRIN: You know I am right. 
SAREK: My wife, you will leave me now. I require solitude.

[Conference room]

WESLEY: The temperature in the tank is now one
hundred fifty degrees Celsius. 
LAFORGE: Okay, lock it off. 
WESLEY: Is that it? Can I get out of here now? 
LAFORGE: What's your hurry? You don't really think something's going to
happen with Suzanne Dumont, do you? 
WESLEY: At least I'm not spending the night with a good book like some
people. 
LAFORGE: What's that supposed to mean? 
WESLEY: Just what it sounds like. 
LAFORGE: Let me tell you something. You'd get more action out of a good
book than you'll ever see on this date, I'll guarantee it. She's not
going to waste her time on someone like you. 
WESLEY: Someone like me? 
LAFORGE: She's way out of your league. 
WESLEY: Since when did you become an expert on women? 
LAFORGE: Compared to you, every male on this ship is an expert on
women. 
WESLEY: Well at least I don't have to find my women on the holodeck! 
LAFORGE: What did you say? 
WESLEY: You heard me! 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I heard you. Just what do you think is going to stop 
RIKER: Something wrong? I asked a question. 
LAFORGE: No, sir. Nothing wrong here. 
WESLEY: May I be excused, Commander? 
(Wesley storms out) 
RIKER: Anything you'd like to talk about, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: No, sir.
