seronia rohm biology floor later reports crew does feelings

[Corridor]

ALKAR: Tell me, Counsellor, have you ever been
involved in diplomatic negotiations?
TROI: Several times with Captain Picard. There have been instances when
having an empath along has been helpful.
ALKAR: I'm sure. I could use some of that help. Would you come with me
when we reach Seronia?
TROI: If the Captain authorises it, of course I will.
ALKAR: Good. I hope to see you again.
(the door opens) 
MAYLOR: You're late.
ALKAR: Mother, I told you that I'd be gone for over an hour.
MAYLOR: You're late because of her. Have you mated with him yet?
TROI: What?
MAYLOR: That's what you want, isn't it?
ALKAR: Mother, please, come in. 
MAYLOR: I can always tell. The ones with a certain look in their eye. 
TROI: I'd better go.
MAYLOR: And I'll tell you this. If you do, you'll regret it the rest of
your life.
ALKAR: Mother. come in please. You should lie down. 
[Troi's office]

TROI: Come in.
RIKER: Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew evaluation reports.
TROI: Does it have to be today?
RIKER: It's not going to be any easier tomorrow.
TROI: It might.
RIKER: What's wrong?
TROI: I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. She
frightens me, Will. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent.
They're out of proportion. They're evil.
RIKER: I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile.
Who knows, we could all end up that way some day.
TROI: You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations, and when
they're done I'm going to reward myself with two ice cream sundaes.
RIKER: First, molecular biology. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis. 
WORF [OC]: Worf to Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Go ahead.
WORF [OC]: Can you report to Ambassador Alkar's quarters? There is an
emergency. 
RIKER: We're on our way. 
[Alkar's quarters]

(Maylor is rigid on the floor) 
CRUSHER: Forty cc's inaprovaline.
RIKER: I'm sorry, Ambassador.
ALKAR: She was ill. I should never have brought her along. She was
ninety three. She'd lived a long life. I should be grateful for that. 
TROI: Alkar, is there anything I can do? 
ALKAR: Counsellor, there's a funeral meditation. Part of our rituals.
As an empath, you're the only person on board who could perform it with
me.
TROI: I'll be glad to help. 
(later - the room is darkened, and Alkar takes a pair of crystals from
a box) 
ALKAR: This meditation is one of our most sacred ceremonies. Hold the
stone like this. Rohm gah sevi rohm. Say after me. An end to grief.
TROI: An end to grief.
ALKAR: An end to pain.
TROI: An end to pain.
ALKAR: Strength comes from love.
TROI: Strength comes from love.
ALKAR: And courage from wisdom.
TROI: And courage from wisdom.
(Alkar moves his crystal towards Troi's, and it glows. When they touch,
both crystals glow, then just Troi's. Her eyes snap open in horror.) 
ALKAR: Thank you.
