DATA: You wanted to see me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes, Data. I need to ask you to do something for me. I'm
working on a new experiment with bioactive silicon. Would you
reprogram this tricorder to these specifications? 
DATA: Certainly. 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry to bother you with it, but I need it done quickly. 
DATA: It does not bother me. In fact, I am happy to

on a biobed) 
RIKER: Computer, secure Sickbay. 
COMPUTER: All entries to Sickbay are secured.

(a chat over afternoon tea served in the silver tea
service) 
WESLEY: Let's see. I have Novakovich for anthropology and Horne for
creative writing. 
PICARD: Walter Horne? Is he still teaching? 
WESLEY: Yeah, he is. And he's good too. And you'll be pleased to know I
took your advice. The first week that I was there, I went and met
Boothby. 
PICARD: How is old Boothby? I hope he didn't tell you a lot of stories
about me. 
WESLEY: He didn't remember you, sir. At first. I found an old yearbook
photo and he remembered you right away. He said he's very proud of you
that you're Captain of the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Is he still tending grounds, or have the years finally caught
up with him? 
WESLEY: Not that I can tell. He took me on a grand tour of the place.
He showed
me every single blade of grass, practically. 
PICARD: I had the very same tour. 
WESLEY: Sir, what do the initials A F stand for? 
PICARD: AF? 
WESLEY: Boothby said he caught you carving those initials into his
prized elm tree. 
PICARD: AF. Just an acquaintance of mine. (goes misty) Wesley, if you
meet someone whose initials you might want to carve into that elm tree,
don't let it interfere with your studies. I failed organic chemistry
because of AF. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I need you in Sickbay immediately. 
PICARD: On my way.
