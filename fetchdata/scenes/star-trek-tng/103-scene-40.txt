RIKER WORF TASHA PICARD TROI DATA MACDOUGAL SECURITY

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out of
Engineering. 
(Riker and MacDougal leave) 
WORF: Sir, I'm getting very strange reports from all decks. 
PICARD: Such as? 
WORF: Such as the ship's Training Division ordering all officers to
attend a lecture on metaphysics. 
PICARD: Metaphysics? 
DATA: Confirmed, sir. And there was a rather peculiar limerick being
delivered by someone in the Shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure I
understand it. There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shaped
like 
PICARD: Captain to Security, come in! 
DATA: Did I say something wrong? 
WORF: I don't understand their humour either. 
SECURITY [OC]: Yeah, Captain? 
PICARD: Where is my security chief! Get me Lieutenant Yar. 
SECURITY [OC]: Keep your britches on. 
TASHA [OC]: (lilting) Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, where are you? 
TASHA [OC]: I'm in my quarters, and I'm pretty busy right at the
moment, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: All right, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, please
go to Lieutenant Yar and take her down to Sickbay. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Data leaves) 
PICARD: Captain to Security, I want all your senior supervisors to
report to the Bridge immediately.

[Tasha's Quarters]

(We hear giggling as Data enters cautiously) 
DATA: Lieutenant Yar? 
TASHA: Here, Data. You wanted me? 
(She has slicked down her hair, and is wearing a curious outfit that
leaves the ribcage and stomach bare) 
DATA: Captain Picard ordered me to escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Did he say when? 
DATA: I am sure he meant now. So, you need time to get into uniform. 
TASHA: But I got out of uniform for you, Data. Do you know how old I
was when I was abandoned? 
DATA: Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not familiar with 
TASHA: Five. Five years old, but I survived. I learned how to stay
alive, how to avoid the rape gangs. I was fifteen before I escaped. 
DATA: I am sorry. I did not know, 
TASHA: And what I want now is gentleness. And joy. And love. From you,
Data. You are fully functional, aren't you? 
DATA: Of course, but 
TASHA: How fully? 
DATA: In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques,
a broad variety of pleasuring, 
TASHA: Oh, you jewel! That's exactly what I hoped. 
(She leads him into the bedroom and sits him down on the bed)

PICARD [OC]: What have you learned, Number One? 
RIKER: Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. The
Assistant Chief Engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from
command. All engines are offline. Wesley has hooked some kind of
tractor beam to ship's power and he has it aimed at the door. We can't
get past to get at the computer. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Can you short out the power? 
[Engineering]

MACDOUGAL: Yes, I can. But it's going to take some
time.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do it!

[Engineering ]

TROI: Bill.
RIKER: Deanna, what? 
TROI: So many minds on this ship, all free. Released, 
RIKER: Deanna. 
(She strokes his chest) 
TROI: I can feel them all. What they want, what they feel. It's a side
of humans I've never felt before. 
RIKER: Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay. 
(He picks her up and carries her) 
TROI: Wouldn't you rather be alone with me? With me in your mind?
