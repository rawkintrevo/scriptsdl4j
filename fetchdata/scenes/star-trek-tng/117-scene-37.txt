[Luisa's quarters]

(Luisa has been crying when the door bell rings) 
LUISA: It's not locked. 
RIKER: Mind a visitor? 
LUISA: Is it true? Did you really find a life form? 
RIKER: The debate is still going on in some quarters, but I think so,
yes. 
LUISA: What's it like? 
RIKER: We have nothing we can compare it with. It's microscopic. It
seems colonial, simple. But it's inorganic. Which is why the recon
scouts missed it. It was not your mistake. 
LUISA: Everything I've worked so hard for is falling apart. 
RIKER: Luisa, it's very beautiful. I could arrange for you to see it if
you like. 
LUISA: Perhaps later.

[Bridge]

(The image from the lab is on the viewscreen) 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, this is Doctor Crusher. I think you'd better
come to the Medical Lab.

[Medical lab]

PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi observed movement. 
LAFORGE: Not movement exactly, but a definite shift in the energy
pattern. 
DATA: Without external influence. 
PICARD: The hum has gone too. Why? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. Perhaps it is scanning us. 
PICARD: Scanning us? Why? What could it hope to learn? 
DATA: Unknown at this time, sir. 
LAFORGE: It's changing. 
PICARD: I don't see anything. 
LAFORGE: The infrared range is increasing. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Input overload. 
CRUSHER: The hum is back. 
DATA: It is projecting an energy field. 
LAFORGE: And it's intensifying! 
COMPUTER: Magnification deactivated. 
(Now there are two bright lights in the bell jar, instead of one) 
CRUSHER: Two of them! 
DATA: Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it is
alive. 
CRUSHER: Activate quarantine field. (but something is pushing against
it) Quarantine field full. Full shield backup! 
(The shield fails) 
CRUSHER: Evacuating lab. 
COMPUTER: Translation request being patched. 
PICARD: Translation? From whom? 
COMPUTER: (gibberish) 
CRUSHER: Evacuate. 
[Corridor]

WESLEY: What's wrong on with the translator
circuit? 
PICARD: Bridge, this is the Captain. Request emergency power to
initiate lab quarantine seal.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Do it, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: What's the nature of the problem, Captain? We've lost visual. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: We have confirmed that Data's discovery is
life. But more than that, it is intelligent life. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: How do you know, sir? 

[Corridor]

PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us.

Captain's log, supplemental. The inorganic life
form from Velara Three has apparently taken over our Medical Lab.

[Bridge]

WORF: It generates enough energy to interfere with
the surrounding systems. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, can we see into the lab yet? 
LAFORGE: Negative, Captain. Reducing the backup to the quarantine seal
might help. 
PICARD: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I wouldn't. 
PICARD: Continue quarantine. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
TASHA [OC]: Director Mandl and the others are in the Observation Lounge
as you requested. 
PICARD: Counsellor, I shall need you. You have the Bridge, Number One.

[Observation Lounge]

PICARD: Director Mandl, I put it to you again. What
do you know about these life forms? 
MANDL: Not a thing. 
PICARD: Enough! Sit down, Lieutenant. You are deliberately evasive and
it must stop. You have kept information from me since our first
communication. An alien life form has taken possession of my Medical
Lab. You knew of its existence. 
MANDL: Yes. 
LUISA: Is this true? You knew there was life on Velara Three? 
MANDL: I knew that there were random energy patterns, yes, I knew that.
But not life. Not by any definition I have ever heard. 
TROI: But you tried to keep that knowledge from us. 
MANDL: No! They are meaningless silicon crystals, which rebroadcast
sunlight. 
PICARD: It is a life form and it has intelligence. 
MANDL: Why do you say that? 
PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. 
MANDL: Communicate with you? 
PICARD: When did you first become aware of them? 
BENSEN: Tell them about the pattern in the sand. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. Do tell us. 
BENSEN: When we first arrived, we noticed that in certain areas the
sand had a sparkling effect, like sunlight bouncing off new fallen snow.
PICARD: What did you think it was? 
BENSEN: Honestly, we did not give it any thought. 
MANDL: Picard, I must point out again that we were assured, not once
but many times, by the best scientific minds in the Federation, that
this planet has no life. No life! And we were not looking, and
therefore we did not see. 
PICARD: All right. At first you dismissed it. But then you began to
understand that there was something that was different about them. 
MANDL: You can't know that. 
PICARD: Your apprehension suggested it, when we first arrived. Tell me
about these patterns. 
BENSEN: At first we thought it was just a natural phenomenon unique to
Velara Three. 
MANDL: Refraction and a thin atmosphere is interesting, but certainly
not life. 
LUISA: Why was I never told about this? 
MANDL: Because it's not particularly important. 
BENSEN: As the building of the terraforming station went forward, the
patterns in the sand ceased being random and became very specific.
Geometric shapes suddenly appearing, disappearing, changing location,
changing size. 
PICARD: Did you ever feel that these patterns were attempting to
communicate? 
MANDL: No, never. 
PICARD: Bensen? 
BENSEN: I don't know. At the time, I didn't think so. But now, after
hearing what you just said. Now, I don't know. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we've regained magnification of the life form.
It's divided again. 
PICARD: Patch visual to Observation lounge.
(Eight round things with a bar pattern are on the screen) 
MANDL: There was no indication of any of this on Velara Three. 
BENSEN: Absolutely none. 
[Bridge]

(working at the rear science stations) 
WORF: I cannot understand the patterns. 
LAFORGE: Neither can I. 
DATA: Please show me the spectral analysis magnification twelve K. 
COMPUTER: Silicon. Germanium. 
DATA: Transistor material. 
COMPUTER: Gallium arsenide. 
LAFORGE: Emits light when charged. 
COMPUTER: Cadmium selenide sulfide. 
DATA: Emits charge when lit. 
COMPUTER: Water, impurities, sodium salts. 
WORF: Conductor. But is it alive?! 
COMPUTER: Probability positive. 
WORF: I wasn't asking you. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Engineering to Bridge. 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker, go ahead.
