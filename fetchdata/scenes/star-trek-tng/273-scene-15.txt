RIKER KMTAR WORF YOG TROI LURSA DATA BETOR

[Bridge]

DATA: I am detecting a vessel holding position near
the third planet. It is a Yridian freighter. 
RIKER: Put it on screen. Scan for magnesite in its hold. 
DATA: The resonance signature indicates that there is magnesite ore
present. 
RIKER: Then we're too late. The sisters have already been here. 
TROI: Somehow I doubt the Yridians are going to be forthcoming about
where they might have gone. 
DATA: Sir, readings indicate that there are only five hundred kilograms
of ore in the Yridian hold. 
WORF: There should be over ten thousand kilograms. 
RIKER: That's odd. Hail them. I'm Commander William Riker from the
Federation Starship Enterprise. 
YOG [on viewscreen]: I am Yog. Why are we speaking? 
RIKER: Our sensors indicate that you're carrying magnesite ore. 
YOG [on viewscreen]: Magnesite, yes. 
RIKER: Where did you get it? 
YOG [on viewscreen]: From a Corvallen. For a good price. 
RIKER: Where is this Corvallen now? I'm under orders to acquire some
magnesite. 
YOG [on viewscreen]: He is gone. Where? Who is to know? 
RIKER: Would you be interested in selling me the ore you're carrying? 
YOG [on viewscreen]: No, I have a buyer. 
RIKER: You haven't heard my offer. Half a gram of Anjoran biomimetic
gel. 
YOG [on viewscreen]: Done. 
RIKER: Once we verify the purity of your ore, we'll beam over the gel. 
(transmission ends) 
TROI: You're up to something. 
RIKER: Have the transporter room beam the ore to these coordinates. 
DATA: Sir, that would place the ore directly off the ship's starboard
bow. 
RIKER: I know. 
WORF: Transport complete. 
RIKER: Lock phasers on the ore and fire. 
WORF: Firing. 
(the explosion reveals the outline of) 
WORF: A Klingon bird of prey. 
RIKER: Put a tractor beam on it. 
TROI: How did you know? 
RIKER: The Yridians had only part of the shipment in their hold. I
realised we had arrived before they had completed the transfer. 
WORF: The Klingon ship is hailing us. 
RIKER: On screen. 
LURSA [on viewscreen]: Release our vessel at once! 
RIKER: I don't think so. 
B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: We've done nothing wrong. We were engaging in a
simple business transaction. 
RIKER: We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I want to talk about
the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. 
B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: What assassination attempt? This is the first
I've heard of it. 
LURSA [on viewscreen]: Too bad it didn't succeed. 
RIKER: We have evidence that you're behind it. 
LURSA [on viewscreen]: That is outrageous. 
B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: What is this evidence? 
RIKER: Beam over. We'll show you. 
B'ETOR [on viewscreen]: We'll be there. Shortly.

[Observation lounge]

WORF: This was dropped by one of the assassins. It
bears the crest of your house. 
B'ETOR: Ge'ko kaf'la. 
LURSA: Someone must have given it to the assassins to implicate us. 
TROI: Why would someone do that? 
B'ETOR: In order to tarnish our good name. 
WORF: You cannot tarnish a rusted blade. 
LURSA: Ji'ko to'val! 
WORF: Gir'nak tovo'sor! 
RIKER: Mister Worf. You said there was other evidence they were
involved. 
K'MTAR: Yes. On the Homeworld. 
RIKER: We'll set a course. I want this thing cleared up. 
K'MTAR: I will send a message to Kurn. He may wish to return to the
Homeworld as well. 
(K'mtar leaves) 
B'ETOR: Bet'ala nog'tor. 
LURSA: Impossible. 
TROI: What is it? 
B'ETOR: These markings represent the members of our house. This symbol
represents our father, myself, my sister. And this represents her son. 
WORF: I was not aware you had a son. 
LURSA: I do not. But I am with child. 
B'ETOR: She found out only a few days ago and told no one but me. How
can this marking be here? Where did this come from? 
WORF: I will speak with K'mtar.
