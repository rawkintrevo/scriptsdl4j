PICARD CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF

[Promenade]

CRUSHER: I should be through with the water
contaminant analysis in a few hours. Then I'm going to check out one of
the holosuites. They have got a relaxation programme here, Jean-Luc,
from Alture Seven. Listen to this. First they bath you in a protein
bath. Then a cloud of chromal vapour carries you into a meditation
chamber. You should try it. 
PICARD: Well, I'll be too busy discussing the finer points of water
management with ten Bajoran bureaucrats. And they won't be carrying me
on a cloud of chromal vapour. Ops. 
[Replimat]

WORF: What is this? 
LAFORGE: It's pasta al fiorella. One of my favourites. Don't worry,
you'll love it. You know, I really want to take a look at those Ktarian
antiques. I understand they've got a twenty first century plasma coil
in almost perfect condition. (pushes plate away) I'll have to talk to
Chief O'Brien about these replicators. Worf, I don't see how you can
eat that stuff. It tastes like liquid polymer. 
WORF: Delicious. 
LAFORGE: You know, I think I'm going to try that kiosk on the other
side of the promenade. It looked like they had some real food.
