[Corridor]

RIKER: Geordi, wait a second. Thank you, Mister
Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: This is off the record. I'm saying this as a friend, not your
superior officer. I think it would be best if you weren't so personally
involved with Aquiel right now. There's a lot about her we don't know. 
LAFORGE: And there's a lot about her that I do know, and if she's
innocent I want to help her prove it. 
RIKER: I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. 
LAFORGE: I'm not the one making judgements.

[Relay Station ops]

LAFORGE: Got it. Computer, display the personal
records of Lieutenant Rocha from stardates 46455 to 46460. 
(the logs for station 047 scroll through the monitor) 
LAFORGE: Computer, what happened to the log entries for stardate 46459?

COMPUTER: The logs have been deleted. 
LAFORGE: Who deleted them? 
COMPUTER: Unknown. 
Captain's log, supplemental. The Qu'Vat has arrived
with Commander Morag. We are preparing to question him regarding his
involvement in the murder of Lieutenant Rocha.

[Observation lounge]

MORAG: I killed no one! 
RIKER: We found your DNA on the bulkheads and the console. We know you
were there. 
TORAK: Answer their questions. 
MORAG: Yes. Yes, I was there. My patrol route takes me near the station
every six days. Three days ago, I hailed them. There was no response. I
was concerned. 
TROI: Concerned? 
MORAG: Yes. I went aboard to see what had happened. There was no one
was there, so I left. 
RIKER: Is that all? 
MORAG: That's all. 
DATA: Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted message
bank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates that
twenty seven priority Starfleet messages are missing. 
MORAG: What of it? 
DATA: Your DNA was also found on the message control module. 
MORAG: This is outrageous! We will not tolerate these ridiculous
accusations! 
TORAK: This is a diplomatic matter, Morag! Do not make me search your
ship. 
MORAG: Yes, I did take the messages. 
PICARD: Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha? 
MORAG: No. I killed no one. There was no one there. I took the codes,
but I killed no one. 
PICARD: Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain on board the
Enterprise until this investigation is complete. 
TORAK: Take him. 
WORF: This way.
