[Bridge]

RIKER: And just as the headsman swings his axe, the
blade is about to fall (cannot hear above Data's thoughts) 
DATA [OC]: Commander Riker's easy going manner and sense of humour is
fascinating to me. I believe it to be one reason he is so popular among
the crew. It may also be partly responsible for his success in matters
of love. There may be a correlation between humour and sex. The need
for more research is clearly indicated. 
DATA: Commander. 
RIKER: Picard to the Bridge. All stop. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
(Picard and T'Pel enter) 
DATA: Sir, we have reached the designated coordinates. 
PICARD: Hold this position. Long range scan. 
DATA: Captain, I am detecting a ship in the Neutral Zone.
Configuration, Romulan warbird. 
PICARD: Yellow alert. Hail the Warbird, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. They are responding. Text only. We are to proceed to
the agreed coordinates. 
PICARD: Set course zero three seven mark zero zero five, warp four.
Take us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign. 
(a little later) 
WORF: Captain, the warbird is holding position. In three minutes we
will be within phaser range. 
PICARD: Red alert. I trust my crew, Ambassador. They will take no
provocative action unless I order them. 
T'PEL: Hold position on these coordinates. 
RIKER: Slow to half impulse. 
T'PEL: Open a channel. 
WORF: Open. 
T'PEL: I am Ambassador T'Pel. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: I am Admiral Mendak. 
T'PEL: There is no established protocol for a meeting of this nature.
The logical course is that I transport aboard your ship and begin the
negotiations. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: Yes. Captain, I note your defensive systems
have been activated. 
PICARD: As have yours. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: It was not meant as an accusation Indeed, I
salute your show of strength. Ambassador, we are honoured by your
presence. You may transport aboard at your convenience. 
T'PEL: The honour is mine. 
(transmission ends) 
T'PEL: Have your Transporter room stand by. I will beam to their ship
with no further delay. 
PICARD: Ambassador, I urge you once more to reconsider. The Enterprise
can accommodate a Romulan delegation without sacrificing our security
or 
T'PEL: Captain Picard, I find your argument illogical. Please carry out
my instructions. 
PICARD: Picard to Chief O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien here. 
PICARD: Prepare to transport Ambassador T'Pel to the Romulan ship. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a lock on her signal once she's aboard.
At the first sign of trouble I want to be able to bring her back. 
WORF: Understood. Transporter activated. Captain! 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Transporter emergency! I'm losing her signal! 
WORF: Boosting power to autosequencers. 
DATA: Engaging computer override. 
RIKER: O'Brien, what happened down there? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: I'm losing the pattern. Trying to re establish. I'm
sorry, sir. I wasn't able to retrieve the signal. The Ambassador's
dead.

Second officer's personal log, supplemental. The
risks aboard a starship are accepted by all who serve, but I have never
failed to observe a deep emotional response to the loss of a comrade.
It is at times like this that I greatly miss the ability to share human
feelings.
