SILVA LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, the Raman is descending toward the
planet. 
RIKER: Geordi. 
[Laboratory]

DATA: We are at ninety percent of tolerance. My
calculations show you will reach one hundred percent of tolerance
before you are in range of the Hera. 
LAFORGE: Then we're going to have to go beyond tolerance. 
DATA: That would not be advisable. You must cease your descent.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

SILVA: No, Geordi, don't, please. 
LAFORGE: Data, I'm taking this ship down. Now, if you don't boost the
gain past tolerance levels, I'll lose the interface when we go out of
range and my system will go into shock.

[Laboratory]

DATA: Geordi, you are putting me in a difficult
position. Please, cease your descent. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I won't do it, Data. You're going to have
to increase the tolerance. 
[Laboratory]

DATA: Disengaging safety systems. Going to full
tolerance levels, now. 
LAFORGE: Thank you, Data.

[Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: We're getting close. 
SILVA: Thank God. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain?
