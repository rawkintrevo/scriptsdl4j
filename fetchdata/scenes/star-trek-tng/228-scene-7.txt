RIKER CRUSHER OBRIEN LAFORGE BARCLAY

[USS Yosemite]

(just down the corridor) 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Joshua Kelly. He was the ship's engineer. 
RIKER: How did he die? 
CRUSHER: He has second and third degree burns over most of his body,
but I don't think they were the cause of his death. I'm like to take
him back to do an autopsy.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: You're sure about this, sir? 
BARCLAY: Sure. Please proceed. 
O'BRIEN: It'll only take a minute. It should be a smooth ride over. 
BARCLAY: Good. Good. 
O'BRIEN: I know how you feel about this, sir. 
BARCLAY: You're afraid of transporting, too? 
O'BRIEN: No. Arachnids. Sickening, crawly little things, don't you
think? All those legs. 
BARCLAY: Spiders? They've never bothered me. 
O'BRIEN: A few years back, I was called in to re-route an emitter array
at a Starbase on Zayra Four. Turns out the entire system was infested
with Talarian hook spiders. You ever seen a Talarian hook spider? Their
legs are half a metre long. Well, I had a choice. Do I walk away and
let the emitter blow itself to hell, or do I crawl in the Jeffries tube
with twenty hook spiders? 
BARCLAY: What happened? 
O'BRIEN: It was the hardest thing I ever did, but I got through it.
After that, I was never quite as afraid of spiders. 
BARCLAY: Thanks. 
O'BRIEN: Energising.

[USS Yosemite Bridge]

LAFORGE: Reg. Welcome aboard. You ready to work? 
BARCLAY: Yes, sir. 
LAFORGE: Good. Why don't you start by downloading the ship's science
logs over there. 
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Still four members of the crew unaccounted for. Did you come up
with anything? 
LAFORGE: I don't know how these fit in, but I found them all around the
transporter platform. 
RIKER: What are they? 
LAFORGE: They look like pieces of a standard sample container. 
RIKER: Take them back to the ship, analyze them there. Mister Barclay.
Glad you could join us. 
BARCLAY: Me too, sir.
