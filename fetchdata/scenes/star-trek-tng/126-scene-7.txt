[Bridge]

TROI: As you know, there is very little available
on the Romulans. 
PICARD: Counsellor, anything would be helpful. 
TROI: They seem to be creatures of extremes. One moment violent beyond
description, the next tender. They are related to the Vulcans, but as
each race developed, their differences grew wider. They are intensely
curious. Their belief in their own superiority is beyond arrogance. For
some reason they have exhibited a fascination with humans and it is
that fascination, more than anything else, that has kept the peace. One
other thing. They will not initiate anything. They will wait for you to
commit yourself. 
PICARD: Counter-punchers. Thank you, Counsellor. That's quite valuable.

[Guest lounge]

(Data and Sonny are at the food dispenser) 
DATA: Talk. 
GUEST3: I'd like me a thick Kansas City steak, and some country fried
potatoes, and a mess of greens. Oh, hell, just forget all that and give
me have a martini, straight up, with two olives. For the vitamins. 
(The glass appears out of thin air. Sonny samples it and whistles) 
DATA: Is there something wrong? 
GUEST3: Wrong? Only that your computer here fixed about the best martini
I have ever had. I just might get to like this place. Let's see if the
Braves are on. How do you turn on this teevee? 
RIKER: TV? 
GUEST3: Yeah, the boob tube. I'd like to see how the Braves are doing
after all this time. Probably still finding ways to lose. 
DATA: I believe he means television, sir. That particular form of
entertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty. 
GUEST3: Well, what do you guys do? I mean, you don't drink, and you
ain't got no TV. Must be kind of boring, ain't it? 
PICARD [OC]: Number One. 
RIKER: Riker here. 
PICARD: Would you and Mister Data report to the Bridge? 
RIKER: At once, sir. 
GUEST1: With whom were you speaking? 
RIKER: The Captain. 
GUEST1: Good. Would you tell him I would like to see him as soon as it's
convenient? 
GUEST0: What's going to happen to us? Do we stay here with you? Do we go
back to Earth? 
RIKER: That will all be up to the Captain. 
GUEST1: Well, get him in here. I have to phone Geneva right away about
my accounts. The interest alone could be enough to buy this ship. 
GUEST3: The Yankee's right. Let's get the big boy in here. 
RIKER: I'll pass along your request. If you'll excuse us. 
GUEST3: Duty calls. Hey, I understand. (to Data) Why don't you come back
later on. You and me'll find us a couple of low mileage pit woofies,
and help'em build a memory.
