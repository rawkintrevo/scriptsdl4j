WORF [OC]: Remain where you are and stay calm.
Bridge out. 
KRISTIN: Well, that helps a lot. 
CRUSHER: Report on our status? I wonder if every one else is in the
same condition as we are. 
KRISTIN: This hurts. 
(Crusher treats her arm) 
CRUSHER: How's that? 
KRISTIN: Thanks. 
CRUSHER: I didn't even think. I just picked it up and knew how to use
it. At least I have an idea of what I'm doing here. 
KRISTIN: But what about me? I mean, I'm a patient in a bathing suit.
That doesn't say much. 
CRUSHER: No, it doesn't. 
KRISTIN: Do you have any clothes around here I could borrow? At least
until I figure out where the swimming pool is?

(everyone is working at the rear stations except
Worf, who is in the Captain's chair) 
MACDUFF: We've heard from all decks. There are over a thousand people
on board. Everyone's had their memories affected in the same way we
have. 
WORF: I have completed a survey of our tactical systems. We are
equipped with ten phaser banks, two hundred and fifty photon torpedoes,
and a high capacity shield grid. 
MACDUFF: We're a battleship. 
WORF: It appears so. 
RO: This turbolift system gives us access to the rest of the ship. 
RIKER: That sounds like the next logical step. Start with the most
crucial areas. 
RO: Main Engineering, deck thirty six. I'm on my way. 
RIKER: Whoa, wait a minute. We've got to coordinate our efforts here
first. 
RO: I just need to do something. 
RIKER: Look, I feel the same way. We all do. But if anything's going to
get done. 
RO: I know, I just. It's really an ugly feeling I don't like being so
out of control. 
RIKER: Well, we're going to have to depend on each other if we're going
to get through this, okay? 
RO: Okay. 
RIKER: We're going to search the ship. 
WORF: Very well. Proceed. 
LAFORGE: I'll go with you. I want to get my hands on the computer core.
See if we can re-establish control from there.
