DATA LAFORGE

[Corridor]

DATA: It is perplexing to me that the Ullians'
ability to retrieve memory is so highly prized. If an event were
important enough to be recovered, why would it have been forgotten? 
LAFORGE: It's not quite the same for us as it is for you, Data. You
record every second of every moment of your life. 
DATA: That is correct. 
LAFORGE: And then if you want to recall any one of those moments, you
just access the proper memory circuit. 
DATA: My understanding of the human brain suggests that the process is
the same for you. Each memory is encoded in chains of molecules. If you
want to retrieve it, you simply access the proper RNA sequence. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's true. 
DATA: Then in what way is it different? 
LAFORGE: Sometimes there are memories we just can't access at the spur
of the moment. For instance, I have no recollection of how I spent my
last birthday. Birthdays are important occasions, and you would think
that I'd remember how I spent the day, but right now I can't even
remember where I was.
