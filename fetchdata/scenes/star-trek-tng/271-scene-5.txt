TROI WORF WAITRESS
double bed admit sleep designed forward ship order supposed

[Ten Forward]

(Worf is wolfing down food) 
TROI: Thanks for waiting. 
WORF: Do not approach me unannounced, especially when I'm eating. 
TROI: Worf we were supposed to have lunch together, remember? 
WORF: I was hungry. 
TROI: Well, I'm hungry too. Excuse me. 
WAITRESS: Yes? 
TROI: Can I have an order of Ongilin caviar. Make that a double order. 
WAITRESS: Certainly. 
WORF: Caviar? For lunch? 
TROI: I'm in the mood for something salty. Besides, it's no stranger
than what you're eating. (downs a glass of water) Have you noticed how
dry the air is on the ship? I wonder if the environmental controls are
set properly. 
(Worf belches) 
TROI: You're excused. 
(Troi's caviar arrives) 
TROI: Is something wrong? 
WORF: It has been a difficult day. The torpedo guidance system failed.
It was my fault. 
TROI: You always say that. 
WORF: It was my fault! I designed that guidance system. 
TROI: Worf, calm down. I think you're under more stress than you'd like
to admit. Maybe you should get some rest. 
WORF: Perhaps you are right. If you will excuse me. 
TROI: I didn't mean right now. (and has another glass of water)

[Worf's quarters]

(Worf can't sleep. He rips his sheet, prowls the
room semi-crouched then guts the bed for material to make a nest on the
floor. Now he can sleep)
