REPULSE RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY COMPUTER

  [Bridge]

COMPUTER: Repulse shuttle has cleared docking bay
three. 
RIKER: (sporting a very Naval beard) Open hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies opened. 
RIKER: Repulse, this is the Enterprise. We are getting underway. 
REPULSE [OC]: Acknowledged, Enterprise. Transfer complete. Good luck on
your mission. 
RIKER: And to you. 
REPULSE [OC]: Give my regards to your Captain. Repulse out. 
WESLEY: (in new uniform) Shuttlebay is secure, sir. 
RIKER: Thank you, Mister Crusher. Make all preparations to get
underway.

(Picard is looking at a transparent hexagonal
container) 
LAFORGE: We're constructing the enclosure on cargo deck five. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: The transfer's been complete. Doctor Pulaski is being shown to
her quarters. We're ready to get underway. 
PICARD: (back to his Yorkshire roots) Grand. Take a look at the
containment module our Chief Engineer has designed. 
RIKER: Chief Engineer. It still has a nice ring to it. 
LAFORGE: Each of these units will have total environmental control.
Gravity, temperature, atmosphere, light, all in a protective stasis
field. 
RIKER: And these get put into the large containment unit. 
LAFORGE: Right. See, these modules will keep the specimens alive, but
it's this large containment area that's going to keep us alive. Now, I
have to go and replicate this five hundred and twelve times, which
means I'll have to divert power from the warp engines to the replicator
for a while. 
PICARD: How long will we be on impulse power? 
LAFORGE: A couple of hours. Can't be helped. 
RIKER: When we leave 'audet Nine, I'm going to need all the power you
can slam into those warp engines.
LAFORGE: You'll have it. 
PICARD: I'll relieve you at zero three zero zero.
