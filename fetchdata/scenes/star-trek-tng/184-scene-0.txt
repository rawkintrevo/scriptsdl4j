TROI BROOKS

  [Troi's
office]

BROOKS: It's been five months since Marc's
accident. I haven't missed a single hour of my duties. I volunteered
for extra time in the nursery. My language studies are better than
they've ever been. Somebody else might have given in, but I didn't. 
TROI: Given in to what? 
BROOKS: Death is a normal part of life. Maybe some of us are better at
facing that than others. 
TROI: Maybe some of us aren't facing it at all. 
BROOKS: What do you mean? 
TROI: Recovery from a great loss involves a great deal of pain. If we
try to avoid that pain, we can make it harder on ourselves in the long
run. 
BROOKS: But I feel fine. 
TROI: Today would have been your husband's thirty eighth birthday. 
BROOKS: You keep excellent records, Deanna. Last night. I dreamt Marc
was with me, celebrating. I was so glad that this nonsense was finally
over. Then I woke up. Alone. And I knew that he was dead. For the first
time, I knew it. I looked around for anything that belonged to him.
Anything. I forgot that after the funeral I told them to take it all
away. What in the world was I thinking? 
(Troi gets a wooden box from a cupboard) 
TROI: They didn't take everything away. 
(Brooks opens the box and it plays a tune) 
BROOKS: How did you know? (and bursts into tears)
