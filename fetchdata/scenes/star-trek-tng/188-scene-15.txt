[Bridge]

PICARD: What do you have, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Visuals available now, Captain. 
RIKER: M-class. Nickel-iron core, nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. 
PICARD: The same planet our sensors picked up before the so-called
wormhole. 
RIKER: Affirmative. 
LAFORGE: No indication of any space-time distortion whatsoever. The
probe should at least be detecting some residual effect, even if the
wormhole is inactive. 
PICARD: That's because there is no a wormhole. There never was. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: It was a ruse, designed to throw us off the track. Look at the
clues. Doctor Crusher's incubation experiment, the computer clock, the
transporter trace. All indicate the existence of a missing day.
Lieutenant Worf's broken wrist would seem to suggest that we were awake
and aware for that day, possibly in a struggle for our lives. 
CRUSHER: The fact that we're still alive suggests we might have won. 
PICARD: Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's behaviour would seem to suggest
we did not. Why else would he be willing to sacrifice his career rather
than tell the truth? 
WORF: If we didn't win and we didn't lose? 
PICARD: Then the only alternative would be a stalemate. Maybe a
compromise might have been reached, a compromise that forced Data into
this silence. 
RIKER: Maybe by uncovering all this, we run the risk of upsetting the
stalemate. Maybe we should leave well enough alone. 
PICARD: Possibly, Number One, and I would be prepared to live with the
mystery, but Data's role in this must be ascertained or he'll never be
trusted with starship duty again. Ensign, take us back to the scene of
the crime. The T-tauri system, warp two. 
(whoosh) 
MCKNIGHT: Within sensor range, Captain. 
PICARD: Drop to impulse, Ensign. Mister Worf, maximum shields. Ready
all weapons. 
WORF: Shields up. Photon torpedoes armed. Phasers standing by. Captain,
an energy field has appeared between our position and the planet. 
PICARD: On screen. (it's green) Hold position. Let's see what it does. 
WORF: The field has emitted an energy pulse. Approaching the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: Too slow to be a photon torpedo. 
WORF: It might be a probe. 
PICARD: Let's see what happens when it hits the shields. 
WORF: Shields undamaged. The energy pulse has dispersed. 
(Troi is asleep when the green pulse takes her over)
