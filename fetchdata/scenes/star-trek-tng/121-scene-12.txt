LAFORGE: Prepare to initiate separation sequence. 
T'SU: All decks report ready.

(The saucer rises away)

eight, initiate. Static charge compensate.

five.

[Cavern]

(Picard and Crusher are far enough apart to be out
of sight of each other, but not earshot) 
PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: No exits? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
CRUSHER: If you find one, go. 
PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. I need to sleep. Woke up too early. 
PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about those
roots. How did you know their medicinal values? 
CRUSHER: My grandmother. 
PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? 
CRUSHER: No. 
PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? 
CRUSHER: No. She helped to colonise Arveda Three. 
PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use
what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then
taught it to me. 
PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But then
there must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. 
CRUSHER: Quite a few. 
PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt.
It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. 
(He presses a button and the whole wall lights up) 
PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. 
CRUSHER: Tracking what? 
PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. 
GUEST0: Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. 
CRUSHER: Who's that? 
PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the
Enterprise. What unit? 
GUEST0: Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement.
The ultimate in weapons system technology. 
PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? 
GUEST0: Impressive demonstration, isn't it? 
PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. 
GUEST0: Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does
it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground
personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. 
PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. 
GUEST0: Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and
all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery,
whatever you need. 
CRUSHER: It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. 
GUEST0: The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic,
adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. 
PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are the
people of Minos? 
GUEST0: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing
system.
PICARD: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you.
What was that noise? 
GUEST0: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new,
stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon
against the targets on the surface. 
PICARD: Abort it! 
GUEST0: Why would I want to do that? It can't demonstrate its
abilities unless we let it leave the nest.
