RIKER: The ship is using a modified tractor beam to
collect vertion particles from the star. 
PICARD: Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship was
looking for.

RIKER: The particles are being routed through the transporter system
into cargo bay five. 
PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? 
LAFORGE [OC]: The object is absorbing

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Vertion particles. It's growing even
faster than before. Commander, I'm picking up internal energy this

[Bridge]

RIKER: What do you mean? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I mean it's generating its own energy. I'm picking up
coherent emissions 
[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Matter conversion. It's incredible. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute, something's wrong. We've got power fluctuations.
Vertion absorption rate is dropping. What's happening to the particle
beam? 
[Bridge]

RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particles
in the star. There's nothing left to take out. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain

LAFORGE: The energy output of the object is
decreasing.

and the object stops glowing)
