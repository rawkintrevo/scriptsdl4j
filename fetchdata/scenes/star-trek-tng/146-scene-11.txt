TROI WORF PICARD RIKER KEHLEYR DATA

[Observation Lounge]

RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant 
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? 
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. 
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. 
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. 
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. 
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. 
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. 
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? 
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. 
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. 
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? 
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. 
TROI: Why too late? 
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. 
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.

K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. 
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? 
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. 
PICARD: No. 
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. 
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. 
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. 
K'EHLEYR: Captain. 
(All leave except Picard and Worf) 
PICARD: Lieutenant? 
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? 
WORF: Yes. 
PICARD: Any professional reasons? 
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. 
PICARD: Good.

[Corridor]

TROI: I didn't know it was possible for a human and
a Klingon to produce a child. 
K'EHLEYR: Actually, the DNA is compatible, with a fair amount of help.
Rather like my parents. 
TROI: I know exactly what you mean. My father was human and my mother
is a Betazoid. 
K'EHLEYR: Really? It was the other way around for me. My mother was
human. You must've grown up like I did, trapped between cultures. 
TROI: I never felt trapped. I tried to experience the richness and
diversity of the two worlds. 
K'EHLEYR: Perhaps you got the best of each.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Myself, I think I got the worst of each. 
TROI: Oh, I doubt that. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense of humour is bad enough.
It's gotten me into plenty of trouble. 
TROI: And your Klingon side? 
K'EHLEYR: That, I keep under tight control. It's like a terrible
temper. It's not something I want people to see. 
TROI: Everyone has tempers. 
K'EHLEYR: Not like mine. Sometimes I feel there's a monster inside of
me, fighting to get out. 
TROI: And it frightens you. 
K'EHLEYR: Of course it does. My Klingon side can be terrifying, even to
me. 
TROI: It gives you strength. It's a part of you. 
K'EHLEYR: That doesn't mean I have to like it.

[Tactical room]

((K'Ehleyr has changed into a red leather catsuit) 
WORF: You are late. 
K'EHLEYR: Sorry. Had to make myself beautiful. 
WORF: I fail to understand why. 
K'EHLEYR: Worf, we're alone now. You don't have to act like a Klingon
glacier. I don't bite. Well, that's wrong, I do bite. 
WORF: Shall we proceed with our assigned duties? 
K'EHLEYR: You weren't this aloof six years ago. Or don't you remember? 
WORF: There is nothing wrong with my memory. 
K'EHLEYR: Well there's something wrong with the rest of you. You're not
even looking at me. 
WORF: I am familiar with your appearance. 
K'EHLEYR: And it gives you no pleasure to see me again. It isn't as if
we tried it and it didn't work, you know. You never gave it a chance. 
WORF: I never? 
K'EHLEYR: I mean, as I see it, we have some unfinished business, you
and I. 
WORF: Not as far as I'm concerned. According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc. But there is nothing regarding the
ship's mission. 
K'EHLEYR: Probably some secret military objective. 
WORF: Perhaps, but we have no evidence of that. 
K'EHLEYR: Why else would there be no record of the mission? 
WORF: The records may simply have been lost. 
K'EHLEYR: What does it matter? Our concern is the present, the possible
threat. 
WORF: And to contend with that threat, we need information. 
K'EHLEYR: We have all the information we need. 
WORF: That is foolish. Knowing their mission might help us understand
them. 
K'EHLEYR: There is nothing to understand. These are Klingons. They'll
attack. In their minds, we're the enemy, and there's no way we're going
to talk them out of that! 
WORF: And I do not appreciate being interrupted. 
K'EHLEYR: And I do not appreciate wasting my time. 
WORF: We were instructed to come up with options. 
K'EHLEYR: There aren't any. The assignment's hopeless. 
WORF: There are always options. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh, are there? Tell me, whatever happened to that wonderful
Klingon fatalism of yours? 
WORF: My experiences aboard this ship have taught me that most problems
have more than one solution. 
K'EHLEYR: Starfleet hasn't improved you one bit. You're as stubborn as
ever. 
WORF: Are you going to carry out your duties, or aren't you? 
K'EHLEYR: All right, I will. Upon due consideration of the problem and
careful examination of all possible options, my original recommendation
stands. Meeting adjourned.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(She takes out her pent up rage on the poor
defenceless glass table. Then the doorbell rings) 
K'EHLEYR: Come. 
(Troi enters, carefully) 
TROI: You're upset. 
K'EHLEYR: Your finely-honed Betazoid sense tells you that? 
TROI: Well, that and the table. 
K'EHLEYR: I warned you about my Klingon half. 
TROI: May I make a suggestion? 
K'EHLEYR: I thank you, Counsellor. But I don't want any counseling. 
TROI: Actually, I was going to suggest something else. 
K'EHLEYR: Oh? 
TROI: I find the exercise programs on the holodeck rigorous enough to
put my mind off most frustrations. 
K'EHLEYR: And it'll keep me from wrecking the ship. 
TROI: That, too
