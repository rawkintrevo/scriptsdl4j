DATA: I've traced it through our sensor channel,
sir It is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction. 
LAFORGE: Confirmed by my readings, Captain. It's a shadow something. 
DATA: Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. 
PICARD: What is, Commander? 
DATA: Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm
relays, sir. 
PICARD: Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander. 
DATA: Enterprise to object off our starboard bow. Request that you
identify yourself. 
(And something appears) 
LAFORGE: Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser banks ready. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. Any reply? 
DATA: It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now running it through
language and logic circuits. 
PICARD: Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Sir. 
PICARD: Have a real look. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
OFFICER: (At Tasha's station) Sir, my sensors read it. Well, it's half

PICARD: Data, what the hell is it?
