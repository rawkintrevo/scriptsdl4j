WESLEY: Commander Data, I'm picking up an unusual
echo from my navigational sensors. 
WORF: Something is out there, sir, tracking us, matching our speed and
heading. Something which does not fully register on our instruments. 
DATA: Since there is no known natural phenomenon capable of travel at
warp velocities, there are but two possibilities. Either it is a sensor
malfunction, another ship is following us covertly. 
WORF: It is not a sensor malfunction. 
DATA: Agreed. 
WESLEY: But Commander, if it is a Romulan ship, with their cloaking
device we shouldn't pick them up at all. 
LAFORGE: Unless they're pulling so much power for something else that
they can't fully cloak. 
WESLEY: Like what? 
LAFORGE: Ask the Romulans. If it is the Romulans. 
DATA: Lieutenant, continue monitoring the precise position of the echo.
Any sudden change in its behaviour, initiate Yellow Alert. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Tam's quarters]

TAM: Come in. 
(Deanna enters) 
TAM: How're things in the land of the living? 
TROI: I thought you might be lonely. No one sees you except Data. 
TAM: Lonely? I can hear everything that everyone on this ship thinks.
No one besides you seems to be missing my charming 
TROI: You want them to dislike you. Why? 
TAM: Because I'm not a nice man. Okay, okay. Because they scare me.
They're too many minds. I can't shut them out. I never could learn. All
their loves, their hates, their fears, their needs. It's like a tide
that never ebbs. I could drown. 
TROI: I remember. 
TAM: You understood, at least a little, how I felt. I see you finally
found a place to fit in. People to care about. 
TROI: And you're still looking. 
TAM: Then there's Ghorusda. I've got enough doubt in my reliability
without having to listen to Riker's and Picard's 
TROI: What happened there? 
TAM: I thought everyone knew. 
TROI: No. What happened to you? 
TAM: Maybe I got too involved with the Ghorusdans, with their point of
view. It happens to me. I wanted everyone to get along. I could have
warned Darson more forcefully. 
TROI: So, after that you ran away? The last I heard, you were the only
Federation delegate assigned to Chandra Five. 
TAM: Beautiful creatures, the Chandrans. Their minds are glacial. They
have a lovely three day ritual for saying hello. Peaceful, untroubled
people. 
TROI: Unlike humanoids? 
TAM: Well, except for your friend Data. I like him. He's restful. 
TROI: I believe your impression of Data is probably unique. 
TAM: Yeah? Well, having to get to know someone, just once, has its
appeal. I mean, talking to them, instead of getting it all at once up
here whether I want it or not. 
TROI: But you accepted this mission. You could have stayed on Chandra
Five. You willingly came aboard a ship with over a thousand people. 
TAM: How could I not? Think of it, Dee. This intelligence that swims
naked through space like a fish in the sea. Totally alien, mysterious,
not like us at all. Ancient. And alone. So lonely, for so long. 
TROI: How can you know that? Tam? You're in contact with it. With Tin
Man. Aren't you? 
TAM: No. Well, yes, a little. But not quite on a conscious level. 
TROI: We're light years away. That's impossible, even for you. 
TAM: Impossible for me. Maybe not impossible for Tin Man.
