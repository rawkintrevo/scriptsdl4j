O'BRIEN [OC]: Some kind of force field went up. 
WORF: Confirmed. The alien has thrown up a shield. It is blocking all
our sensors. Captain, the Romulans' weapons systems are now at full
power. 
PICARD: Follow them in, Mister Crusher. Red Alert. Mister Worf, arm
photon torpedoes.
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Gomtuu corridor]

(Tam's hand sinks into the organic wall) 
TAM: Yes. 
(But for Data it is a solid surface) 
DATA: There is a large chamber twenty metres ahead. 
TAM: I know. I know everything now. Come on. 
(further on, a door opens for them)

[Pilot chamber]

(it seems empty) 
DATA: Intriguing. 
TAM: This is the control centre, where Gomtuu's crew guided their
journeys. The ship and the crew existed symbiotically. They needed one
another. When Gomtuu had no one left to care for, it no longer had a
reason to exist. 
DATA: Is that the purpose of existence? To care for someone? 
TAM: It is for me. Deanna was right. I'll lose myself here. 
(a chair grows up out of the floor) 
DATA: I must remind you that our objective is to bring Tin Man out of
danger and report our findings to Starfleet. 
TAM: I'm not going back, Data. I'm staying here.

WORF: Sir, the Romulans are hailing us. 
ROMULAN [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, if you interfere with us, we
will fire upon you as well. 
PICARD: Commander, we are prepared to defend the life of the alien.
Screen off. Shields up. 
WORF: Power levels aboard the alien are increasing, sir. 
WESLEY: Captain, the diameter of the star has decreased by one hundred
thousand kilometres. 
PICARD: It's beginning.
