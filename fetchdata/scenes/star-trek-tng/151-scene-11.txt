LAFORGE: I'll get you to nine point three seven in
fifteen seconds. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: Warp eight point five. Warp nine. The
warship continues to match our acceleration curve perfectly. 
PICARD: Number One, I have the distinct impression that we're being
toyed with. Take us back to Rana Four. 
RIKER: Back? 
PICARD: We have unfinished business there. I need to have a talk with
those two people. You have the Bridge. 
RIKER: Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. This one's
getting away.

PICARD: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm Jean-Luc
Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something you
will need if you're going to stay on Rana Four. It's a matter
replicator. It has limited capabilities, but 
KEVIN: Thank you, but we have no use for such a thing. 
PICARD: It will provide you with clothing, food and clean water.
Lieutenant Worf demonstrate its operation. 
KEVIN: We don't need it. 
RISHON: Kevin, you know we do. Thank you, Captain. Kevin and I were
about to have afternoon tea. You and Mister Worf must join us. 
PICARD: I'd like that very much. 
KEVIN: Rishon, they only want to spy on us like this morning. 
RISHON: Kevin Uxbridge, I have never turned anyone away from this
house, and I'm not going to start now. Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you.
