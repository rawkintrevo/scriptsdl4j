RIKER: You pull as many people off the surface as
you can and get back to the transwarp conduit. The Captain's orders
were to get the Enterprise back to Federation space. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: Acknowledged. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker out. 
CRUSHER: Prepare to leave orbit. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg ship is powering up its forward weapons array.
They'll be in firing range in, in twenty seconds. 
CRUSHER: Salazar, how many people do we still have down there? 
SALAZAR [OC]: Seventy three, sir. 
CRUSHER: Put the Borg ship onscreen. 
TAITT: Should I raise shields, sir? 
CRUSHER: Not yet. I want to keep bringing people up until the last
possible second. 
TAITT: Ten seconds. 
CRUSHER: Stand by to raise shields and break orbit on my mark. 
TAITT: Five seconds. 
CRUSHER: Mark. 
(an energy bolt hits) 
TAITT: Shields down to seventy percent. 
CRUSHER: Establish a frequency shift firing pattern and return fire. 
TAITT: Er, right. 
(two torpedoes are fired) 
TAITT: Direct hit, no damage. 
CRUSHER: Helm, set course for the conduit, maximum warp. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg aren't following us. 
CRUSHER: Salazar 
[Transporter room]

CRUSHER [OC]: How many people did we leave behind? 
SALAZAR: Forty seven, sir.

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: Another minute and we would have had them.

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Riker to any team leader. 
POWELL [OC]: Lieutenant Powell here, sir. 
RIKER: Round up everybody who was left behind. Take cover. Try to avoid
any contact with the Borg. 
POWELL [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Riker out. Even if Beverly can get back to Federation space,
it'll be a few days before Starfleet can get any ships here. Until
then, we're on our own.

PICARD: Data, you must realise that something has
happened to you. The Data I know would never have agreed to be a
willing party to Lore's plan. 
DATA: (taking the comm. badges) I now realise that my life aboard the
Enterprise was a waste. My quest to become human was misguided. An
evolutionary step in the wrong direction. 
TROI: Data, all I'm sensing from you is anger and hatred. Have you felt
any other emotions? 
DATA: There are no other emotions. 
LAFORGE: Data, just because you haven't experienced certain emotions
doesn't mean they don't exist. Lore is only feeding you the negative
ones. 
DATA: Counsellor Troi told me herself that feelings are not negative or
positive. It is how we act on them that makes them good or bad. 
PICARD: Fine. But what about the things that Lore is proposing? What
about the lives that have already been lost? 
DATA: You simply do not understand. In a quest such as ours, sacrifices
have to be made. It is regrettable, but the greater good must be
served. Give me your visor. 
LAFORGE: Why? 
DATA: Give it to me or I will take it by force. 
(Geordi takes it off) 
DATA: I am not your puppet anymore. 
(he turns on the forcefield and walks away)
