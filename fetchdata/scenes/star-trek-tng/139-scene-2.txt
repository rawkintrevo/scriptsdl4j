PICARD RIKER DATA WORF

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, we've picked up an automated
signal from a Federation shuttlecraft. 
RIKER: A shuttlecraft? How's that possible? I thought we were the only
manned Federation vessel out here. 
PICARD: Apparently not. 
RIKER: What's a shuttlecraft doing out this far? Where's its mother
ship? 
WORF: Sensors indicate there is at least one life form on board the
shuttle, sir. Humanoid. 
PICARD: Perhaps someone to answer your questions, Number One. Open
hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Communication is not possible, sir. The shuttle is without power.

RIKER: Set course to intercept. 
DATA: Estimate intercept in three minutes.

Captain's log, stardate 42679.2. While en route to
the Endicor system, we have encountered a Federation shuttlecraft,
which seems to have appeared out of nowhere. There are no indications
of where it came from or how it got out here.

WORF: We are closing on shuttlecraft, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. On screen. 
RIKER: Magnify. 
(Definitely a tiny Federation shuttlecraft, tumbling gently in space) 
RIKER: Prepare to lock on tractor beam. 
DATA: Target vehicle. We will be within tractor beam range in two
seconds. 
RIKER: Set automatic locking device. Alert Shuttlebay two.
