RIKER [OC]: Notify the transporter room I have fourteen to beam up. 
CRUSHER: I can't allow it.

here. Until I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I can't let anyone
new be exposed. 
RIKER: Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down here.

here. Until I have a better idea of what I'm dealing with, no one can
beam up. I'm sorry, Will, but you must wait.

any effect on Mister Data?

reach the Neutral Zone before it is too late.

computed the length of time the border outpost

DATA: And the USS Berlin can safely withstand a
Romulan attack, and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp
speed. That leaves Doctor Crusher forty eight minutes to develop an

something. 
RIKER: Forty-eight minutes.
