RIKER SAVAR PICARD REMMICK AARON QUINN

[Transporter room]

PICARD: It's not Gregory Quinn. It may look like
him and sound like him, but it isn't him. 
RIKER: Are you absolutely certain, Captain? 
PICARD: I'm certain, Number One. I want you to stay close. Keep your
eye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving him
a full medical examination. 
RIKER: How? 
PICARD: I don't know, just do it. 
RIKER: He's a senior Admiral. 
PICARD: It's not him, Will. I know that now. What I have to find out is
how this happened, and who or what is behind it. 
RIKER: Captain, if you're right. 
PICARD: I'm right. 
RIKER: Should you be beaming down there alone, unarmed? 
PICARD: I'll take care. Find out what you can, then join me, in force
if necessary. Energise. 
RIKER: Good luck, sir.

[Starfleet Reception area]

SAVAR: Welcome home, Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Thank you, sir. My first officer will be joining us shortly. 
SAVAR: Yes, I'm sure he will. 
AARON: You've met Commander Remmick, haven't you? 
REMMICK: Under less than ideal circumstances. It's nice to see you
again, Captain. 
SAVAR: We've prepared a special meal in your honour. 
PICARD: Delightful. Tell me, why is the corridor so quiet? The last
time I was here, it was bustling with activity. 
REMMICK: It usually is. Tonight's a quiet night. 
SAVAR: Yes, a quiet night. 
[Guest quarters]

RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? 
QUINN: Quite ready, Commander. 
RIKER: What's in the case? 
QUINN: Actually, I brought it for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you would
like you to see it first? 
RIKER: What is it? 
QUINN: A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team
on an uncharted planet. 
RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? 
QUINN: Oh, you'll be hearing about it shortly, but first there remains
much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of
life. 
RIKER: Superior? 
QUINN: Totally. Come, have a look. 
RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. 
(Quinn grabs his arm with a surprising amount of strength) 
QUINN: It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins.
They do wonders for the body. 
(There's a very one-sided fight - Quinn easily throws Riker around the
room)
RIKER: Riker to Security. Guest quarters seventeen. Emergency. 
(Quinn knocks Riker out cold)
