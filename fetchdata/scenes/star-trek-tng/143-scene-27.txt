TROI WORF PICARD GREBNEDLOG PULASKI WESLEY RIKER DATA

[Bridge]

TROI: It's all deception. Nothing the Pakleds have
said or done has been sincere. 
DATA: Intensified scan shows their guidance system to be perfectly
intact, as is their power generator. 
RIKER: Then what was Geordi repairing? 
DATA: Apparently, the putative malfunctions were carefully programmed
into their ship's computer. 
RIKER: I didn't think the Pakleds had that kind of technology. 
DATA: They seem to have made some technological leaps forward,
Commander. 
RIKER: Why would they go through the charade of needing our help? 
TROI: For the sole purpose of making Lieutenant La Forge their
prisoner. 
Captain's personal log, stardate 42779.5. We have
arrived at Starbase Five One Five. I'm still quite uneasy, despite
assurances that this medical procedure poses little risk. 
[Starbase 515 Medical Complex]

PICARD: I hope you won't be late for your exams. 
WESLEY: I still have some time, sir. 
PICARD: Why do I get the distinct impression you're acting like some
kind of escort? 
WESLEY: Doctor Pulaski asked me to make sure you actually went inside. 
PICARD: That woman. She would. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: Yes, what is it, Ensign? 
WESLEY: I enjoyed our trip together, sir. 
PICARD: So did I.

DATA: They are initiating visual contact, sir. 
RIKER: Maybe now we'll find out what they really want. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Enterprise. 
RIKER: We demand that you return our crewmember immediately. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Request denied. 
RIKER: Lower your shield! 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Request denied. 
(and he shoots Geordi with the phaser, again) 
RIKER: Stop it! What do you want? 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: You think we are not smart. 
RIKER: I think you need to continue to develop. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We are smart. 
RIKER: Prove it. Return our man to us. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: You want him? 
RIKER: Yes, damn it. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Good. We want all computer information from
your ship. Now.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: We've got a man held hostage by alien forces
and all I have are no-option options. I need some input. 
PULASKI: Is Geordi all right? 
WORF: He's already been hit by multiple phaser stuns. 
PULASKI: He could need medical attention. 
WORF: Security team stands ready to take the initiative, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
DATA: Our options have not changed. We can either respond to the Pakled
demand or not. We can either use force or not. 
RIKER: Allowing them access to our computer is a complete breech of
Starfleet security. 
WORF: Then force it must be.
