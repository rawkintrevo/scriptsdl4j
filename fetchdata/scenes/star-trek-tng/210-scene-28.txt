[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We lost four warp transfer conduits,
Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: The wave is gaining on us. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: We need more speed. 
LAFORGE [OC]: I doubt that I can keep this speed up 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Much longer, Commander. You'd better fire
those torpedoes while we're still in front of the wave. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, how long before the wave
overtakes us? 
DATA: At our current speed, four minutes thirty seconds, sir. 
WORF: Captain, permission to leave the bridge. 
PICARD: Granted. Commander, will you accompany Mister Worf to biolab
four. 
DATA: Captain, biolab four is one of the areas that will be flooded
with ion radiation. 
PICARD: Commander. I can't let the soliton wave hit the colony. You
have three minutes, not one second more.

RIKER: Primary control's shorted out. 
(Worf rips a panel from the wall and rearranges chips)
WORF: Stand clear. 
(the door opens and flames burst out before being suppressed)

WORF: Alexander! 
RIKER: Alexander, can you hear me? Alexander?
