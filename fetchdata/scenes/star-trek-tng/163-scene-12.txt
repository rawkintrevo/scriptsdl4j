DATA: There is a high degree of probability that
the temporal rift is symmetrical, Captain. 
PICARD: Then what would happen if the Enterprise C were to fly back
through it? 
DATA: Back, sir? The Enterprise C would emerge in her own time period
at almost the same instant she left. 
PICARD: Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Is there any possibility she could survive?
DATA: None, sir. 
PICARD: Then sending them back would be a death sentence.

[Corridor]

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Lieutenant Barrett to
communications. 
TASHA: She was the first Galaxy Class warship built by the Federation.
Forty two decks. Capable of transporting over six thousand troops. 
CASTILLO: How long have you been on board? 
TASHA: Four years. Straight out of the Academy. I was lucky to get the
Enterprise. 
CASTILLO: Yeah, me too. I mean, my Enterprise.

[Sickbay]

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Triage team to main shuttlebay. 
GARRETT: Lieutenant, how's the ship? 
CASTILLO: We've restored minimal shields and the forward phaser banks.
Still no photon launchers or warp drive. 
GARRETT: Concentrate on the weapon systems. From what Captain Picard
told me, the Federation can use all the help it can get. 
TASHA: And soon. Our sensors have picked up Klingon warships in this
sector, Captain. 
GARRETT: Why wasn't I informed, Mister Castillo? 
CASTILLO: Captain, you shouldn't 
GARRETT: As senior officer, I want you to be my liaison to the
Enterprise-D. Coordinate with Tactical. 
TASHA: That's me, Captain. 
CRUSHER: Where do you think you're going? 
GARRETT: I'm resuming my duties, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Captain, you need at least another twenty four hours. 
GARRETT: Nonsense. Doctors always over-protect their patients. 
CRUSHER: And captains always push themselves too hard. 
GARRETT: Doctor, my ship and crew need me now. Twenty four hours might
as well be twenty four years.
