[Piano bar]

WORF: Do you know any Klingon opera?
AMARIE: I don't get a lot of requests for it.
WORF: Surely, you must know at least one theme from Aktuh and Maylota.
AMARIE: I may be a little rusty. 
(with a pounding discord, she starts to sing an aria, and Worf joins
in. A fat Ferengi enters with a tall thin female on each arm) 
OMAG: What is that dreadful noise? It sounds like a Bardakian pronghorn
moose. You know what I want to hear.
AMARIE: Yes, yes, I know. 
WORF: Worf to Enterprise. 
RIKER [OC]: Go ahead. 
WORF: A fat Ferengi 
[Bridge]


WORF [OC]: Has just entered the establishment.
RIKER: Is that Melor Famagal I hear?
WORF [OC]: It is.
RIKER: I'm on my way.

[Piano bar]

OMAG: Where's the waiter? Is there a waiter in this
sorry place?
RIKER: Is there a problem?
OMAG: Yes. I need more napkins.
RIKER: Use your sleeve.
OMAG: What did you say?
RIKER: Or use one of their sleeves, I don't care.
OMAG: Who are you?
RIKER: Commander William Riker, USS Enterprise.
OMAG: Am I supposed to stand up and salute?
RIKER: We're investigating the disappearance of a Vulcan ship. 
OMAG: Well you've got the wrong Ferengi. I never trade in Vulcan ships.

RIKER: We know that you're involved. 
OMAG: Who would want a Vulcan ship? Vulcans are pacifists. I deal in
warships. Can somebody get me a napkin?
RIKER: Who would want a Vulcan ship?
OMAG: Hypothetically speaking? 
RIKER: Hypothetically speaking.
OMAG: I never learned to speak hypothetical.
(so Riker tips Omag's dinner onto his lap then grabs him by his lapels)

OMAG: Are you crazy?
RIKER: Let me explain what'll happen to you if you don't tell me about
the Vulcan ship. Your right of passage
through this sector will be revoked and more than that, I will be very
unhappy.
OMAG: I delivered it to a Barolian freighter. 
RIKER: At what coordinates?
OMAG: I don't remember. Ow! Watch it! You're stretching my neck.
RIKER: Co-ordinates?
OMAG: At Galorndon Core. Near the Neutral Zone. That's all I know. I
swear it.
RIKER: Enjoy your dinner.
