[Ten Forward]

(Data and Guinan are looking at the nebula) 
GUINAN: It's a Samarian coral fish with its fin unfolded. 
DATA: I believe what you are seeing is the effect of the fluid dynamic
processes inherent in the large scale motion of highly rarified gas. 
GUINAN: No, no. First it was a fish, and now it's a Mintonian sailing
ship. 
DATA: Where? 
GUINAN: Right there. Don't you see the two swirls coming together to
form the mast? 
DATA: I do not see it. It is interesting that people try to find
meaningful patterns in things that are essentially
random. I have noticed that the images they perceive sometimes suggest
what they are thinking about at that particular moment. Besides, it is
clearly a bunny rabbit. 
(Clara enters) 
GUINAN: Looks as though someone's lost their way. Excuse me. Hello. Are
you looking for someone? 
CLARA: No. I brought Isabella to see Ten Forward. 
GUINAN: Oh, I see. Well, ordinarily we would only let you in with a
grown-up, but since you've brought Isabella, you can be my guest. Won't
you join me? 
CLARA: Thank you. 
GUINAN: Now, how about two Papalla juices with extra bubbles. 
CLARA: Just one, please. Isabella isn't thirsty. 
GUINAN: One juice. 
CLARA: You're not like the other grown-ups. 
GUINAN: Oh, no? 
CLARA: They don't think Isabella's real. 
GUINAN: Well, most grown-ups have a hard time with things they can't
see. 
CLARA: Why? 
GUINAN: Well, because they get preoccupied by other things. 
CLARA: Like what? 
GUINAN: Like how much fuel it takes to power a ship, or whether we
should go to one star system or another, or whether little girls should
go to bed at seven or be
allowed to stay up till eight. So their heads can get so full that they
forget about the things that are important to you and me, like
imaginary friends. 
CLARA: If the other grown-ups don't understand, how come you do? 
GUINAN: Maybe because when I was your age, I had one. 
CLARA: You did? What was she like? 
GUINAN: It wasn't a she. 
CLARA: What was he like? 
GUINAN: It wasn't a he. 
CLARA: It? 
GUINAN: It was a Tarkassian razor beast. It had dark brown fur and gold
eyes and huge spiny wings, and it would fly so fast nobody could see it
except me. 
CLARA: Sounds scary. 
GUINAN: Oh, it was, especially when he smiled. But the best thing about
him was I could curl up on his furry belly, and he had the softest purr
you ever heard. It put me right to sleep every night. I tell you, that
razorbeast was a good friend. 
CLARA: So is Isabella. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: Hello, Clara. 
CLARA: Hello. 
GUINAN: Clara and Isabella and I were just having a conversation. 
TROI: Would you and Isabella like to come for a walk with me? 
CLARA: I guess so. Bye. 
GUINAN: Bye, Clara. Bye, Isabella.
