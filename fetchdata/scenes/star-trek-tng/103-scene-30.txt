PICARD TROI CRUSHER DATA WESLEY

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Sir, I think Tasha's been infected too. 
[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: She just left my quarters, 
PICARD: Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nut
whatever it is, she's got it. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seems
our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. 
DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? 
PICARD: Forget it.

[Sickbay]

(Beverly is working in her office when Wesley calls
out to her) 
WESLEY: Hey, Mom, look what I can do. 
(She dashes into Sickbay to see him playing with his tractor beam
device) 
WESLEY: I've been able to widen and strengthen the beam, just like I
told you last night. 
CRUSHER: Do me a favour, Wes. There's something happening on this ship.
Just to be safe, I'd like you to stay in our quarters until it's
solved. 
WESLEY: Sure, Mom, sure. Your wish is my command. 
CRUSHER: Now, Wes. 
WESLEY: Okay, but you could be stunting my emotional growth, you
realise that. Why is it so hot in here, anyway? 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Crusher here. 
PICARD: Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indications
that this condition is spreading. 
CRUSHER: No test yet, Captain, but very soon.

[Corridor]

(Tasha is sashaying down the corridor, eyeing up
men, as other crew canoodle. She grabs a guy in blue and gives him a
long hard kiss) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, another forty-one minutes will see
the information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us. 
PICARD: Why so slow? 
DATA: Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating
it. 
PICARD: How much danger from that star? Worse case. 
DATA: Like a full collapse, sir? Any stellar material it threw this way
we could still outrun on half impulse power.
