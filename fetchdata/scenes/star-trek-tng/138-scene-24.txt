TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD CLERK RIKER WESLEY BELLBOY DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Progress? 
WESLEY: We've accessed the range of encoding scheme alternates. The
difficulty is in the frequency range. The interference is highly
variable. 
LAFORGE: See, the problem may be with the envelope covering the
structure. There are hydrogen-carbon helix patterns throughout. 
PICARD: Any transmissions are simply scattered and refracted at random.
No wonder you can't get through. 
LAFORGE: Exactly. 
PICARD: Those are some fairly aggressive computations, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: I'm comparing the molecular integrity of that bubble against
our phasers. 
PICARD: Is penetration possible? 
LAFORGE: I don't know just yet. It may be an option. I'd like to run
this test. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
[Lobby]

(The away team walk through the door, but end up
back in the lobby) 
RIKER: Let's try that again. 
(And again they fail to leave) 
RIKER: Let's find another way out of here. 
(Data approaches a woman at a slot machine) 
DATA: Excuse me. Excuse me. Aside from the main door, is there another
exit I might use? 
(She gets a jackpot, and takes no notice of him) 
DATA: Excuse me? 
RIKER: Excuse me. Say, I was wondering if you could tell me 
(But the man ignores him. Worf is pulling a slot machine away from the
wall to test the
paneling) 
RIKER: There's a good deal of structural integrity, Worf. 
WORF: Permission to use phaser, sir. 
RIKER: Granted. 
(The phaser has no effect on the wood) 
DATA: Sir, I can find no other exits. I believe we are trapped here.

Captain's log, supplemental. We remain in orbit
around Theta Eight, still out of contact with the away team.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We're almost there, Captain. We'll be able
to attempt contact in a few minutes. 
TROI: Captain, the situation down there has changed. 
PICARD: In what way? 
TROI: Commander Riker has become tense. Closed in, he's feeling
trapped. 
[Casino]

WORF: Phasers are totally ineffective on all
surfaces. 
DATA: Sir, our options appear quite limited. 
RIKER: We don't have any. If we're going to get out of here, we're
going to have to do it on our own. I'm going to get some answers out of
that desk clerk. 
[Lobby]

(The bellboy has taken a gun from a drawer) 
CLERK: Are you crazy? 
BELLBOY: Wrong. I'm finally getting some smarts. 
CLERK: You think you're going to scare Mickey D with that gun? 
BELLBOY: I'm going to make him leave Rita alone. 
CLERK: Kid, she's a big girl, and she's Mickey D's girl. 
BELLBOY: Not any more. Not after tonight. 
CLERK: Look, kid. I like you. I don't want to see you get hurt,
especially over some dame 
BELLBOY: Don't call her that. You'll see. You'll see how tough Mickey D
is. He's nothing. 
RIKER: I want some answers. 
CLERK: I'm sure the concierge will be delighted 
RIKER: We would like to get out of here. Now. 
CLERK: The Royale's exits are clearly marked. 
RIKER: That's not good enough. 
CLERK: If you have a complaint about the service you've received during
your stay here, you can always take it up with the manager. 
RIKER: Fine. I'd like to see him, immediately. 
CLERK: I'm afraid the manager is very busy. 
(The desk clerk leaves) 
PICARD [OC]: (faint) Riker, can you read me? 
RIKER: Yes.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: There's a good deal of interference,
but you are getting through. 
PICARD: Number One, why haven't you left that building? 
[Lobby]

RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trapped
here. We're in no immediate danger
