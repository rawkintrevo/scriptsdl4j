(the poker game is in full swing, and Beverly is
dealing) 
WORF: Commander, is it your intention to continue to grow your beard? 
LAFORGE: Actually, I'm not sure yet. Why, Worf? 
WORF: I am just asking. 
CRUSHER: Seven card stud, one-eyed jacks are wild. 
RIKER: Frankly, Geordi, I like the beard. 
LAFORGE: Thank you, Commander. 
CRUSHER: You know, I have always been a little suspicious of men with
beards. 
WORF: Why is that? 
CRUSHER: I don't know. It's as if they're trying to hide something. 
RIKER: Hide? Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. The beard is an ancient and
proud tradition. 
LAFORGE: Some of the most distinguished men in history have worn
beards, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I know. But after the razor was invented I think beards became
mostly a fashion statement. 
WORF: I'm not concerned with fashion. To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol
of courage. 
RIKER: I think it's a sign of strength. 
CRUSHER: Sure, and of course, women can't grow beards. 
LAFORGE: Doctor, it sounds to me like you feel beards are nothing more
than an affectation. 
CRUSHER: I do. But there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, women wear
makeup and nail polish. I just think it's time you men admitted it. 
RIKER: My beard is not an affectation. 
CRUSHER: Oh? Well then you wouldn't mind shaving it off. 
RIKER: I could lose it in a minute. I've just gotten used to it. 
CRUSHER: Okay, then why don't we up the stakes a little? And if I win,
all off you shave your beards off. 
LAFORGE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if you lose? What are you
going to give up? 
CRUSHER: I'm open for suggestions. 
RIKER: Well, I've always wanted to see you as a brunette. 
CRUSHER: Oh, I did that once when I was thirteen. I couldn't change
back fast enough. 
RIKER: That makes me even more curious. 
CRUSHER: Fine. If one of you wins, I become a brunette. Are we on? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, yeah, we'll take that bet. 
CRUSHER: Looks like you have the hand to beat, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Two hundred. 
CRUSHER: I'm in two hundred. 
RIKER: Geordi. 
PICARD [OC]: This is the Captain. We have arrived at the Tyran system.
All senior staff to the Bridge. 
CRUSHER: Wait! 
RIKER: Sorry, you heard the Captain. Duty calls. I guess we'll have to
do this some other time.

Captain's log, stardate 46307.2. We have just come
into orbit of Tyrus Seven A to monitor progress on the Tyran particle
fountain, a radically new mining technology. So far the project has
been fraught with problems, and is well behind schedule. Mister La
Forge has been assigned to evaluate the situation.
