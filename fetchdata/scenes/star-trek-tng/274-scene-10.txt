[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is sleeping) 
BOK: Picard, can you hear me? 
(Picard wakes to see Bok at the foot of his bed) 
BOK: I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it. 
PICARD: Security to Captain's quarters immediately. 
(but Bok has vanished)

[Engineering]

WORF: Our shields were up. How could he have beamed
through them? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure he did. Sensors don't show any sign of an
intruder. 
PICARD: Could it have been another hologram? 
LAFORGE: I don't think so, Captain. Something has to generate a
hologram. We would have detected it. 
PICARD: Bok once used a mind control device to make me hallucinate. 
LAFORGE: That device emitted a very specific energy signature. I'm not
reading anything like that. 
WORF: Could he have modified the device so he could use it without
being detected? 
LAFORGE: It's possible. I'll recalibrate the sensors to scan for low
intensity transmissions. Just to be sure, I'll sweep your quarters with
a resonance scanner. 
PICARD: Good. Keep me posted. 
(La Forge leaves) 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to assign a security detail to Jason. 
WORF: And what about yourself? 
PICARD: I am not the target of Bok's threats. Jason is. 
DATA: Captain, I have compiled all available records pertaining to
Jason Vigo's criminal record, and 
PICARD: Criminal record? 
DATA: Yes, sir. He has been charged three times with petty theft, twice
for disorderly conduct, and several dozen times for trespassing. 
PICARD: Trespassing? 
DATA: I believe the charges relate to his climbing activities in the
caves underneath the planet's surface. This is the information you
requested, is it not? 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data.
