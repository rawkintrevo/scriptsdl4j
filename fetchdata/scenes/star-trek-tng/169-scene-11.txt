[Engineering]

DATA: Nucleosynthesis. The structure of the glass
has been altered at the atomic level. 
LAFORGE: A problem with the replicator? 
DATA: Unlikely. A problem with the replicator would have affected the
contents as well as the glass. But the liquid in the glass was a
synthehol replication of a light ale of Earth origin, which is, I
believe what Lieutenant Duffy ordered. 
LAFORGE: I can't detect any residual radiation or unusual chemical
compounds that would have caused this. 
DATA: The most probable explanation is that the glass came into contact
with an unshielded power source. 
LAFORGE: That means a complete diagnostic check of the Enterprise power
systems. All four thousand of them. Do I have the perfect man for this
job. Hey, Reg. Busy? 
BARCLAY: Well, I was just. No, not really. Why? 
LAFORGE: I've got another mystery for you. Somehow the molecular
structure of this cup from Ten Forward has been altered. We need to run
through the power systems to see if there's a leak that caused this. 
BARCLAY: I had, I was going to do that. 
LAFORGE: You were? 
BARCLAY: Yes. To, to try to explain the anti-grav unit failure. I still
can't. Nothing about it makes sense. 
DATA: Then it is possible these two very disparate incidents could be
related.

[Bridge]

(Geordi is at a rear station, showing Riker the
glass) 
LAFORGE: I wouldn't bother you with something this minor, Commander,
but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem. 
RIKER: Do you think we'll need to put in to a starbase? 
LAFORGE: We'll have a better idea after Mister Barclay runs a check on
the power systems. 
DATA: It was Lieutenant Barclay who first suggested a link between the
two incidents. 
BARCLAY: What? No, it wasn't. I mean, not really. 
PICARD: Will your investigation affect our available power during the
mission? 
BARCLAY: No, No, sir. We'll have to shut off some systems. We'll shut
them down a few at a time. It shouldn't. I don't think so. 
PICARD: Good. I look forward to your report, Mister Broccoli. (big
silence) Barclay. 
BARCLAY: If you will excuse me. 
(Barclay leaves) 
DATA: Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors,
sir. A reversal of vowel and consonant, Barc to Broc. 
(Suddenly Data becomes fascinated by something on a control panel)

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: Yes, I know him comes in. He stands at the
bar. He doesn't say much. He orders a warm milk. 
LAFORGE: Figures. 
GUINAN: Warm milk helps you sleep, La Forge. You should try it. What's
this have to do with Barclay? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I'm just trying to figure the man out. Do you
ever talk to him? 
GUINAN: He doesn't talk much. 
LAFORGE: Does he have any friends? 
GUINAN: Not that I've seen. 
LAFORGE: What do you do with a guy like that? 
GUINAN: Well, I just serve him warm milk and let him be. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky. I can't let him be. He's my
problem. 
GUINAN: Well, he's imaginative. 
LAFORGE: How do you know that? 
GUINAN: I know. 
LAFORGE: Well, then maybe he's in the wrong line of work. 
GUINAN: You engineering types don't appreciate imagination? 
LAFORGE: That's not it, Guinan. He just doesn't fit in here. 
GUINAN: Terkim. 
LAFORGE: What? 
GUINAN: Reminds me of Terkim. My mother's brother. Sort of the family
misfit. Everybody told me to stay away from him. Bad influence. 
LAFORGE: Did you? 
GUINAN: Are you kidding? He was the only member of the family who had a
sense of humour. Except no one ever stayed around him long enough to
realize it but me. My mother tells me I remind her of him, and I
probably do. The idea of fitting in just repels me. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I'm not make myself clear, Guinan. Barclay, well, he's
always late. The man's nervous. Nobody wants to be around this guy. 
GUINAN: If I felt that nobody wanted to be around me, I'd probably be
late and nervous too. 
LAFORGE: Guinan, that's not the point. 
GUINAN: Are you sure? Excuse me. 
LAFORGE: Computer, where is Lieutenant Barclay?
