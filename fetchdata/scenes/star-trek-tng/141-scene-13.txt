WESLEY: Hi. Can I walk with you? 
TROI: Yes. 
WESLEY: I need a little advice. 
RIKER: Well, it's free. 
WESLEY: Walking or advice? 
RIKER: Both. 
WESLEY: It's about my team. I'm considering so many factors I'm
confusing myself. 
TROI: What have you done so far? 
WESLEY: Well, I've broken down the task and picked the best people in
those disciplines. 
RIKER: So who have you got so far? 
WESLEY: I've got Prixus in mineralogy and metallurgy, Alans and
Hildebrandt for volcanology and geomechanics. I want Davies for
geochemistry, but 
TROI: But they're all much older than you are. 
WESLEY: Right, and it makes me feel strange. What do I do about
personality conflicts? 
RIKER: Completely irrelevant. These people are professionals. If
there's a personality conflict, you're in charge, you settle it. 
WESLEY: So you not only have to understand the job, you also have to be
a ship's Counsellor. 
TROI: Sometimes. 
WESLEY: Well, thank you.

Captain's log, Stardate 42696.3. We are entering
the second Selcundi star system, where acting Ensign Crusher will begin
his planetary mineral survey. The results of which may help unlock the
geological puzzle.

WESLEY: Ensign Davies? 
DAVIES: You got him. 
WESLEY: Wesley Crusher. I've been put in charge of the planetary
geological surveys, and I'd like to have you on the team. 
DAVIES: Sounds great. Who else is on it? 
WESLEY: I have Prixus and Alans and Hildebrandt. 
DAVIES: It's a shame you didn't talk to me first. It's just personal
opinion, but I like to break up married teams. 
WESLEY: I hadn't thought of that. 
DAVIES: Don't worry, they'll probably work out fine. And if you need
any help, just give me a signal and I'll take over for you. We don't
want you to get too beat up on your first command. 
WESLEY: Thanks, but I'm pretty sure I'll be all right.

with intent, and a PADD) 
PULASKI: Wes? 
WESLEY: Hi, Doctor Pulaski. 
PULASKI: You have trouble behind that door? 
WESLEY: My team's in there. I've got to assign planets, set a schedule.

PULASKI: It sounds like you've got everything under control. 
WESLEY: I haven't had to deal with them yet. Not together, not
professionally. 
PULASKI: Wes, the minute you walk through that door they're your team.
You have nothing to prove. You've got the authority. 
WESLEY: That's just 'cos Commander Riker says I do. 
PULASKI: It's up to you to hang on to it. Now, you'd better get in
there, and Wes, for whatever it's worth, I think you're going to do
just fine. 
Captain's log, stardate 42737.3. It has been six
weeks since our entrance into the Selcundi Drema sector. Each system
has revealed the same disturbing geological upheavals on every planet.
