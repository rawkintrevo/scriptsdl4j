[Transporter room]

DATA: Our attempt to transport the chair never
occurred.

[Engineering]

PICARD: You wanted to see me? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain. I think I've found a way to reinstate your vocal
authorisations. Give it a try. 
PICARD: Computer, route all command functions to this location. 
COMPUTER: Command functions are offline. 
PICARD: Reinitialise them on my authorisation. 
COMPUTER: Please input command codes. 
PICARD: Picard, epsilon seven nine three. 
COMPUTER: Command codes verified. 
LAFORGE: That's it. That should do it. Wait a minute. It didn't work.
The computer won't release the command pathways. 
DATA: Geordi. 
(Data throws a small device to La Forge, who catches it in his left
hand) 
LAFORGE: Why did you do that, Data? 
DATA: Captain, I have determined how Moriarty was able to leave the
holodeck. He never did. Neither did we. None of this is real. It is a
simulation. We are still on the holodeck. 
LAFORGE: We're still on the holodeck? 
PICARD: How do you know that? 
DATA: Through deduction, sir. Lieutenant Barclay and I tried to
transport a simulated object off the holodeck, something that has never
been attempted. Since the transporter itself is a simulation, the
computer had no real data from which to create the transport logs. 
LAFORGE: Maybe it was just a malfunction in the transporter. 
DATA: Then I saw you working the PADD with your left hand. Commander La
Forge is right handed, sir. A similar malfunction occurred in the
Sherlock Holmes programme I was running before Moriarty first appeared.

PICARD: Mister Data, if what you say is true, then this is not Geordi
La Forge. Are you certain? 
(Data throws his comm., badge towards the warp core. The grid appears
for a moment) 
PICARD: Computer, discontinue programme. Computer, exit. 
DATA: Moriarty appears to have programmed the holodeck to accept only
his commands. 
PICARD: Picard to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PICARD: Number One, what is my present location? 
RIKER [OC]: Engineering. Is something wrong, sir? 
PICARD: No. Thank you. Picard out. Our comm. badges must be locked into
the simulation. If that had been the real Commander Riker, he would
have given my location as holodeck three. Mister La Forge, will you
excuse us, please? 
(Geordi leaves) 
PICARD: Mister Data, who is real here? 
DATA: You and I are real, sir, as is Lieutenant Barclay. We entered the
holodeck together when we first went to see Moriarty. 
PICARD: And from that point we have been existing in a holodeck
simulation created by Professor Moriarty? 
DATA: I believe that is the case, sir. 
PICARD: I have just given the computer my command codes, thinking I
would get control of the ship. 
DATA: You may have inadvertently given Professor Moriarty the means of
gaining control of the real Enterprise. 
PICARD: Since Professor Moriarty never actually left the holodeck, he
may demand that Commander Riker help him to do so. How long until the
planetary collision? 
DATA: Less than three hours. 
PICARD: So long as Moriarty has control of the ship, we are vulnerable.
Somehow, I have to find a way of giving him what he wants.
