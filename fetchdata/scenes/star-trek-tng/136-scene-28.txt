[Corridor]

WESLEY: What is it? What happened? Salia! 
SALIA: Stay away from me! I'm sorry. 
WESLEY: I don't understand. 
SALIA: I can't stay here! I can't have this life! I want it more than
anything, but I can't have it! 
WESLEY: Salia, nothing is impossible. 
SALIA: Not for you. 
WESLEY: There's a way. I know there is! 
(Picard, Anya and a guard come round the corner) 
ANYA: Leave her alone! 
PICARD: Ensign, step away from her. 
ANYA: (to Salia) Come with me.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Energy depletion level? 
COMPUTER: Zero. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: I've just completed my final adjustments. Thanks for the time.
You now have warp engines available. 
PICARD [OC]: Very good.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, get us to Daled as quickly as
possible. 
RIKER: Ensign Gibson, take us to warp eight point eight. 
GIBSON: (a strawberry blonde) Warp eight point eight, sir. 
RIKER: Estimated time? 
GIBSON: Three hours, nine minutes. 
PICARD: Ensign Crusher, when you're finished with your duties in
Engineering, report to my Ready Room. 
WESLEY [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: The woman, Anya, is not what she appears to
be. She is an allasomorph. 
WESLEY: A shape shifter? 
PICARD: Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl's
protector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personal
relationships of those under my command, but in this case. 
WESLEY: You want me to stay away from Salia? 
PICARD: Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyone
on board. 
WESLEY: I will do as you ask.

[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Why won't you let me have a friend? 
ANYA: It is my duty to protect you from danger. 
SALIA: There's no danger here. 
ANYA: There is always danger from one who is not your kind. Salia, he's
confusing you. You're forgetting you responsibilities. 
SALIA: Whether or not I see Wesley is for me to decide. 
ANYA: It is not! I raised you, I protected you and I intend to deliver
you to Daled Four! 
SALIA: Maybe what you want doesn't matter any more. 
ANYA: Salia, please. I know it's difficult for you. But you must do
what you are destined to do.
