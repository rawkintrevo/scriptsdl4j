RIKER: Status on the repair? 
LAFORGE: Working on it. 
WESLEY: Commander, what do you think of Captain Okona? 
RIKER: Well, Okona is an interesting man, certainly. We've seen how he
handles his ship. Apparently he knows how to handle people as well. 
WESLEY: Then why does he work alone? 
RIKER: He's a man who lives his life by his own rules. He does what he
does by choice. By his choice. Someday you'll make yours. 
WESLEY: I already have.

DATA: So you agree with Okona that I am missing a
very important human factor. 
GUINAN: I never said that. I simply said that I've never seen you
laugh. 
DATA: I am capable of that function when it is expected of me. 
GUINAN: Data, do you even know what a joke is? 
DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, a
fluctuation of 
GUINAN: Stop. Look, it's just you and I here. We're talking, we're
having an intimate conversation. Why? Because you're a 'droid and I'm a
'noid. 
DATA: But why? 
GUINAN: Because that's what I am. 
DATA: Have I said something to offend you? 
GUINAN: No. 
DATA: Then why are you annoyed? 
GUINAN: Because you're a 'droid and I'm a 'noid. 
DATA: Humanoid. 
GUINAN: Yes. 
DATA: You told a joke. 
GUINAN: Yes. 
DATA: I am not laughing. 
GUINAN: Yes. 
DATA: Perhaps the joke was not funny. 
GUINAN: No, the joke was funny. It's you, Data. 
DATA: Are you sure? 
GUINAN: Yes. 
DATA: I agree. What do I do? 
GUINAN: Well, under normal circumstances, I'd say seek a higher power.
But in your case, probably a smarter computer is in order.
