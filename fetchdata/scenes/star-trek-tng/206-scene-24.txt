[Bridge]

WORF: The vessel is approaching, Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, all senior officers report to the Bridge. On screen. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Report. 
PICARD: Welcome, Etana. The Enterprise has been secured. We await your
further instructions. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: The expansion will proceed as follows. Commander
Riker, you will pilot a shuttlecraft to the Cleon system, where you
will rendezvous with the starship Endeavour. Proceed with distributing
the device to that vessel. Commander La Forge, Counsellor Troi, take a
shuttle to Starbase sixty seven. Distribute the device to all starships
currently docked there. 
PICARD: We also have an opportunity to introduce the game to Starfleet
Academy. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Excellent. See to it. The Ktarians commend your
efforts, Picard. Once the expansion is complete, you and your crew will
be rewarded.

WESLEY: Deck thirty six. 
ALYSSA: Wesley, at what level are you? 
WESLEY: I'm only level ten. 
ALYSSA: I'm at level forty seven. 
WESLEY: That's great. 
ALYSSA: You know what the secret is, don't you? Don't force it. If you
just let the game happen, it almost plays itself. 
WESLEY: I'll try that. 
[Engineering]

WESLEY: I think we're going to be okay. I've just
got one more thing to do. Help me compile the forcefield overrides. 
ROBIN: What are you doing? 
WESLEY: I created a site to site transporter programme. If things get
difficult, this'll keep us one step ahead of them. Were able to access
the security tracking codes? Robin? 
ROBIN: It's your turn, Wesley. Play the game. 
(Riker and Worf approach, Wesley runs) 
RIKER: Get back here!
