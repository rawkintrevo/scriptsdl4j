[Turbolift]

(with Jay Gordon on Picard's shoulders, they get
the hatch open) 
PICARD: Can you climb up? 
JAY GORDON: Yes, I think so. 
PICARD: Good. Now look down the sides of the lift. Can you see two big
clamps? 
JAY GORDON: Yes, I see them. 
PICARD: Can you see if those clamps are attached to long beams inside
big grooves? 
JAY GORDON: Yes. But one of them looks broken. It's half out of the
groove. 
PICARD: All right. Come down. 
(Picard catches him) 
PICARD: All right. Number One, those big clamps are part of the
emergency system. If something goes wrong, they're designed to hold the
turbolift in place. But it would seem that they're damaged. 
MARISSA: Is that why we keep shaking? 
PICARD: That's right. Now, when they give way, we shall fall. So you've
got to get your crew out of here before that happens. Now, there is a
ladder along the wall of the shaft. You can climb up that until you
come to an open doorway. 
MARISSA: What about you? 
PICARD: My ankle is broken. I will just slow you down when you need to
move quickly. Now, you are the leader. And that's an order. 
MARISSA: We have to climb up the shaft. 
PATTERSON: I want to stay here with you, Captain. 
PICARD: Patterson, you're an officer. You have to obey orders. 
PATTERSON: I don't want to be an officer any more. I want to stay here
with you. 
JAY GORDON: If the captain stays here, we won't make it. We'll all die.

PICARD: We don't have time to argue. You must go now. 
MARISSA: The crew has decided to stick together. We all go or we all
stay. 
PICARD: All right. I'll try. But I want you to know this is mutiny.
Now, Number One, look at that control panel. Now, the yellow control
pad, hit that once. Now the one below it, hit twice. Now that should
release the panel underneath. 
MARISSA: Yes, it did. 
PICARD: Now, you can pull it away. 
MARISSA: Okay. 
PICARD: Good. Now, that bundle of wires, that's optical cabling. See
how much of that you can pull out. 
[Cargo bay]

(they've moved the containers) 
CRUSHER: The levels are still rising. There must be some way to put
that fire out. 
LAFORGE: The energy's being fed by the ship's internal power grid and
we can't even get near that. The only way to stop it would be to
eliminate its supply of oxygen. Wait a minute. Doctor, I've got an
idea. It's kind or wild, but we just might be able to kill two birds
with one stone. 
CRUSHER: Let's hear it. 
LAFORGE: Okay. We open the external door. That would depressurise the
cargo bay and suck all of those containers out into space. At the same
time, the lack of oxygen should put out the plasma fire. 
CRUSHER: What about us? 
LAFORGE: We just need to find something in here to hold onto while the
air is evacuating. Then, we close the door, repressurise the bay. 
CRUSHER: What about this? 
(a ladder up to the second level) 
LAFORGE: Yeah, that ought to do it.
