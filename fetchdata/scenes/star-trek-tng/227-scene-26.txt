DATA: The binary message left by the Captain is not
entirely clear. He seemed to be concerned about the phase differential
of our photon torpedoes. That firing them might produce catastrophic
effects. 
CRUSHER: Then how do we destroy their habitat? 
DATA: If I am correct, we must modify our weapons so that the force of
the explosion is re-phased into the aliens' time continuum. 
LAFORGE: If we outfit the photons with phase discriminators we could
get the variance we need. 
RIKER: How long will it take you? 
LAFORGE: At least a couple of hours. 
RIKER: Fine. I'll have time to go get him. 
DATA: Sir? 
RIKER: I'm going back to the nineteenth century to get the Captain.
Doctor? 
CRUSHER: My analysis of the phasers suggests you'd be able to open the
rift, but it won't be stable enough to transport more than one person. 
RIKER: You mean if I go back, only one of us can return? 
CRUSHER: That's right. 
CLEMENS: Then I have the perfect solution for you. I'm the one who
should return to the nineteenth century and remain there so your
Captain can return here. 
RIKER: There's a risk. We're not sure how stable the rift will be. 
CLEMENS: There's risk in everything. The point is, it's the right
choice. I've got more books to write, and your Captain has a job to do
here. 
RIKER: Geordi, you'll brief him on what he needs to know? 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
CLEMENS: I'm glad I have the chance to thank you. 
DATA: For what, sir? 
CLEMENS: Why, for starting me out on the greatest adventure a man's
ever had. And for helping a bitter old man to open his eyes and see
that the future turned out pretty well after all.

GUINAN: I'm thirsty. 
PICARD: I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here. 
GUINAN: No, don't go. They'll be back for you soon. 
PICARD: No, you need help. 
CLEMENS: This thing put me down in the middle of Market Street. Took
forever to get here.

WORF: Commander La Forge has completed the
reconfiguration of the photon torpedoes. 
RIKER: If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now. 
WORF: We have no way of knowing if Mister Clemens was successful. 
RIKER: Re-establish your firing pattern, Mister Worf. We'll wait five
more minutes. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Cavern]

CLEMENS: No time for chit chat, sir. According to
Mister La Forge, who did get your message by the way, a frequency
setting of point oh four seven on your phaser will correctly activate
this creature. 
PICARD: Now you have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention. 
CLEMENS: I promise you she will be attended to. 
PICARD: And there is a bill to be settled at Mrs. Carmichael's boarding
house. 
CLEMENS: I'll settle it. 
PICARD: Thank you. I wish, I wish time would have allowed me to know
you better. 
CLEMENS: You'll just have to read my books. What I am is pretty much
there. 
GUINAN: I'll see you in five hundred years, Picard. 
PICARD: And I'll see you in a few minutes.
