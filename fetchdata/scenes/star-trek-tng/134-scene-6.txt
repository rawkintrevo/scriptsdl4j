PULASKI PICARD RIKER WORF

[Ten Forward]

(Riker has plates and bowls of alien protein on his
table. You expect some of it to get up and walk away) 
PULASKI: What is that? 
RIKER: It's a Klingon delicacy. Pipius claw. This is heart of targ.
This, of course, is gagh. 
PULASKI: Gagh? 
RIKER: Yes, serpent worms. Would you like some? 
PULASKI: No, thanks. I've never heard of a Klingon starving to death on
his own vessels, but you might. 
RIKER: Not if I weaken first. 
PULASKI: I know all about that. Their beliefs are rather brutal, but
usually what kills us kills them. 
RIKER: That's certainly good to know. Would you like something to
drink? 
PULASKI: I'm abstaining in honour of your last hour on board. 
RIKER: Your sacrifice will not go unnoticed. 
PICARD: Well, I'm familiar with the practice of the feast before the
transfer. I've done it dozens of times. However, I usually made more
palatable choices. 
RIKER: These are the more palatable choices. 
(Riker offers Picard a jug of something rather solid-looking with
tentacles) 
PICARD: Thank you. We know so little about them. There really is so
much to learn. This is a great opportunity. I envy you, Mister Riker. 
(Another tray of dishes arrives, and Riker tucks in while Picard leans
back and Pulaski wrinkles her nose) 
[Corridor]

WORF: Commander. 
(He gives Riker a small metal tube) 
RIKER: An emergency transponder? 
WORF: Slightly altered to transmit an omnidirectional signal and an
emergency call. 
RIKER: You suspect trouble? 
WORF: Simply a security precaution. I want to insure your return to
this ship. 
RIKER: Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf? 
WORF: Efficiency, Commander. 
RIKER: I understand. Thank you.
