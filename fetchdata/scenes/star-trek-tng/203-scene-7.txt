PICARD RIKER RO KENNELLY

[Transporter room]

RIKER: The transfer of a new officer to the
Enterprise? 
PICARD [OC]: Negative 
RIKER: Well, we've got one, waiting to beam aboard complete with
orders. 
[Observation lounge]

RIKER [OC]: Ensign Ro Laren. 
PICARD: Ro Laren? From the Wellington? 
RIKER [OC]:: The same one, sir. Shall I tell her there's been some
mistake? 
PICARD: Stand by, Commander. 
KENNELLY: I wrote the orders. I thought she might be valuable to you. 
PICARD: Admiral, respectfully. I would appreciate consulting rights on
the assignment of a new officer, especially one with the record of Ro
Laren. 
KENNELLY: She's Bajoran. 
PICARD: There are other Bajorans in Starfleet. Assign one of them. 
KENNELLY: I've discussed this situation with her, and I am convinced
that she is the right one for this job. 
PICARD: After what happened on Garon Two, she has no business serving
on any starship, let alone the flagship, my ship. 
KENNELLY: You're taking her, Captain. It's been arranged. I can't tell
you how difficult it was to get her out of prison. 
PICARD: It's that important to you? 
KENNELLY: It's that important to the mission. 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Go ahead. 
PICARD: Proceed with the transport. 
RIKER [OC]: Sir? 
PICARD: I'll fill you in later. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: I hope you and I don't regret this, Admiral. 
KENNELLY: You can handle her, Captain, if anyone can.
