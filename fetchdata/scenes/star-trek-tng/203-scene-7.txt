[Bajoran camp]

(Ro gives her uniform jacket to a young girl) 
RO: This used to be me. 
GUEST4: Baleekam. Balleek, balleek. Baleekam! Baleek. 
(the children scatter) 
GUEST4: Ro Laren. It's been a long time. 
RO: Keeve Falor, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander Data and Lieutenant
Worf. 
PICARD: I'm pleased you agreed to meet with us, Mister Keeve. 
GUEST4: You honour me by the proper use of my name, Captain. 
PICARD: Ensign Ro has educated me. 
GUEST4: Has she? I'm pleased you still remember. Let me show you our
camp. We are not a violent race, Captain. Just passionate about our
cause. And that passion has led some to take up arms. 
PICARD: Do you know where we can find Orta? 
GUEST4: I'm afraid not. 
PICARD: Can you help us locate him? 
GUEST4: I'm sorry, I don't wish to help you. Don't misunderstand. I for
one believe the raid on the Federation outpost was poor judgment. You
are innocent bystanders, and I cannot condone violence against those
who are not our enemies. 
PICARD: Then I don't understand why you are unwilling? 
GUEST4: Because you are innocent bystanders. You were innocent
bystanders for decades as the Cardassians took our homes, as they
violated and tortured our people in the most hideous ways imaginable,
as we were forced to flee. 
PICARD: We were saddened by those events but they occurred within the
designated borders of the Cardassian Empire. 
GUEST4: And the Federation is pledged not to interfere in the internal
affairs of others. How convenient that must be for you,
to turn a deaf ear to those who suffer behind a line on a map. 
PICARD: Well, I'm not here to debate Federation policy with you, but I
can offer you assistance. 
GUEST4: Simply because of one terrorist attack? Perhaps I should have
known that. We should have attacked the Federation long ago. What do
you think of that, Ro? 
RO: I think you're a small man who feels a rush of power in his belly
and enjoys it far too much, Keeve. Stop talking and listen. 
PICARD: We've had our problems with the Cardassians too, but now that
we have a treaty, we're in a position to help. Your people have been
forced to resettle all over the quadrant. But now we can make a
legitimate case with the Cardassians that this is not an isolated
problem. We can work diplomatically on your behalf. But first, these
terrorist attacks must end. 
GUEST4: We live in different universes, you and I. Yours is about
diplomacy, politics, strategy. Mine is about blankets. If we were to
exchange places for one night, you might better understand. 
PICARD: Mister Data, see to it that the replicators provide a blanket
for every man, woman and child before nightfall. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Data leaves) 
PICARD: Mister Worf, determine what these people may have in the way of
emergency needs and provide for them. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
(Worf leaves) 
GUEST4: Thank you. Return to your ship. I will contact you when I have
any information that might be of assistance to you. Ensign. 
(Keeve leaves them)
PICARD: You were helpful. 
RO: The blankets were helpful. Nothing I said mattered. 
PICARD: In an age when their technology should be able to clothe and
feed all of them, that they should have to live like this. 
RO: I couldn't, and I wouldn't. That's one reason I ran away. They're
lost, defeated. I will never be.

Captain's log, stardate 45077.8. Keeve Falor has
kept his promise and directed us toward the third moon of Valo One,
where we will meet tomorrow with the terrorist leader, Orta.
