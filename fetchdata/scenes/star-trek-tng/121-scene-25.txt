[Jungle]

DATA: Typically, the purpose of such an enclosure
is for storage. 
PICARD [OC]: Which would suggest what? 
TASHA: That sooner or later someone or something will be along to
collect him. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by. I'm coming down. 
TROI: You, sir? 
PICARD: Yes. Doctor Crusher, this is the Captain. Meet me in
Transporter room three. Mister La Forge, you have command of the
Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: And whatever happens down there, your prime responsibility is
to the ship. 
LAFORGE: Understood, sir. 
TROI: Captain, I take great exception to your decision to beam down. 
PICARD: Noted.

[Transporter room]

CRUSHER: Is it just Riker? 
PICARD: Yes. Apparently he's confined in some sort of force field.
Energise.

[Jungle]

PICARD: Any changes? 
TASHA: Data's figured out what it is. 
CRUSHER: Are you getting any life signs? 
DATA: He is alive. What appeared in the form of Captain Rice is an
intelligence gathering device used during the Ersalrope Wars. 
TASHA: Probably developed here. 
DATA: It projects an image of someone the subject will trust, gets as
much information as possible. 
TASHA: If it's found out, it encases the subject to await a more
detailed interrogation later. 
CRUSHER: Clever. 
PICARD: Can you remove it? 
DATA: Possibly, but I will need to know the exact frequency and I
cannot determine the risk to Commander Riker. 
PICARD: We have little choice. Whatever has him is interrupting the
transporter beam. Remove it. 
DATA: (adjusting his phaser) This will take some time, sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: I am picking up energy readings. 
LAFORGE: Captain, Lieutenant La Forge here. Sensors indicate energy
readings in your area.

[Jungle]

(As Data tries to neutralise the force field,
another device arrives and starts shooting) 
PICARD: Doctor, over here! 
(Picard and Beverly run, right to the edge of a pit, where they fall
into)

[Cavern]

PICARD: Doctor. 
(Picard is unhurt, but Beverly is injured)
