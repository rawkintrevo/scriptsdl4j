WORF NAUSICAAN PICARD Q COREY MARTA DATA

[Bonestell Facility casino]

PICARD: I think you'll like serving on board the
Ajax. I hear that Captain Narth is an excellent officer. 
COREY: So I hear. 
PICARD: Well, here's to the class of 'twenty seven. 
(three Nausicaans enter) 
NAUSICAAN: Play dom-jot, human. Give you a better chance. Give you a
bigger stick maybe. 
PICARD: I don't think we're interested. 
NAUSICAAN 1: They are undari. Cowards. 
COREY: What did you say? 
NAUSICAAN: Coward. Like all Starfleet you talk and you talk, but you
have no guramba. 
COREY: Why don't we find out. 
PICARD: Don't be a fool, Corey. Look, there are plenty of other people
to play dom-jot with. Now just go about your business. 
NAUSICAAN: Maybe I play with her. Give her good time. 
(Corey is about to hit the Nausicaan when Picard pushes him over) 
NAUSICAAN: Orcho lok resnik. Starfleet. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Corey. He was reaching for a weapon. 
COREY: I don't know who you are any more, but you're not my friend. 
MARTA: Goodbye, Johnny. 
(Corey and Marta leave) 
Q: Congratulations, mon capitaine. You did it. 
WORF [OC]: Can I help you?

[Bridge]

(Picard is a science lieutenant) 
WORF: Can I help you, Mister Picard? 
PICARD: Mister Worf. 
(Worf takes a PADD from Picard) 
WORF: This is not for me. You should take it to Commander La Forge in
Engineering. 
PICARD: What's happened? 
WORF: Is something wrong? 
PICARD: I'm not sure. Mister Worf, what is my rank and position? 
WORF: You are a Lieutenant junior grade, Assistant Astrophysics
officer. 
DATA: Are you feeling all right? 
PICARD: Who's the captain of this ship? 
DATA: Captain Thomas Halloway. Perhaps I should escort you to Sickbay. 
PICARD: No. I can find my own way there. Thank you, Commander.
