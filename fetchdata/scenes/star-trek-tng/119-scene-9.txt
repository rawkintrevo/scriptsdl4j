said questions presence hyperspace face tanks ask unnerving starbase

[Classroom]

COMPUTER: Last question on the hyperspace physics
test. If the matter and antimatter tanks on a Galaxy class starship are
nine tenths depleted, calculate the intermix ratio necessary to reach a
starbase a hundred light years away at warp factor eight. Begin. 
(Wesley is straight in with 1:1. Oliana runs out of time) 
COMPUTER: Time elapsed. You now have one hour free before the next
test. 
MORDOCK: I must admit, Wesley, you have a very fast mind. 
WESLEY: Once as I realised it was a trick question, there was only one
answer. 
MORDOCK: Yes, there is only one ratio with matter antimatter. One to
one. 
OLIANA: You don't know how lucky you are. I can't imagine what it would
be like to have things come so easily. I have to push every step of the
way. 
WESLEY: Oh, no, Oliana, it doesn't come that easily. I have to study
all the time. 
OLIANA: It's a good thing you're cute, Wesley, or you could really be
obnoxious. See you later. 
(Oliana leaves) 
WESLEY: Did you hear what she said, Mordock? She said I was cute. 
MORDOCK: Is that good, Wesley? 
WESLEY: Yes! I think. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I think I should apologise, Captain. 
PICARD: No need, Number One. Mister Remmick's presence is unnerving, to
say the least. 
REMMICK: Are you available now, Mister Riker? Or do you still have
duties to perform? 
RIKER: I'm available, Mister Remmick. 
REMMICK: Any problem with using your Ready room, Captain? 
PICARD: No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest.

[Ready room]

(Remmick sits himself in the Captain's chair and
gestures Riker to sit too)
REMMICK: If you prefer to stand, fine, Mister Riker. It won't have an
effect on the length of my inquiry. (Riker sits) Now, there are several
seeming discrepancies in the Captain's log. Let's go over them one by
one, shall we? 
RIKER: The Captain's log? 
REMMICK: Yes. To the best of your knowledge, has the Captain ever
falsified a log? 
RIKER: Have you discussed this with him? 
REMMICK: Right now, I'm asking you. 
RIKER: If you want to discuss anything about Captain Picard, you bring
him in here and ask him face to face. 
REMMICK: You are required to answer my questions, Mister Riker, unless
you're trying to cover something up! Now, there are several
discrepancies in the Captain's log. Shall we go over them one by one? 
RIKER: Proceed.
