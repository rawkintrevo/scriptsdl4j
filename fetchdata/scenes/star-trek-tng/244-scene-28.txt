KELSEY: I wouldn't need to improvise if you hadn't
damaged our field diverter. But if you're so concerned about the
trilithium 
[Worf's quarters]

KELSEY [OC]: I suggest you stop interfering with us

[Engineering]

KELSEY: Before you set off an explosion that would
destroy the Enterprise and you. 
[Worf's quarters]

PICARD: I would rather destroy the ship than allow
that material to fall into the hands of terrorists. 
[Engineering]

KELSEY: What makes you think I'm a terrorist? 
[Worf's quarters]

PICARD: Trilithium resin is a highly toxic waste
product produced by our engines. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: It's only possible use could be as a
weapon. 
KELSEY: You might be right, Mister Mot, but we've been planning this
for a long time, and I doubt that you'll really be able to stop us. 
(mouths 'find him' to Pomet)
KELSEY: Or even slow us down. 
(Picard sets out with Worf's crossbow) 
NEIL: There. Three hundred milligrams of trilithium. I'm using a
dynamic stabiliser to act as a control rod. There. That should keep the
resin stable enough for transport. 
KELSEY: Come on! Don't be so tense, Neil. If something goes wrong, you
won't have time to worry about it. Let's go. 
(in Sickbay, Picard dips the tip of the crossbow bolt into a liquid)

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: Three more decks, then we take corridor
fifteen B all the way to Ten Forward. 
(She stops climbing. The next set of ladders is missing.) 
NEIL: What's wrong? 
KELSEY: We have to find another way up. The rungs are cut. 
[Sickbay]

(Picard is mixing up ingredients) 
KELSEY [OC]: That wasn't very clever, Mister Mot.
