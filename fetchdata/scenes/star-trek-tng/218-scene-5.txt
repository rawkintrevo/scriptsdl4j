TROI CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER RO DATA

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: As you can see, the Typhon Expanse is
huge. If we want to chart the most remote star system, we'll have to
launch a probe within the next few hours. 
RIKER: Fine. What about the luminosity studies? 
LAFORGE: That may pose a problem. 
PICARD: How so? 
LAFORGE: The flux spectrometers are still down for re-alignment. 
RIKER: I thought they were supposed to be back online yesterday. 
LAFORGE: They were, until the stellar dynamics lab decided they needed
to install new modules. 
DATA: I recommend we use a gravitron polarimeter. It will perform a
similar function. 
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Data. 
CRUSHER: Captain, I have something I'd like to report. 
PICARD: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I heard voices in my room last night. I was alone, so at first
I thought I was imagining things. But this morning, ten other people
reported hearing them at the same time I did. 
TROI: What were the voices saying? 
CRUSHER: I couldn't make them out. 
RIKER: Data, did the sensors pick up anything unusual last night? 
DATA: No anomalous readings were reported. 
RIKER: When we're through here, re-check the sensor logs. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: I sensed nothing unusual last night. 
LAFORGE: Maybe it's a problem with the comm. system. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: We are getting unusual readings twenty thousand kilometres
off the starboard bow. 
PICARD: On our way. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Report. 
RO: Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon until we were almost on top of
it, sir. 
WORF: It is a highly localised distortion of the space-time continuum. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(a blue weird thing) 
PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. 
RO: Aye sir. Captain, manoeuvring thrusters are not responding. 
DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. 
LAFORGE: All main systems just went down. Power levels are dropping
rapidly. 
RIKER: Red alert. 
DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. 
TROI: We have to get out of here now. 
DATA: Captain, something is emerging. 
(it's a smaller starship) 
RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. 
WORF: Shields inoperative. 
RO: The helm's not responding. 
DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty six
seconds. 
PICARD: Hail them. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Suggestions? 
RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may kick us
out of the way. 
DATA: Captain, I suggest we use the tractor beam to alter the other
ship's trajectory. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, make it so. 
WORF: Engaging tractor beam. 
(but the NCC 1841 clips the nacelle anyway) 
RIKER: Damage report! 
CRUSHER: Casualty reports coming in from all over the ship. 
DATA: Starboard nacelle sustained a direct impact. Venting drive
plasma. 
LAFORGE: Initiating emergency core shutdown. 
RO: Inertial dampers failing. We're losing attitude control. 
RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. 
DATA: Core shutdown was unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter
containment. 
LAFORGE: We've got to eject the engine core! 
DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. 
PICARD: All hands, abandon ship! Repeat, all hands abandon 
(KaBOOM!!!!)

Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise has
entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first
Starfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region.
