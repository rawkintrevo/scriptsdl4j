[Casino]

WORF: Phasers are totally ineffective on all
surfaces. 
DATA: Sir, our options appear quite limited. 
RIKER: We don't have any. If we're going to get out of here, we're
going to have to do it on our own. I'm going to get some answers out of
that desk clerk. 
[Lobby]

(The bellboy has taken a gun from a drawer) 
CLERK: Are you crazy? 
BELLBOY: Wrong. I'm finally getting some smarts. 
CLERK: You think you're going to scare Mickey D with that gun? 
BELLBOY: I'm going to make him leave Rita alone. 
CLERK: Kid, she's a big girl, and she's Mickey D's girl. 
BELLBOY: Not any more. Not after tonight. 
CLERK: Look, kid. I like you. I don't want to see you get hurt,
especially over some dame 
BELLBOY: Don't call her that. You'll see. You'll see how tough Mickey D
is. He's nothing. 
RIKER: I want some answers. 
CLERK: I'm sure the concierge will be delighted 
RIKER: We would like to get out of here. Now. 
CLERK: The Royale's exits are clearly marked. 
RIKER: That's not good enough. 
CLERK: If you have a complaint about the service you've received during
your stay here, you can always take it up with the manager. 
RIKER: Fine. I'd like to see him, immediately. 
CLERK: I'm afraid the manager is very busy. 
(The desk clerk leaves) 
PICARD [OC]: (faint) Riker, can you read me? 
RIKER: Yes.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: There's a good deal of interference,
but you are getting through. 
PICARD: Number One, why haven't you left that building? 
[Lobby]

RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trapped
here. We're in no immediate danger

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: But I am concerned. 
PICARD: Something about your location is interfering with
communication. We are working on the problem. 
RIKER [OC]: Standing by, sir. 
WESLEY: Captain, these frequencies are unstable. 
PICARD: Then find others. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: What is going on down there?

[Lobby]

DATA: Commander, I am picking up something most
unusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be human
DNA. 
RIKER: Where? 
DATA: Thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us. 
WORF: Perhaps those turbolifts could take us there. 
(Of course, the doors don't open automatically for them) 
WORF: Seems to be malfunctioning. 
(Data presses the button)

[Hotel corridor]

DATA: The reading I received is from behind this
door, sir. 
(Riker knocks, then Worf opens the door and they enter)
