further.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I guess it noticed what we're doing.

changing colour. 
PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Just a little more time. Leah, nudge it
down even further, toward point oh two.

LEAH [OC]: Point oh eight.

[Engineering]

LEAH: Oh five, oh three. 
[Bridge]

LEAH [OC]: Now at point oh two centimetres.
