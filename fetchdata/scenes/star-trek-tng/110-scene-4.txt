(Wesley enters, in his new acting Ensign uniform.
It looks awful) 
WESLEY: Commander, you'll soon be getting an intruder alert.
RIKER: What? Wesley, if you've something to report. 
WESLEY: If you'll scan heading four four mark one six three,
Lieutenant, you'll find 
TASHA: Intruder alert, sir. 
LAFORGE: I've got something, sir. 
WESLEY: It's an old style starship, Constellation Class, heading this
way under impulse power, sir. 
(Picard enters) 
RIKER: Says who? 
PICARD: Ensign, answer the First Officer's question. 
WESLEY: Says the long distance sensors, sir. I was in Engineering,
playing around with boosting sensor output. 
DATA: Boosting it? How? (catches Picard's eye) We will discuss this
later. 
LAFORGE: I read it now, sir, as a Constellation class starship heading
this way under impulse power. Sending no call letters, sir. 
PICARD: The correct procedure, 
RIKER: What's wrong, sir? 
PICARD: Oh, it's nothing. It's just a, just a mild headache. The
correct procedure, Ensign, would have been to signal the Bridge of your
finding immediately. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Bringing it here personally, perhaps with the idea of being on
hand for the Ferengi beam over, might have imperiled this vessel had it
been something hostile approaching. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
WORF: We are receiving no signal at all from the approaching starship,
sir. 
DATA: Time, sir. 
PICARD: Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam over. Do you see any problems
connected with this old starship coming in, Number One? 
RIKER: Suggest it would be safer, sir, to have the Ferengi here
whatever happenings. 
PICARD: Concur. Stand by. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
(The Ferengi transporter is a curved effect, instead of vertical. Three
big-eared little men appear in front of the viewscreen) 
PICARD: Welcome you in peace to the Enterprise, DaiMon Bok. 
BOK: It is our pleasure, Captain Picard. Might I introduce my First
Officer, Kazago, and my Second, Rata? 
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. Second in
command, Data. Counsellor Troi. 
BOK: We have heard that you use females. Clothed females. Most
interesting. 
RIKER: They are that, sir. 
KAZAGO: And the android was mentioned too. What is its price? We should
like to purchase it. 
PICARD: He is not for sale. Commander Data is, um, is, um 
RIKER: Is second-hand merchandise. You wouldn't want him. 
DATA: Second-hand, sir? Oh, of course. A human joke. 
TASHA: Excuse, Captain, but the unidentified starship is coming in.
Still no signal at all. 
BOK: Think nothing of it. It is under our control. 
PICARD: One of our starships under your control? 
BOK: Do not be alarmed, Captain. It is a gift from us. With which we
honour the Hero of Maxia. 
PICARD: Who? 
BOK: Why you, Picard, of course. Do you not remember the Battle of
Maxia? 
PICARD: I'm sorry, I do not remember it, DaiMon Bok. Data? 
DATA: Captain, he may refer to an incident which occurred nine years
ago in the Maxia Zeta star system, in which an unidentified starship 
BOK: Unidentified? That fine vessel was Ferengi. 
DATA: Which you destroyed, sir. 
PICARD: The Battle of Maxia. I've never heard it referred to so
dramatically before. My sincere regrets, Bok, but that vessel refused
to identify itself. It simply attacked us. We defended ourselves. 
BOK: Such mistakes happen in space. 
DATA: Hardly a mistake, sir. Your report shows that it deliberately
attacked. 
TASHA: Do you want the arriving vessel on main viewer, sir? It is only
a thousand kilometres away now. 
BOK: Put it on your viewer. 
PICARD: Main viewer. 
BOK: There is no one aboard it. 
RATA: The log should be downloaded into the Enterprise's records. At a
price. 
BOK: No price! 
KAZAGO: No price? 
PICARD: For what purpose? What (clutches his head in pain) 
TROI: I just felt something too, Captain. 
BOK: Perhaps it is his conscience? 
RIKER: Bridge to Sickbay. 
PICARD: No, no. I'm fine 
TROI: It felt as if it were something from your past. 
PICARD: It's right. I'm fine. What is this all about? 
BOK: It is about the battle I mentioned, Captain. A gift, in honour of
that occasion. Look at that ship closely. 
PICARD: Magnify please, Lieutenant La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Why, it's the Stargazer. It's my old ship. How did you find it?

BOK: It was a derelict, adrift in space on the far side of this star
system. How it got there is none of my business, Captain. But now, that
vessel is yours, if you wish to have it. 
KAZAGO: We are not selling it to him? 
BOK: Consider it an act of friendship. 
RATA: At no cost? Oh, ugly. Very ugly.

Captain's log, supplemental. Bok and his officers
have returned to their vessel, inviting us now to officially take
possession of the Stargazer. 
[Sickbay]

(This time, Picard is on a full bio-bed) 
CRUSHER: Like before? 
PICARD: No. It hit with more impact. 
TROI: Hit? I'm sorry, but anything could be important. 
CRUSHER: You said you felt something yourself. 
TROI: I believe so. Like a thought, but rather mechanical in nature. 
PICARD: Are you sure it wasn't one of my thoughts? At that moment, I
was remembering being at the helm of the Stargazer. A manoeuvre was
being made. We were hit. Something's burning. I can smell smoke. Can
you smell it? 
CRUSHER: There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: That was just part of my memory. 
TROI: Memory or nightmare? 
(Riker enters) 
PICARD: Well, it was strong, whatever it was. Are you ready, Number
One. 
RIKER: Staff's waiting, if Doctor Crusher approves. 
CRUSHER: I'll do better than that. I'll go along.
