RIKER PICARD ELINE OGAWA CRUSHER DATA MERIBOR MAN

[Living room]

(the little girl runs to Eline, who is holding a
baby) 
ELINE: Meribor, this is your brother's ceremony. Don't fidget now. 
PICARD: We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. But
now his memory will live on in his namesake. 
ELINE: We name you Batai, in his honour. 
PICARD: And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you.
Please, help yourselves to something to eat. 
MAN: Congratulations, Kamin. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
ELINE: It seems like only yesterday we had Meribor's naming ceremony.
Go on. 
PICARD: I remember. I was so nervous I was afraid that I would drop
her. Now look at the little lady. 
ELINE: She's no lady. Tromping through the hills with you all day,
digging up those soil samples you insist upon collecting. No, she's her
father's daughter. 
PICARD: I would have believed I didn't need children to complete my
life. Now I couldn't imagine life without them. 
ELINE: Kamin, what is it? 
(Picard collapses) 
ELINE: Get the doctor. Hurry!

[Bridge]

OGAWA: His respiratory system's in spasm. Pulse is
irregular and weakening. 
CRUSHER: I'm losing him! 
OGAWA: I'm getting massive somatophysical failure. 
CRUSHER: Two cc's delactovine. 
RIKER: Data, get that beam back. 
OGAWA: There are severe fluctuations in the isocortex. Synaptic
responses are failing. 
CRUSHER: Begin full cardiac induction. 
OGAWA: Blood pressure is dropping rapidly. Seventy over twenty. 
CRUSHER: Data, you've got to re-establish that beam. 
DATA: I am attempting to do so, Doctor. 
OGAWA: Losing response in the isocortex. 
CRUSHER: Cortical stimulators. Start at ten percent. 
DATA: The beam is fully restored, Doctor. 
OGAWA: Blood pressure up to ninety over forty and rising. 
CRUSHER: Isocortical functions are stabilising. Vital signs are
approaching normal.

[Courtyard]

PICARD: Meribor? 
MERIBOR: (a fine young woman) Happy day, father. 
PICARD: Hey, that's my hobby. Find your own. 
MERIBOR: You're the one who taught me. Don't complain if you've turned
me into a scientist. 
PICARD: And what has the scientist been up to today? 
MERIBOR: Analysing soil samples. There isn't any anaerobic bacteria.
The soil is dead. This isn't just a very long drought, is it, Father? I
have entries in my log that go back ten years. You have data preceding
that for fifteen years. You've reached the same conclusion, I know you
have. 
PICARD: I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn't
function by conjecture. 
MERIBOR: A good scientist functions by hypothesising and then proving
or disproving that hypothesis. That's what I did. 
PICARD: Hey, why don't you spend more time with that young fellow
Dannick? 
MERIBOR: You are changing the subject. 
PICARD: No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you.

MERIBOR: You've taught me to pursue the truth, no matter how painful it
is. It's too late to back off now. This planet is dying. 
PICARD: Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns.
Games and toys and clothes. 
MERIBOR: I don't think you mean that. 
PICARD: No, I don't. It just saddens me to see you burdened with the
knowledge things you can't change. 
MERIBOR: Father, I think I should marry Dannick sooner rather than
later, don't you? 
PICARD: Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the most
precious time. Now will never come again. 
MERIBOR: I love you, Father.
