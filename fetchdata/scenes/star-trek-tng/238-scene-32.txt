RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD MORIARTY COUNTESS

[Bridge]

RIKER: Where is Captain Picard? What have you done
with Lieutenant Barclay and Commander Data? 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: They're safe, for now. 
RIKER: Release control of this ship. 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid I can't do that. 
RIKER: What do you want? 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: I only want what you have the luxury of
taking for granted. Freedom. I want to leave this holodeck. 
RIKER: I think you know that's impossible. 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: Your crewmates here in my little ship in a
bottle, seem a bit more optimistic. 
RIKER: Oh? 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: They attempted to use your transporter device
to remove a simulated object from the holodeck. 
LAFORGE: If they tried it, they must have thought they were on to
something. 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: Their attempt was futile because their
transporter was a facsimile. I expect more from you. 
LAFORGE: Just because our transporter is real doesn't mean it's going
to work. 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: I sense a distressing lack of enthusiasm on
your parts. 
WORF: Sir, warp core temperature is rising. Approaching critical
levels. 
MORIARTY [on viewscreen]: I have nothing to lose, Commander. 
RIKER: Mister La Forge, start working on the problem. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
WORF: Core temperature dropping. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Computer, resume programme.

[221b Baker Street]

COUNTESS: Hello. Have we met? 
PICARD: Captain Jean-Luc Picard. 
COUNTESS: James has told me all about you. I am Regina, Countess
Bartholomew. Do sit down. May I offer you some tea, Captain? 
PICARD: Thank you, no. I've come here to prevail upon your intelligence
and your insight. 
COUNTESS: But not apparently my humility. 
PICARD: Credit where credit is due, madam. I can see you are a woman
not only of breeding, but of wit and sagacity. 
COUNTESS: And you, sir, are a man of charm and guile. You remind me of
Viscount Oglethorpe. He was a man could bewitch any woman who breathed.

PICARD: And do you suspect that that is my intent? 
COUNTESS: I cannot be certain of your intent, but I am certain that
you're the kind of man who usually gets exactly what he wants. 
PICARD: What does a woman like you see in a man like Moriarty? 
COUNTESS: He's an exciting man, Captain. He's brilliant, incisive, he's
ruthless. He has an almost irresistible appeal. 
PICARD: He's also an arch-criminal. 
COUNTESS: Only because he was written like that. I see him entirely
differently, Captain, he is not a villain. 
PICARD: So it's your desire to leave the holodeck to be with him. 
COUNTESS: More than anything. Can you help us? 
PICARD: Yes, I can. We have learned that if we uncouple the
transporter's Heisenberg Compensators and allow them to re-scramble
randomly, we can beam a holodeck object or a person off the grid with
all of the cohesion of conventional matter. 
COUNTESS: Oh! Oh, that's splendid. I must tell James. 
PICARD: No, please. Wait. I have brought you this information because I
think you are someone who will listen to a reasonable proposition.
Someone whose mind is open to compromise. 
COUNTESS: Yes? 
PICARD: My ship is in danger. It is imperative that I regain
navigational control. I want you to persuade Professor Moriarty to
return the voice command to me, or I will not modify the transporter. 
COUNTESS: I see. 
PICARD: Now, once I have regained voice command, I will transport you
from the holodeck. 
COUNTESS: Forgive me, Captain, but that does sound more like a threat
than a compromise. 
PICARD: Countess, you must understand that I am responsible for more
than one thousand lives. 
COUNTESS: I will do what I can.

[Bridge]

(the two planets are merging) 
LAFORGE: The gravity well is beginning to intensify. 
RIKER: Are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in? 
LAFORGE: It's too soon to tell. 
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF [OC]: Worf here, sir. 
RIKER: How are you doing?

[Corridor]

WORF: There are force fields blocking our access to
the holodeck. It will take time to disable them. 
RIKER [OC]: Keep trying. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[221b Baker Street]

MORIARTY: Think, my dear. You're certain he said
they had to uncouple the Heisenberg
compensators? 
COUNTESS: Yes, James, I'm quite certain. But he won't do it unless you
return control of the ship to him. 
MORIARTY: I have them running around like rats in a maze. 
COUNTESS: What harm would there be in accepting his proposition? 
MORIARTY: My dear, you are as brilliant as you are beautiful.
Nonetheless, there are things you do not understand. Now, please, you
must let me handle this. Computer, arch. Moriarty to Commander Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
MORIARTY: Commander Riker, a pleasure as always. 
RIKER [on monitor]: I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship is
falling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty five
minutes, holodeck and all. 
MORIARTY: Then I'm sure you'll be motivated to listen to me very, very
carefully. I want to talk to you about uncoupling the
Heisenberg compensators. 
(after the break) 
COUNTESS: James, when we go leave here, where exactly are we going? 
MORIARTY: Everywhere, my darling. There are more worlds in the heavens
than there are grains of sand on a shoreline. 
COUNTESS: I wish I could take my books. I will be so lost without them.

MORIARTY: I'll get you more. Don't worry. I promise you, you'll want
for nothing. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Moriarty. 
MORIARTY: It's time. Yes, Commander? 
RIKER [OC]: We're ready. 
MORIARTY: As are we. 
RIKER [on monitor]: Step inside the transport area.
MORIARTY: We're ready here. 
RIKER [OC]: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Welcome aboard. 
MORIARTY: May I present Regina, the Countess Bartholomew. 
RIKER: Countess. 
COUNTESS: Commander. 
RIKER: You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities given the
circumstances. 
MORIARTY: Ah, yes. I expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your
vessel. 
RIKER: Please. 
MORIARTY: I'm afraid that won't be possible just yet. 
RIKER: We had an agreement. 
MORIARTY: And I intend to honour it. I have no desire to see your
vessel destroyed. Just give me one of your shuttlecraft, and allow us
to leave in peace. 
RIKER: We don't have time for this. You release the command codes and
we'll talk. 
MORIARTY: I will not release your vessel until I am looking at it
through a shuttlecraft window.

[Shuttlebay]

RIKER: Everything has been programmed to operate on
voice command. you just tell the computer where you want to go. 
MORIARTY: Excellent. 
RIKER: I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabited
planet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is your
business. 
MORIARTY: Please tell your Captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I
do wish I could see his face when he realises where he's been the last
several hours. 
RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger. 
MORIARTY: Don't worry, Commander. You'll soon have control of your
ship. 
COUNTESS: Goodbye, Commander. Thank you for everything. 
MORIARTY: Computer, prepare to depart. 
RIKER: Open shuttlebay doors.
