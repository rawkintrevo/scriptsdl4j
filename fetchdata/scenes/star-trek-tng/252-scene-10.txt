[Bridge]

RIKER: Confirmed. The MS One colony is under
attack. 
PICARD: Doesn't it seem strange to you that there have been two Borg
attacks and the Enterprise has been the nearest ship in both instances?

DATA: Captain, we are nearing the MS system. 
WORF: I have located the Borg ship. It is heading away from the colony.

PICARD: Take us out of warp near that ship. 
RIKER: Stand by to lock phasers on target. 
WORF: Within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(it is the same ship) 
PICARD: Lay in an intercept course, full impulse. Lock phasers. 
WORF: We are closing, sir. Within phaser range in thirty seconds. 
DATA: Sensors are detecting a subspace distortion forming directly
ahead of the Borg ship. 
PICARD: They're not going to get away with it this time. Picard to
Engineering. Transfer auxiliary and emergency power to the impulse
engines. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Acknowledged. 
DATA: Impulse engines are now at one hundred twenty five percent. 
WORF: Within phaser range in ten seconds. 
(the Borg ship vanishes in a flash of white light and Enterprise
shakes) 
DATA: We appear to be caught in some kind of energy matrix. 
RIKER: All engines back full. 
WORF: Shields failing. 
DATA: We are being pulled inside. 
(and Enterprise disappears into a Whovian/Stargate style wormhole
effect) 
WORF: Inertial dampers failing. 
DATA: Main power is offline. I am switching to backups. 
PICARD: Picard to Engineering, can we transfer auxiliary power to the
warp nacelles? Try to break us out by using the 
(normal space) 
DATA: We have returned to normal space. Navigational systems are still
offline. I will attempt to make a celestial fix using secondary
systems. 
WORF: Captain, the Borg ship is directly ahead. It is coming about. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: Shields down to sixteen percent. 
(the Borg fire an energy bolt, and two drones materialise on the
Bridge) 
GUEST0: Get down! 
(Franklin shoots at the Borg and misses, and gets shot himself. Worf
shoots both Borg as one kept his back to him) 
RIKER: Franklin's dead, sir. 
PICARD: Is everyone else all right? 
WORF: Aye, sir. Security reports no other intruders aboard. Captain,
the Borg ship is gone. Sensor logs indicate they entered the distortion
field thirty seconds ago. 
PICARD: They beamed aboard as a diversion to give their ship time to
escape. 
RIKER: This is another change in the Borg behaviour. They left their
dead instead of vapourising them. 
DATA: Captain, this one is still alive.
