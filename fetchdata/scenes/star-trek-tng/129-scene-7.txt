[Bridge]

WORF: What was that? 
RIKER: Lieutenant? 
WORF: An odd surge of power, sir. It's gone now.

[Street]

(No hawkers, a barking dog, drunken sailors, and
the man puts his top hat back on) 
PULASKI: Interesting. The same London but slightly different. 
WHORE: Is something wrong, Professor? 
MORIARTY: I, I feel like a new man. That dark fellow there used the
word arch, and then. I wonder? Arch. 
(The computer arch appears for him) 
MORIARTY: What have we here? 
COMPUTER: Computer standing by. 
MORIARTY: What are you? 
COMPUTER: If you refer to the arch you ordered, it provides computer
control. Do you wish to input any commands? 
MORIARTY: Not at this time. 
(The arch disappears) 
WHORE: It's dark magic, Moriarty. 
MORIARTY: The best kind, I'm sure. But I need information. 
(Further along the street) 
LAFORGE: Data, I mean, Holmes old boy, what are we looking for? 
DATA: For whatever finds us, my dear Watson. 
(A scream. They run back to discover a shoe on the pavement.) 
DATA: She has been abducted. 
LAFORGE: Who has? 
DATA: The good Doctor. 
LAFORGE: I think she's hiding. She's going to lead you on a wild goose
chase and then recount the story to everyone between here and Alpha
Centauri. 
DATA: Watson, the doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall.
The other is shorter, left handed, and is employed in a laboratory. 
LAFORGE: And how do you know that? 
DATA: One set of footfalls are widely spaced. The other is evenly
spaced, closer together. Further, on the ground you can see the
swirling scrapes made by his left shoe as he twists behind, presumably
to see if he is being followed. Left footed means left handed. The dark
colouring of the scrapes are the leavings of natural rubber, a type of
non-conductive soles used by researchers experimenting with
electricity. Finally, there can be no argument, the game is afoot!
Come, Watson!
