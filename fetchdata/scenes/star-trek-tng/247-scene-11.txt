[Asylum cell]

(a columnar device has been brought into the cell) 
GUEST4: Close your eyes. Try to relax. Clear your mind. 
(the device sends out a beam which scans Riker's face) 
GUEST4: Now, think back to before you came to the hospital. But don't
try to remember specific incidents. Concentrate on how you felt. 
RIKER: I was afraid. 
(a second beam projects an image) 
TROI: Terrified. 
RIKER: She was on the ship with me. 
GUEST4: That's because she represents an aspect of your personality, and
there are many parts of you that still believe you're on that starship.

RIKER: Why her? 
GUEST4: I asked you to get in touch with your feelings, and this is the
part of you that responded. Talk to her about how you felt before you
came here. 
RIKER: You said I was terrified. Of what? 
TROI: I was in a dark place. Cold. Frightened. Someone was there. 
RIKER: Who? 
TROI: I felt threatened by them. Trapped 
GUEST4: You're doing very well. Now let's try to find out how you
responded to these feelings. Try to focus on your actions. You felt
trapped. What did you do? 
WORF: I was angry. They were attacking me. I fought back. 
TROI: I felt pain. 
WORF: I was injured. 
TROI: I began to panic. 
WORF: There was a struggle and I 
RIKER: You what? What happened? 
GUEST4: Try to associate your actions and emotions with logical
thoughts. What do you think caused you to act and feel this way? 
PICARD: It was cold and dark because I was outdoors at night. I was in
a narrow place. I was walking through an alley. 
TROI: I felt threatened. 
WORF: I was being watched. 
PICARD: Someone must have followed me into the alley. That's why I
started to walk faster. Someone grabbed me from behind. 
TROI: I panicked. 
WORF: I tried to fight them off. 
RIKER: How many of them were there? 
PICARD: Three. Humanoid. I only saw the face of one of them. 
RIKER: What did he look like? 
(and the spooky alien is sitting next to Riker) 
RIKER: I saw him on the ship too. I also saw him here in the hospital,
but I don't know who he is. 
GUEST4: That's Mister Suna, the hospital Administrator. You met him when
you first arrived here. 
RIKER: What part of me does he represent? 
GUEST4: I don't know. 
TROI: Don't believe this, Will. None of it's real. You're still with us
on the Enterprise. 
RIKER: Doctor? 
PICARD: We're your colleagues. You can trust us. Everything will be all
right 
GUEST4: Do you have anything to say to them? 
RIKER: You're all delusions. 
WORF: Do not listen to him, Commander. He is trying to trick you. You
are in danger here. Let us help you. 
TROI: Listen to me, Will. In all the years we've known each other, have
I ever lied to you? 
RIKER: No, please. Leave me alone! 
PICARD: Will, please. 
RIKER: No! 
(the device removes the images) 
GUEST4: You've taken a big step today. You've finally turned your back
on those delusions and all that they represent to you. We'll continue
later.
