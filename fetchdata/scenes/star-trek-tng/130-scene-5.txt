[Corridor]

OKONA: Have you ever been cold? 
DATA: No. 
OKONA: Warm, then? 
DATA: No. 
OKONA: What about drunk? Ever do that? 
DATA: From alcohol? That is not possible for me, sir. 
OKONA: Pity. What about love? 
DATA: The act or the emotion? 
OKONA: They're both the same. 
DATA: I believe that statement to be inaccurate, sir. 
OKONA: Maybe. Life is like loading twice your cargo weight onto your
spacecraft. If it's canaries and you can keep half of them flying all
the time, you're all right. 
DATA: I doubt that statement is entirely accurate either, sir. 
OKONA: Accurate? That was a joke I just told you. 
DATA: I do not understand. 
OKONA: You don't know what a joke is? 
DATA: Of course I do. It is a witticism, a gag, a bon mot, a
fluctuation of words concluding with a trick ending. 
OKONA: That's the dictionary meaning. I'm talking about humour, fun. Do
you know what funny is? (blank) Where is eight oh six? 
DATA: Right over there, sir. Why? 
OKONA: You probably wouldn't understand that either. 
(The door opens to reveal Robinson in a slinky dress, waiting for
Okona) 
ROBINSON: Hello, there. 
[Engineering]

RIKER: Status on the repair? 
LAFORGE: Working on it. 
WESLEY: Commander, what do you think of Captain Okona? 
RIKER: Well, Okona is an interesting man, certainly. We've seen how he
handles his ship. Apparently he knows how to handle people as well. 
WESLEY: Then why does he work alone? 
RIKER: He's a man who lives his life by his own rules. He does what he
does by choice. By his choice. Someday you'll make yours. 
WESLEY: I already have.
