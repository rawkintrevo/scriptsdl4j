[Corridor]

RIKER: Beverly? 
CRUSHER: Yes? 
RIKER: We've arranged for a shuttle to take you to Starbase twenty
three. You can leave the ship at oh seven hundred hours tomorrow. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. 
RIKER: About everything that's going on. I'm sorry. I'm sure it will
all work out. 
CRUSHER: Yes, of course. 
RIKER: You know the inquiry's just a formality, and Captain Picard will
do everything he can for you. 
CRUSHER: I'm sure that'll help. 
RIKER: But if you do anything foolish before that inquiry. it's not
going to look good for you. 
CRUSHER: I don't know what you mean. 
RIKER: I think you do know what I mean. The best thing for you to do
right now is go to your quarters and read a good book. If you do
anything to make the situation any worse it's going to be that much
harder on you. 
CRUSHER: Thank you, Commander. Your concern is noted. 
RIKER: Beverly. I'm saying this to you as a friend. 
CRUSHER: Yes, Will, I know. But, as a friend, please try to understand.
I can't quit now and I don't want you to become involved in this. 
[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Computer, access ship's medical logs and
download current autopsy files. 
COMPUTER: Autopsy files are restricted to active medical personnel
only. Access denied. 
CRUSHER: Damn. 
OGAWA: Doctor Crusher? What do you need the autopsy files for? 
CRUSHER: Don't worry. I know I'm not supposed to be here. I'll go. 
OGAWA: Computer, access autopsy files. 
OGAWA: I assume you'll need the files on Doctor Reyga and Jo'Bril? 
CRUSHER: Alyssa. 
OGAWA: I can see how important this is to you. 
CRUSHER: I don't want you to get involved in this. 
OGAWA: Is that an order, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
OGAWA: Too bad you're not my boss now. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. 
OGAWA: So what do we do now? 
CRUSHER: First of all, I want to review Jo'Bril's physiology records.
Then I want to take another look at the body. I want to see if there's
any tetryon traces. 
OGAWA: Let's do it.

(they get Jo'Bril out of storage) 
CRUSHER: We need to run a tissue scan at the molecular level. Calibrate
the scanner to pick up tetryon particles. 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. Re-calibration complete. 
CRUSHER: Activate the scan. 
OGAWA: Nothing. 
CRUSHER: Let's do it again. Use the enhanced resolution mode to boost
the sensitivity. 
OGAWA: There's something in the subdermal tissue. 
CRUSHER: Narrow the scan field. Tetryon traces. Someone did sabotage
the shield. 
OGAWA: That's a possibility, but this is very circumstantial evidence. 
CRUSHER: There's only one way to know for certain.
