(La Forge beams in and is immediately crowded by
four very big guys. Think Vogons without the green skin) 
LAFORGE: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, it's okay. I'm here to help. 
GREBNEDLOG: We are far from home. 
LAFORGE: Who's in charge of Engineering? 
GREBNEDLOG: My friend. His name is Reginod. 
LAFORGE: Think I could meet him? 
GREBNEDLOG: He is Reginod. 
LAFORGE: Yes, I think you mentioned that. 
REGINOD: We look for things. 
LAFORGE: So I've heard. 
GREBNEDLOG: Can you make our ship go? 
LAFORGE: Yes, I think so. 
GREBNEDLOG: We look for things to make us go. 
LAFORGE: Fellas, why don't you show me where your guidance system is,
okay? Excuse me.
REGINOD: He is smart.

(The Bridge crew are watching everything on the
viewscreen) 
TROI: Commander? Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship? 
RIKER: Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks. 
DATA: How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine
curiosity. 
TROI: Commander. Those aliens. What they feel is not helplessness.
Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger, great danger. 
RIKER: Can you be more specific, Counsellor? 
TROI: It's not our help they want. 
RIKER: Well, our help is all they're going to get. They can't force us
into anything, can they? 
TROI: You think they're weak. 
RIKER: Look at them. They're certainly not Jarada or Romulans. 
DATA: Our Betazoid Counsellor is often aware of things beyond our
perceptive abilities.

[Shuttlecraft]

PICARD: Van Doren's technique has been perfected to
two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortality
rate. Two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Those are pretty good odds. 
PICARD: Just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innards
becoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. 
WESLEY: Of course not, sir. Why didn't you just have Doctor Pulaski
perform the operation? I'm sure you could've trusted her to keep it
quiet. 
PICARD: Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shall
we?
