RIKER LAFORGE WORF RHODES BOK PICARD DATA

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, sensors are detecting a subspace carrier
wave headed for the ship. Its signature is consistent with Bok's
transporter. 
RIKER: See if you can trace and locate Bok's ship. Geordi, are you
ready down there? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I've got a signal lock on Jason. 
RIKER: Riker to Picard. 
[Crusher's office]

PICARD: Picard here. 
RIKER [OC]: Bok is trying to use his transporter.

[Bridge]

DATA: The transporter beam is focusing on deck
nine, section four. 
RIKER: Jason's quarters. 
LAFORGE [OC]: I'm on it, Commander.
RHODES [OC]: Security to Bridge. Bok is 
[Jason's quarters]

RHODES: Beaming Jason off the ship.

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: Initiating transport now. I'm losing his
signal. 
(Picard enters) 
LAFORGE: Bok is re-establishing his lock on him. 
(Jason is beamed away)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Have you been able to locate Bok's ship? 
DATA: No, sir. The subspace signature left by his transporter is
decaying more rapidly than predicted. It may not be possible to trace
it. 
WORF: Captain, another probe has materialised five hundred kilometres
to starboard. It is sending a transmission. 
PICARD: Put it on screen. 
BOK [on viewscreen]: This is a very special day, Picard. Fifteen years
ago you took my son away from me. Today, I will take your son away from
you. It will be our anniversary. I wanted you to see him one last time.

(transmission ends) 
DATA: I am tracing the transporter beam Bok used to send the probe. The
ship is holding position approximately three hundred billion kilometres
from here. 
PICARD: Plot a course. Maximum warp. 
RIKER: Even at warp nine we wouldn't get there for another twenty
minutes. 
PICARD: The modifications you made to the transporter. Is there any way
we could use a subspace transport from here to get me onto Bok's ship? 
DATA: It may be possible, sir, but it would not be advisable. 
PICARD: I'll take that as a yes. You're with me.

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: There. I've aligned the field coils. 
DATA: Phase dampers are in synch. Standing by to modulate the transport
pattern. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we might be able to get you over there, but I don't
see how we're going to get you back. 
PICARD: (standing with phaser drawn) We'll deal with that when the time
comes. 
LAFORGE: Transport's going to take longer than normal. We have to shunt
your pattern through the subspace field coils. 
PICARD: Understood. 
DATA: Initiating transport sequence now.
