RIKER LAFORGE PICARD CHILTON CRUSHER DATA

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: Milk, warm, a dash of nutmeg. 
PICARD: What's this? 
CRUSHER: A prescription. A glass of warm milk and eight hours
uninterrupted sleep. 
PICARD: Beverly. 
CRUSHER: Doctor's orders. You're exhausted. Look, I don't know whether
you've slept in the past or in the future, but I'm sure you haven't
slept in the present. Now get some rest, or I'll have you relieved and
sedated. 
PICARD: Yes, sir. What? Hey, Beverly? 
CRUSHER: As a physician, it's often my job to give people unpleasant
news. To tell them that they need surgery or that they can't have
children or that they might be facing a difficult illness. 
PICARD: But you said yourself that this is only a possibility. 
CRUSHER: But you've been to the future. You know it's going to happen. 
PICARD: I prefer to look on the future as something which is not
written in stone. A lot of things can happen in twenty five years. 
(they kiss) 
CRUSHER: A lot of things can happen. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain? 
[Future - Data's library]

LAFORGE: Captain, wake up. 
PICARD: Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? 
LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone? 
PICARD: Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? 
LAFORGE: Data's arranged for us to run those tests on you in the
biometrics lab. We're ready to go if you are. 
PICARD: No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. 
LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone? Why? 
PICARD: In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of a
spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the
Neutral Zone. 
LAFORGE: Captain. 
PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be
here too and we have to find out. 
LAFORGE: Just because you've seen it in two other time frames, doesn't
mean that it's going to be here. 
PICARD: But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, I
know what we have to do! 
LAFORGE: All right. Okay. But first, there is no Neutral Zone,
remember? 
PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have
taken over the Romulan Empire. 
LAFORGE: Right now relations between us and the Klingons aren't too
cosy. 
PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. 
LAFORGE: Well, if we're going to the Devron system, we're going to need
a ship. 
PICARD: Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours.
Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. 
(later) 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, but
frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed
their borders to all Federation starships. 
PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence this
morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual
going on in the Devron system. 
PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are
faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border.
I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If she
finds out anything, I'll let you know. 
PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all I
can do. Riker out. 
DATA: Computer, restore holographic image. 
(back comes the fireplace) 
PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's
been sitting behind that desk too long. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. I guess all we can do now is wait and see
if the Yorktown finds anything. 
DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard a
medical ship. 
PICARD: Medical ship? 
DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus.
The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross the
border. 
PICARD: Yes. Yes! 
LAFORGE: So, What we need is a medical ship. 
PICARD: I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have
some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have. 
[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

(Captained by Beverly Picard) 
CRUSHER: (to Data and Geordi) Well, this is a page from the past. I
never thought I'd see either of you on a starship again. 
LAFORGE: Hello, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Geordi. 
DATA: Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Data. 
(then she goes to Picard and they can't decide whether to shake or hug)

PICARD: Let's just choose one. 
CRUSHER: All right. 
(they hug) 
PICARD: So, did you get my message? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Jean-Luc, crossing into Klingon territory. It's absurd.
But then I never could say no to you. 
PICARD: Oh. So that's why you married me. 
CRUSHER: Well now, the first order of business is to get clearance to
cross the Klingon border. 
LAFORGE: Agreed. What about Worf? 
PICARD: Yes, that's it. Worf. Yes, that's the answer. Worf will help us.
LAFORGE: Data, isn't Worf still a member of the Klingon High Council? 
DATA: I'm not sure. Information on the Klingon political structure is
hard to come by these days. However, at last report Worf was governor
of H'atoria, a small Klingon colony near the border.
CHILTON: Captain Picard? 
PICARD + CRUSHER: Yes? 
CHILTON: Captain, McKinley Station is signalling. They want to know
when we'll be docking. 
CRUSHER: Tell McKinley we've been called away on a priority mission. 
CHILTON: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: So, you kept the name. 
CRUSHER: I've prepared quarters for you on deck five. You might want to
get some rest. 
PICARD: No, I'm fine. I don't need rest. 
CRUSHER: Nell, please escort the Ambassador to his quarters. 
PICARD: Look, you are treating me as if I am an invalid. I do have a
few years left in me yet. I do not want to be led around, and I do not
want to be patronised. 
CRUSHER: You're right. I'm sorry. 
PICARD: Now, I'll go and get some rest. 
(Picard leaves) 
CRUSHER: How long since his last neurological scan? 
LAFORGE: I'm not sure, but I wouldn't try suggesting it. He says he's
not taking any more damn tests. 
CRUSHER: Do you really think he's moving through time? (silence) I'm
not sure I do either. But he's Jean-Luc Picard and if he wants to go on
one more mission, that's what we're going to do.
