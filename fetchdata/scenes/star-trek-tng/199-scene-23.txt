(a piece of bulkhead melts to reveal circuitry,
then covers over again)

[Ready room]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. I think you'd
better come out here, sir. 
PICARD: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We've reached the designated coordinates,
but the M-class planet, it's gone. 
PICARD: Are you sure there was no malfunction in the sensors? 
DATA: The lateral EM scanners register radiation levels indicative of a
class-M planet. Sir. 
(a planet pops into view) 
PICARD: Mister Data, run a full systems diagnostic. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Atmospheric decompression in Bridge Observation
Lounge. Environmental compensation sequence has been initiated. 
WORF: I am not registering a hull breach. 
PICARD: Scan for lifeforms. 
WORF: None, sir. 
DATA: Captain. Standard air pressure has been reestablished in the
Observation lounge. 
PICARD: Let's have a look. Mister Data? 
[Observation lounge]

WORF: Captain. 
(the furniture is all piled up by the window) 
WORF: I do not understand. 
RIKER: Are you picking anything up, Data? 
DATA: I detect no unusual readings along standard parameters. Curious.
The transparent aluminum alloy of this window is exhibiting a pattern
of transient electrical currents. 
PICARD: Explanation? 
DATA: I have none. The rate is characteristic of a subspace distortion,
but I am picking up no evidence of a subspace field. 
PICARD: We'll hold position while we seek an explanation for these
anomalies. Let's divert all our resources to that end.
