[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Sorry, Captain. There's too much
interference to form a warp field.

[Bridge]

COMPUTER: Warning. Radiation levels at sixty five
millirads per minute and rising. 
RIKER: Riker to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Go ahead, Commander. 
RIKER: All decks prepare for radiation protocol. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Acknowledged. Crusher out. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Radiation levels at three hundred millirads per
minute and rising. Lethal exposure in one minute. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, ready phasers. Minimum power. 
WORF: Ready. 
PICARD: Fire. 
DATA: Radiation levels dropping back to normal, Captain. Energy
patterns are breaking down, sir. The radiation signature is no longer
stable. 
(the once-colourful alien goes dark) 
DATA: Energy output is negligible, sir. Radiation patterns no longer
coherent. I believe it is dead, sir. 
PICARD: We're out here to explore, to make contact with other life
forms, to establish peaceful relations but not to interfere. And
absolutely not to destroy. And yet look what we have just done. 
TROI: Captain, everything you did was consistent with established
Starfleet procedures. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. 
DATA: Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the
life form. 
PICARD: Elaborate, Data. 
DATA: There is a new concentration of ionising radiation growing in the
centre of its body. 
PICARD: Then, perhaps it's still alive.

[La Forge's quarters]

(Geordi is laying the table for dinner) 
LAFORGE: Okay. Computer, subdued lighting. No, that's too much. I don't
want it dark, I want it cozy. 
COMPUTER: Please state your request in precise candlepower. 
LAFORGE: See, it's not a matter of precision, computer, it's a matter
of mood. Brighter than this. More. More. A little more. Hold. Right
there. Perfect. Now, some music. Maybe a little soft jazz. No, that's
not right. Let me think here. Oh, I got it! Some Brahms! A piano etude.
Nah, that's too corny. Probably everybody thinks of that. Computer,
just give me some guitar. Classical guitar. Doesn't matter who. Yes,
thank you. 
(Doorbell) 
LAFORGE: Come on in. 
(Leah enters) 
LEAH: Oh, you've changed. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. The uniforms are so formal. 
LEAH: You're less formal than any Starfleet officer I've ever met,
Commander. 
LAFORGE: Am I? I really just wanted to make you feel more comfortable. 
LEAH: I'm fine. Thank you. 
LAFORGE: I'm sorry. Come in and have a seat. Can I get you a drink? 
LEAH: No, thank you. 
LAFORGE: You sure? You know, your hair, it's different. 
LEAH: Different than a few hours ago? 
LAFORGE: No, I mean it's different than I expected. Different from your
Starfleet records. 
LEAH: Oh. Yes, I used to wear it up. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
LEAH: Why would you need to see my personnel file? 
LAFORGE: Standard procedure when guests come on board. Protocol. I
mean, it was nothing specific, actually. Just, you know. 
LEAH: Commander La Forge, if I seem to be somewhat unyielding in my
views, it's because I care so very much about my work. 
LAFORGE: Oh, I know. 
LEAH: To be honest, people find me cold, cerebral, lacking in humour. 
LAFORGE: But they're wrong, I assure you. 
LEAH: Well, I try not to be that way, but when it comes to my designs,
my engines, especially the ones on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: It's like they're your children. 
LEAH: Yes. Exactly. 
LAFORGE: So naturally you're a little possessive about them. 
LEAH: You understand that? 
LAFORGE: Yes, I do. You see, I feel the same way. 
LEAH: That's amazing. I don't think anyone has ever. Sometimes I feel
more comfortable with engine schematics than people. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe you just haven't met the right people. You hungry?
I'm hungry. Why don't I just start dinner, okay? 
LEAH: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Please, call me Geordi. 
LEAH: I'm sorry, I hope that I didn't put you to a lot of trouble but I
can't stay. 
LAFORGE: You can't? 
LEAH: I just don't think that it's appropriate. 
LAFORGE: Oh. 
LEAH: I'll meet with you at oh eight hundred tomorrow. I'm preparing a
list of discrepancies that I've identified in your modifications. I
hope, now that we've reached an understanding that you'll be prepared
to discuss them with me in a more objective fashion. 
LAFORGE: Sure. Fine. 
LEAH: Thank you. Goodnight, Commander. 
(Leah leaves) 
LAFORGE: Goodnight.
