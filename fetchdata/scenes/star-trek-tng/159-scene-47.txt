[Cargo bay]

WORF: Worf to Bridge. We have found no sign of the
intruder. But there is a missing pressure suit

[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: From cargo bay three.
PICARD: Pressure suit? 
RIKER: Could be he's planning to enter shuttlebay two from outside the
Enterprise, bypassing the security guards. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, post security guards at all emergency airlocks on
decks 
[Cargo bay]

PICARD [OC]: Thirty seven through thirty nine. 
WORF: Aye, sir. I'll also cover the photon torpedo launchers. Danar may
attempt to leave the ship that way. Worf out. 
(But Danar is hiding behind some cargo, not wearing the pressure suit.
When he hears the doors closing, he comes out and doesn't see Worf
hiding) 
WORF: Danar! You are cunning. You must have Klingon blood. But the
battle is over. 
ROGA: My battle is never over. 
WORF: Worf to Bridge. I have Danar. 
(The hidden phaser explodes, the lights go out, and Danar jumps Worf) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Explosion in Jefferies tube section T nine
five. All external sensors inoperative. 
RIKER: Go to backup systems. 
DATA: Unable to transfer control, sir.

[Cargo bay]

(Danar finally defeats Worf by toppling a lot of
cargo boxes on top of him. Then he beams himself onto the transport
ship) 
[Transport ship]

ROGA: Sit down, gentlemen.

[Cargo bay]

WORF: Worf to Bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead. 
WORF: Danar has escaped. 
[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: He used a phaser to power the cargo
transporter. Coordinates indicate he beamed aboard the Angosian
transport ship.
PICARD: Data, can you verify that? 
DATA: Negative, sir. All external sensors still nonfunctioning. 
PICARD: Then we have no way to track him. 
RIKER: That was his plan all along.

First officer's log, supplemental. We are
continuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escape
of the Angosian prisoner, Danar. He is still at large.
