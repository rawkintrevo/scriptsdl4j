unusual older fields alert minute fluctuation reading today wait

[Crusher's office]

WESLEY: Hi. 
CRUSHER: Hi. Troi stopped by a little while ago. She was wondering if
you might be willing to talk to Jeremy Aster at some point. 
WESLEY: Me? What for? 
CRUSHER: About your Dad. 
WESLEY: What am I going to tell him? 
CRUSHER: It would help him to talk with someone who's been through
this. We had each other, Wes. He doesn't have anyone to lean on right
now. And he might be more comfortable talking to someone who's not much
older than he is. 
WESLEY: Okay, I'll think about it. 
CRUSHER: Okay. 
WESLEY: Do you ever think about him, Mom? 
CRUSHER: Your father? Sure I do. 
WESLEY: Sometimes I can't even remember what his face looks like. It
scares me. 
CRUSHER: It happens to all of us, Wes. Sometimes I can't get his face
out of my mind. 
WESLEY: Today, today it's like I can see it all as clearly as if it
were yesterday. I can remember the way Dad looked when he hugged me
goodbye. Captain Picard's eyes when he came to tell us

RIKER: Data, run comparison of known phenomena. 
DATA: The pattern has no exact match in Federation records, sir. 
PICARD: Is it alive? 
DATA: A possibility. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, I'm getting an unusual magnetic flux reading
from the anti-matter containment pods. 
TROI: My God.

[Jeremy's quarters]

(Jeremy is back to his happy memory movies) 
JEREMY [OC]: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay, you've got ten seconds
more, Mom. No peeking. Come on, Patches, in here. Shh. Okay, Mom, we're
ready. 
MARLA [on monitor]: Jeremy? I'm getting closer. Jeremy, I'm going to
find you. You must be in here somewhere. 
MARLA: Jeremy!
JEREMY: Mom?

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: All systems are functioning normally.
Still, there's this fluctuation in the containment field. I can't
account for it. 
RIKER: Data, is this possibly related to the energy fields on the
planet? 
TROI: Captain 
DATA: There is a beam of highly charged particles emanating from the
planet, sir, but I cannot pinpoint the location yet. 
TROI: Captain, there's a presence on the Enterprise. 
PICARD: An alien presence? 
DATA: No intruder noted by the sensors, sir. 
TROI: There is a presence. 
RIKER: Security, all decks yellow alert. Possible intruder.
