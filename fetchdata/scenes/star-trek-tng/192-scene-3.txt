SUSANNA: And then I almost married Paul Bogrow. 
LAFORGE: Bogrow? Bogrow, now which one was he? 
SUSANNA: You remember. The one with the thin moustache. 
LAFORGE: Oh, not Bogrow. 
SUSANNA: I know. 
LAFORGE: The one who always used to drive you crazy? You always thought
he was so full of himself. 
SUSANNA: Well, I decided I had prejudged him unfairly. And then I
decided that I'd been right in the first place. 
LAFORGE: Bogrow. 
SUSANNA: What about you? 
LAFORGE: I enjoy the bachelor's life too much. 
SUSANNA: That doesn't sound like my little brother who always wanted
advice on women. 
LAFORGE: Well, obviously you were a great advisor. (pause) Well, Suz,
what do you think? 
SUSANNA: I don't know. But I'm not ashamed to tell you I'm a little
scared, you know? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I know. 
SUSANNA: Well, if anybody's going to figure this out, it'll be the
Leitjen and La Forge Show, right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
SUSANNA: We always made a good team. 
LAFORGE: A hell of a team. 
RIKER [OC]: Commander La Forge, Commander Leijten, report to the
Bridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle. 
LAFORGE: On our way, Commander.

[Bridge]

GRAHAM: (the lady at helm) Entering the Tarchannen
system, sir. 
PICARD: Slow to impulse power. Mister Worf? 
WORF: Long range sensors holding on the shuttlecraft, bearing zero one
zero, mark two seven one. 
PICARD: Hail the vessel. 
WORF: Lieutenant Hickman does not respond, sir. 
PICARD: Put a repeating message on all subspace channels. Order the
Lieutenant to come about and stand to. Make it a priority one
communiqu. 
WORF: Still no response, sir. 
GRAHAM: The craft is now within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
DATA: The shuttle's acceleration is increasing. Its trajectory is
moving directly into the planet's atmosphere. He will reach an
atmospheric interface at an altitude of two hundred and ten kilometres.

RIKER: If he stays at that speed, he'll self-destruct. 
DATA: That is correct, Commander. 
PICARD: How soon, Mister Data? 
DATA: Fifty three seconds, sir. 
PICARD: Options? 
GRAHAM: He's out of transporter range. 
LAFORGE: He's still too far away to get a positive lock with the
tractor beam, Captain. 
PICARD: Open a channel. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, listen carefully. This is Captain Picard of
the Enterprise. You are in danger. You must slow your rate of approach.

DATA: The shuttle is approaching the outer thermosphere, Captain. 
RIKER: He's panicking. 
DATA: At current rate of acceleration, the shuttle will be destroyed in
twenty eight seconds. 
DATA: Sixteen seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Hickman, you must do what I tell you. Reduce your
velocity and bring your craft to a positive pitch of twenty degrees,
now. 
DATA: The shuttle's entering the lower ionosphere, sir. 
(bang) 
WORF: Captain, sensors detect two more Federation shuttlecraft on the
planet surface. No life signs. 
PICARD: Number One, prepare your away team. 
RIKER: Worf, Data, Geordi. 
SUSANNA: I'd like to volunteer to join you, sir. 
RIKER: Commander.
