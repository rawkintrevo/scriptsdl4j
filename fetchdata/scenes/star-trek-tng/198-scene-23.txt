OBRIEN LAFORGE VAGH KELL PICARD CRUSHER

[La Forge's quarters]

(Geordi wakes from a nightmare) 
LAFORGE: La Forge to O'Brien. O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Go ahead, Commander, what can I do for you? 
LAFORGE: Nothing. Chief, I'm sorry to disturb you. I'm sorry.

[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: Hiya, Doc. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, hi. What can I do for you? 
LAFORGE: Well, I just can't seem to get any sleep. I was hoping you
could give me something. 
CRUSHER: Sit down. Let's take a look. You couldn't sleep at all? 
LAFORGE: I was restless. I kept waking up. 
CRUSHER: Would you take off your visor, please? 
LAFORGE: Sure. 
CRUSHER: Is there something on your mind? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't think so. 
CRUSHER: Well, everybody goes through these occasional bouts of
insomnia. There's probably nothing to worry about. Let's just make sure
there's nothing physically wrong. There's a minor vascular irregularity
in the visual cortex. A slight dilation of the blood vessels. It's
nothing serious. What about your visor? Has it been giving you any
problems lately? 
LAFORGE: Nothing out of the ordinary. 
CRUSHER: All the same, it might be a good idea to have it examined when
we get to Starbase thirty six next month. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
CRUSHER: In the meantime, I will get you a somnetic inducer to put by
your bed. It'll help you to sleep. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Doc. I'm sure I'll be fine.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Energise. 
(Kell, Vagh and two other Klingons beam in) 
PICARD: Governor Vagh, thank you for coming. 
VAGH: You can thank Ambassador Kell. I am here against my better
judgment. 
KELL: Captain, I think the first thing the Governor should see is the
investigation underway in the cargo bay. 
PICARD: Of course.
