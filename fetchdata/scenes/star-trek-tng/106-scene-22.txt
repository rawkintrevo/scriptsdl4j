[Bridge]

PICARD: Begin at warp one point five. 
LAFORGE: Warp one point five, sir.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: This isn't working. 
(Seen only by Wesley, the Traveller vanishes and reappears again. Then
Riker notices as Enterprise head off at totally ridiculous speed down a
StarGate wormhole effect)

[Bridge]

PICARD: All stop. 
LAFORGE: Answering all stop, Captain. 
DATA: According to the instruments, sir, our speed never exceeded warp
one point five. 
LAFORGE: All stopped, sir. 
PICARD: Yes, but where is this place? 
(Lights are dancing in a blue scene) 
DATA: Where none have gone before.

Captain's log, stardate 41263.3. Instead of
returning to our own galaxy, the Enterprise has gone forward
to a place in the universe which is uncharted and unknown. Our present
position puts us at over a billion light years from our galaxy.

PICARD: Data, you have the helm. I'll be in
Engineering. 
(Picard leaves) 
(There is a grunting sound, and Worf turns to see what looks like a
hairy pig with a horn and wicked looking spines) 
TASHA: What is it? 
WORF: A Klingon Targ! My pet. From home, but when I was a child. 
TASHA: You're telling me that's a kitty-cat? 
WORF: Yes, I suppose you could call it that. 
(The Targ vanishes, and a ginger cat lands on Tasha's console)

[Turbolift]

(The turbolift doors open, and Picard nearly steps
out - into space rushing by at warp speed. He pulls himself back in,
the doors close then open again into an ordinary corridor. He steps out
carefully)

[Bridge]

(Tasha is fondling the cat) 
TASHA: You darling, what are you doing here?

[Tunnel]

(Then she's back on her home planet, and a rape
gang is after her) 
TASHA: Now, run. This isn't a safe place at all. 
(Someone puts a hand on her shoulder)
