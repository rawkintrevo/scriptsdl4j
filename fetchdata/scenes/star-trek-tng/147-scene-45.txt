PICARD:
Set course three one mark
seven three. Present minimal
aspect. Ready warp one,
optimal spread on simulated
torpedoes.
BURKE: Captain. Romulan warship approaching fast from astern. 
PICARD: What the? 
BURKE: It came from nowhere, sir! 
PICARD: Bring us about, Ensign. Maximum shields. 
DATA: Disengage modified beams. 
PICARD: Full weapon systems. Lock on. Open a hailing frequency. 
BURKE: I can't, sir. There's nothing there. 
(Kolrami laughs as the Hathaway lands multiple hits on the Enterprise) 
PICARD: Warp three, evasive. Stand by. Disengage weapons and shields.
Re-engage modified beam. 
KOLRAMI: He's quite good. 
PICARD: He's the best. 
DATA: Computer reports simulated damage to several aft decks, sir.
Repair time, three point six days. 
BURKE: How did he do that? 
PICARD: Mister Worf must have overridden the sensor codes, played some
holographic games. Mister Data, input a new code.
Attack posture, circumvental attitude. Prepare beams for photon mode. 
BURKE: Bye, bye, Hathaway.

WORF:
Computers report heavy
damage to Enterprise.
WESLEY: They're moving off, sir. Why not go after them? 
RIKER: Because they're not through coming after us. Wesley, Geordi,
prepare to warp jump. 
LAFORGE: There are no guarantees here, sir. 
RIKER: There never are, Lieutenant. I'm going to trust your expertise.
Secure your stations. Stand by for my signal.

PICARD:
Ready photon torpedoes.
BURKE: Captain, sensors picking up a Ferengi warship closing at warp
five. 
PICARD: Did you input that new code? 
BURKE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I didn't give you enough credit. Continue the
simulation. 
(And they are hit with a real weapons blast) 
PICARD: Divert all power to shields! 
DATA: Sever modified beams. 
PICARD: Stay between the Ferengi and the Hathaway. 
DATA: Engage phasers and target. 
PICARD: Fire when ready.

NAGEL:
That's no ghost attacking
the Enterprise. That's real.
WORF: We must assist, sir. 
RIKER: With what? We have no offensive weapons.


[Bridge]


PICARD:
Where are my
weapons?
BURKE: Unavailable, sir! We cannot disengage the modified beams. The
connections have been fused. 
KOLRAMI: We must retreat! 
PICARD: Unacceptable! 
DATA: The Ferengi have broken off their attack. Drop shields. Transport
the away team aboard. 
BURKE: Transporter functions gone, sir. 
DATA: Shields reduced to one fifth intensity. 
KOLRAMI: Use their moment of indecision to escape! 
PICARD: I have forty crewmembers on board the Hathaway. 
KOLRAMI: Who should be sacrificed to save a thousand! Acceptable
tactical losses, considering the circumstances. 
PICARD: Not to me! Notify Starfleet. Priority. Hail the Ferengi on my
command. Formulate alternatives. 
KOLRAMI: As the Starfleet observer I am ordering you to withdraw! 
PICARD: I am the Captain of this vessel! Your order is nullified!
Ferengi on main viewscreen. 
(The familiar sight of Armin Shimmerman in Ferengi makeup greets us) 
PICARD: I am Jean-Luc Picard, of the Federation Starship, USS
Enterprise. Why have you attacked my vessel? 
BRACTOR [on viewscreen]: Why was your ship combative with another
Federation vessel of lesser design? Why do you now protect your former
target? What is its value to you? 
TACTICIAN [on viewscreen]: Our probes indicate you were aware of our
approach, yet took no action. 
BRACTOR [on viewscreen]: Your answers will dictate our response. 
PICARD: We have refrained from launching a counter-attack in the hope
that this can be resolved this peacefully. 
BRACTOR [on viewscreen]: Our probes indicate that you are crippled, and
the ship you protect has no weaponry, no light speed drive, and only a
scarce crew. 
TACTICIAN [on viewscreen]: This makes no sense to us. Unless it
contains something very valuable. 
BRACTOR [on viewscreen]: I am Bractor, leader of the Ferengi attack
vessel Kreechta. I shall have the secret of the other Federation ship.
Surrender it to me, and I will allow your Enterprise to leave unharmed.
You have ten of your minutes. 
BURKE: Sir, they're massing a surge of power. We're being scanned.
They've locked on. 
PICARD: Data? 
DATA: Our shields will not withstand another assault. 
KOLRAMI: Then there are no options. Retreat or die.


Captain's
log, supplemental. Due
to a miscalculation on my part, Enterprise
has been subjected a
surprise attack by the Ferengi. I
find myself with little time
to decide the fate of forty of
my crew stranded aboard the
derelict Hathaway.

PICARD:
I am open to
suggestions.
BURKE: Captain, we are now capable of launching a limited number of
photon torpedoes. 
KOLRAMI: I've already given you my advice, Captain. The Hathaway is
expendable. 
BURKE: Commander Riker is hailing, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. Number One, have you been monitoring communications?

RIKER [on viewscreen]: And Kolrami's right. You've got to save the
Enterprise. 
PICARD: That would leave you defenceless. 
RIKER: When Bractor closes in, we'll hit our warp drive and take our
chances. 
PICARD: Your what? 
RIKER: We have a limited, two-second warp capability. 
KOLRAMI: Impossible! That ship was rendered warp inactive. 
PICARD: I told you he was the best. I'd like to hear about this, Number
One, later. Right now I have to work something out with Mister Data.

DATA:
Premise. The Ferengi wish to
capture the Hathaway believing it
to be value. Therefore we
must remove the ship from
their field of interest.
KOLRAMI: And they will soon relocate it after a two second warp. 
PICARD: There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. We're all here.

RIKER:
Waiting for you to
pull another rabbit out of
your hat. 

[Observation

PICARD:
Mister Data
DATA: On the Captain's signal, we will fire four photon torpedoes
directly at the Hathaway.
