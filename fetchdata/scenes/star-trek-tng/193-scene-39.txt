WORF: Captain, I am picking up subspace distortion.

PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field
emanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in the
subspace continuum. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton field
disturbance? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, sir, I'm altering subspace in a way that's never
been conceived of before. I'm fairly certain it will allow us to travel
half-way across the galaxy in a matter of only 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, I want you to stop this experiment for now. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Captain, if you'd only allow me to show 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever it
is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I really would rather not, sir. I'm positive that you'll
be pleased with the result once I've finished showing 
WORF: Audio is disconnected. We may speak freely. 
RIKER: How soon before the ODN process is in place? 
DATA: I have been monitoring Geordi's progress. It will be operational
in seventeen minutes. 
TROI: Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. 
WORF: Sir, the subspace distortion continues to increase.

BARCLAY [OC]: Hello, Deanna. 
TROI: Reg. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry that we can't take that walk in the Arboretum. 
TROI: So am I. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn't
your intent. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Young children are sometimes frightened of the world.
That doesn't mean that their parents should let them stay in their
cribs. 
TROI: Are we children to you now? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can see so much more than you are capable of. You
should trust that. Deanna, I've always wanted to earn your respect. 
TROI: You've got it. From all of us. We don't need any more convincing.
Please, obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: You must trust me. 
TROI: How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Trust me. 
TROI: The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. 
(and the lasers speed up even more)

PICARD [OC]: Picard to La Forge. Status? 
LAFORGE: Ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
LAFORGE: Acknowledged. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Commander? 
LAFORGE: What? 
BARCLAY [OC]: You're too late.

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, we have not regained control of the
propulsion systems. The ODN bypass to the Bridge has been blocked. 
RIKER: Barclay! 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, Commander Riker? 
[Holodeck]

RIKER [OC]: Whatever it is you're doing out there,
you've got to stop it.
