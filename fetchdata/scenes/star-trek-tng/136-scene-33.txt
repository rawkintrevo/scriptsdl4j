right splendid away lack oc say said command alike

[Bridge]

PICARD: Standard orbit. 
GIBSON: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Captain, I am encountering the same interference we experienced
on Klavdia Three. 
DATA: The troposphere appears to be distorting our signals. It is
fascinating, Captain. Klavdia Three and Daled Four have almost
identical atmospheres. 
PICARD: Magnify. Times twenty. 
RIKER: How could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostile
toward human life? 
PICARD: Mister Data, do whatever is necessary to override the
interference. Let's complete our mission. 
[Wesley's quarters]

WESLEY: Come in. Salia! You shouldn't have come. 
SALIA: Do you want me to leave? 
WESLEY: I didn't say that. 
SALIA: Then you want me to stay. 
WESLEY: Does Anya know you're here? 
SALIA: That doesn't matter. 
WESLEY: I'm glad you came. I thought Anya would have kept you with her.

SALIA: I have certain rights. 
WESLEY: So in other words, you slipped out. 
SALIA: While she was asleep. I hope you didn't get in trouble from your
Captain. 
WESLEY: Oh, I haven't got in trouble yet. 
SALIA: Anya thought you would corrupt me. 
WESLEY: With my wild way of life? 
SALIA: Maybe. With the normal things people do when they like each
other. 
(Young love's first kiss, then Anya the monster is there, screeching) 
SALIA: Wesley, get out of here now. 
WESLEY: What's going on? 
SALIA: Just go, please. 
WESLEY: Security, crew quarters! 
SALIA: No! Anya, No! 
(Salia morphs into something bigger, and Wesley goes to safety. The two
women return to humanoid form) 
ANYA: You should not have disobeyed me. 
SALIA: I had to. 
ANYA: I warned you to leave her alone. 
Captain's log, stardate 42568.8. Since Anya's
powers of transformation
apparently gave her the ability to escape her
guards unnoticed, we have sealed her quarters with a forcefield that
will contain her no matter how small a form she may take. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I'm receiving an audio signal. 
PICARD: Audio on. 
VOICE [OC]: Come in Enterprise. This is Command Headquarters of Daled
Four. We have been expecting you. 
DATA: Sir, sensors indicate the communication originated from a
terawatt source on the planet. 
RIKER: That's more power than our entire ship can generate. 
DATA: It is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere. 
RIKER: Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir. 
WORF: Sir, there are beam-down coordinates encoded within the carrier
signal. 
PICARD: Splendid. 
RIKER: I'll arrange for our guests to beam down.

[Corridor]

WORF: Forcefield off. 
[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Come in. 
WORF: We have arrived. 
ANYA: Salia will be with you in just a moment. 
(Worf leaves) 
SALIA: You're not going? 
ANYA: No. My duties have been completed. I have done all that I could.
I hope it was enough. 
SALIA: You've raised me well, and I thank you for that. 
ANYA: I would not have harmed the boy, I only wanted to frighten him. 
SALIA: I know. 
ANYA: You are ready for what awaits you and you will do well. I know
that I have been hard on you, but I wanted to prepare you for anything
you might be required to do. 
SALIA: Will I ever be able to leave Daled Four? 
ANYA: Probably not. But anything is possible. 
SALIA: That's what Wes said. 
ANYA: I hope he's right. 
SALIA: Where will you go? 
ANYA: The third moon is within range of this ship's transporter, I
shall go there. It was my home before we went away. 
SALIA: I'm going to miss you. 
ANYA: I know. 
(Salia goes to the door, and it opens) 
SALIA: I am ready now. 
(Salia leaves and Worf enters) 
WORF: I will escort you to transporter room six. 
ANYA: You will be happy to see me leave. 
WORF: No. You are a worthy opponent. 
ANYA: Thank you. At heart, we are very much alike. 
WORF: Yes, we are. 
ANYA: Perhaps we shall fight again. On the same side. 
WORF: It would be an honour. Shall we go?
