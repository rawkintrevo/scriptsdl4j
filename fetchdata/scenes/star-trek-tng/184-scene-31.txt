TROI: Come in. 
(Riker enters) 
TROI: I really would rather be alone right now. 
RIKER: Too bad. 
(he pulls her towards him, and she cries in his arms) 
TROI: Is this how you handle all of your personnel problems? 
RIKER: Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or
Worf. 
TROI: Will, I don't know what to do. 
RIKER: So you resign? You walk away from all the people who care about
you? 
TROI: I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth.
Colourless. Hollow. Nothing seems real. 
RIKER: I'm real. 
TROI: No, you're not. You're a projection, with no more substance to me
than a character on the holodeck. 
RIKER: I don't believe that. 
TROI: You have no idea how frightening it is to just be here without
sensing you, without sharing your feelings. 
RIKER: That's it, isn't it? We're on equal footing now. 
TROI: What? 
RIKER: You always had an advantage. A little bit of control of every
situation. That must have been a very safe position to be in. To be
honest, I'd always thought there was something a little too
aristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. As if your human side wasn't
quite good enough for you. 
TROI: That isn't true. 
RIKER: Isn't it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Riker. 
RIKER: Go ahead, Geordi.

LAFORGE: We are ready to attempt a controlled
overload jump to warp six.

RIKER: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge.
I'll check in on you later. 
TROI: Really, you don't have to. 
RIKER: I will check in on you later.

PICARD: Mister La Forge, go to warp. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Status?

percent, Captain.
