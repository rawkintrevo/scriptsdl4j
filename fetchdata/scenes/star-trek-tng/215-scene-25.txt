[Turbolift]

(the lift jerks to a halt) 
DATA: They've trapped us. 
TROI: What deck is this? 
O'BRIEN: We're on deck ten. 
TROI: Can you move us again? 
O'BRIEN: I know how to override the bridge command. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Activate security fields decks eight through
fifteen. 
WORF: Sir, the turbolift is moving again. They're still inside. 
PICARD: Initiate emergency bulkheads in turboshaft four. 
WORF: Aye, sir. They have been stopped at deck thirteen. 
PICARD: Mister Worf. 
[Deck 13]

(But when Worf and Patricia Tallman and another
security guard get there, the turbolift is empty except for three comm.
badges on the floor)

[Deck 10 Corridor]

(The three encounter forcefields) 
TROI: Do you know how to deactivate this? 
O'BRIEN: The computer will not allow us to override an emergency
forcefield command. 
DATA: My entity's artificial substructure may be useful. 
(Data smashes a wall panel and short-circuits the forcefields)

[Bridge]

RIKER: They've broken through a security field,
deck ten, section two. 
PICARD: Security to Ten Forward. 
[Ten Forward]

(Molly is howling) 
KEIKO: Shh. Momma's here. Shh. 
(Troi, O'Brien and Data enter, brandishing their phasers) 
TROI: Everyone get down on the floor. 
KEIKO: Miles? 
O'BRIEN: On the floor! 
(Worf and his team burst in through the opposite door) 
WORF: Everyone down, now! 
(The two groups trade shots. Data shoots Pat. Troi shoots various
unarmed crewmen and civilians, before taking down Worf)
