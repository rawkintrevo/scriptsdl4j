PILOT: Commander, the Enterprise is underway. 
TORETH: Good. What is their course? 
PILOT: They're heading for us, sir. 
TORETH: What? 
PILOT: They appear to be on an intercept course. 
TORETH: What is the status of our cloaking device? Is there a
malfunction of any kind? 
PILOT: Cloaking device functioning correctly, sir. All shipboard
emissions within normal range. 
TORETH: Maintain full sensor scans. 
N'VEK: Commander. The Enterprise may simply be engaged in search
operations. 
TORETH: Perhaps.

PICARD: Where is it now, Mister Data? 
DATA: It has disappeared once again, sir. I believe it may have been
coming to a halt. 
PICARD: Stop engines. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: If this is a Romulan ship, will it stay in position until we
leave? 
DESEVE: I don't think so, sir. A Romulan Commander's instinct would be
to attack.

TORETH: Engage manoeuvring engines, forward zero
point one. Take us directly under their hull. 
PILOT: Yes, Commander. 
TROI: What are you doing? 
TORETH: It seems that the Enterprise can track us even though we are
cloaked. I intend to find out whether they can or cannot. N'Vek, ready
attack procedure. 
N'VEK: Sir, disruptors are standing by. Ready to disengage cloak. 
TROI: We cannot risk an engagement here. 
TORETH: Considering the nature of our mission, I would have preferred
to have avoided it as well. But I see no other alternative. 
TROI: What do you intend to do? 
TORETH: We will pass as close as we possibly can. If they do have the
ability to track us, they will move to avoid a collision. If they do, I
will destroy them.
