JAMESON PICARD ANNE CRUSHER KARNAS

[Ready room]

PICARD: The admiral displayed a remarkable
improvement out there, wouldn't you say? 
CRUSHER: Captain, no one recovers from Iverson's Disease. There is no
known cure, and there are no cases where it has gone into remission. I
have never heard of any therapy that would produce results like that. 
PICARD: Then how do you account for it? 
CRUSHER: I can't. All I can tell you is that the Admiral has been
confined to his support chair for the last four years by the effects of
Iverson's. By all the medical facts we know, he should never have
walked again. 
PICARD: I want you to look into it, Doctor. Thoroughly. 
CRUSHER: Yes, sir.

[Jameson's quarters]

KARNAS [on monitor]: The terrorists have given you
six Earth days to bring him here, or the hostages will die. 
ANNE: I don't know how much more information you think you can get from
that tape. (Jameson stands up) Mark! My God, what's happened? 
JAMESON: It's the new therapy I'm taking. It's working, Annie. 
(His hair is sleeker and thicker too. And blond now) 
ANNE: Oh, darling! 
(She kisses him, but when he responds amorously)
ANNE: Mark? 
JAMESON: I told you I just needed to get back into space again. 
ANNE: You really are looking much better. 
JAMESON: It's the new treatment. 
ANNE: No. Come here. 
JAMESON: I hope you're heading for the bedroom. 
ANNE: You stop it. 
(She brings him to a mirror and puts the light on) 
ANNE: Darling, you look like you looked twenty years ago. 
JAMESON: You're flatter me. 
ANNE: Now you tell me what the hell is going on? 
JAMESON: I don't know (collapses in pain) 
ANNE: Sickbay! Medical emergency in the Admiral's quarters!
