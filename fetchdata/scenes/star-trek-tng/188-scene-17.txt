[Flashback - Bridge]

DATA: Computer, engage emergency plan zed zed
alpha. 
COMPUTER: Automatic defense procedures initiated. Energy field strength
increasing. Warning, shield penetration seventeen percent. 
DATA: Computer, begin random fluctuation of shield frequency and
modulation. 
COMPUTER: Executed. 
DATA [OC]: With the Enterprise temporarily protected, I revived the
crew. 
DATA: Computer, release compound ADTH into the airflow system, five
parts per million. 
COMPUTER: Acknowledged. Initiating compound release now. 
(and they wake up) 
PICARD: Status, Data. 
DATA: The energy field is attempting to match shield frequencies, sir. 
PICARD: Options, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I do not recommend weapons at this range, Captain. 
PICARD: Can we go to warp? 
DATA: Negative, sir. The field is also acting as a tractor beam. 
(and the lights go down) 
COMPUTER: Warning. Shields have been penetrated. 
WORF: All systems are frozen, Captain. 
DATA [OC]: The Paxans can manipulate energy structures on many levels.
They took control of Counsellor Troi's body to communicate with us. 
(lights back up) 
WORF: Captain! 
(Worf dashes over with a phaser. Troi grabs his wrist and throws him
across the Bridge. That's how his wrist got broken) 
PICARD: No, stop, everyone. Who are you? 
TROI: You are aware of our existence. Our attempt to place you in
biochemical stasis has failed. We have no choice but to destroy this
ship. 
PICARD: If you destroy this ship, then others will come in search of
us. You may not be able to stop them all. Knowledge of your
civilisation would be spread across half the galaxy. 
TROI: No. 
PICARD: Allow us safe passage and I will protect your right to privacy
to the best of my ability. We will never tell anyone of your existence.

TROI: There are over a thousand lifeforms on this vessel. How could you
assure their silence? 
PICARD: This biochemical stasis, does it suppress synaptic functions? 
TROI: It does. 
PICARD: Then you must have the capability of affecting memory. Can you
erase the short-term memory of everyone on this ship, remove all
knowledge of this event, allow us to proceed as if it had never
happened? 
TROI: It would take time. One of your days. He is immune to our
influence. 
PICARD: Data, I'm going to give you a most unusual order. I'm not sure
that you will be able to integrate it into your
programme. 
DATA: As a Starfleet officer, I am required to follow all of your
orders, Captain. 
PICARD: Good, because our survival depends upon it. I am ordering you
never to reveal what has happened here today. Not to Starfleet, not to
myself. You will conceal your knowledge of the Paxans for as long as
you exist. Do you fully understood, Data? 
DATA: Completely, sir. 
PICARD: Satisfactory? 
TROI: Agreed. 
PICARD: Good. Now, our task is to eliminate from the ship's records any
information that might lead to knowledge of this incident. Let's get to
work.
