[Bridge]

RIKER: Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want to be
able to pull them out of there at a moment's notice. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
WESLEY: Commander, Romulan vessel. 
(The big green ship decloaks in front of them) 
RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. 
GUEST0: (the lady who has replaced Worf) They're arming photon
torpedoes. 
RIKER: Shields up! Go to Red Alert. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields aren't responding. 
GUEST0: They are preparing to fire photon torpedoes. 
RIKER: Mister Crusher, I need those shields! 
WESLEY: I'm trying, sir! 
GUEST0: They're firing. 
(No, they're not) 
RIKER: What happened? 
GUEST0: Instead of firing they suddenly disarmed and cancelled. 
RIKER: Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.
Lock phasers on the Romulans and hold your fire. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields are back up. 
RIKER: Impeccable timing. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields are back down. 
GUEST0: Phaser banks are down. 
WESLEY: Shields are back up. 
TROI: In another time and place this could be funny. 
RIKER: Status of torpedo banks? 
GUEST0: They're down, too. 
RIKER: In case it should become necessary to fight, could you arrange
to find me some rocks to throw at them? 
GUEST0: Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm. 
RIKER: Maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailing
frequencies. 
GUEST0: Open. 
RIKER: Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, First Officer
of the USS Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: This is Sub-Commander Taris of the Haakona. Why
have you penetrated deeper into the Neutral Zone? 
RIKER: Why are you still here? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: I have claimed this planet for the Romulan
Empire. 
RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: You will withdraw or I will be forced to destroy
your ship and your away team. 
(Transmission ends, the Romulan ship starts to cloak then decloaks
again) 
RIKER: What the hell? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: (through static) This is your final warning, I
will not 
(The picture clears up, but something else is going on off screen) 
RIKER: Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe we
could consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediate
problem? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: You're stalling for time. 
WESLEY: Sir, another probe launched from the planet, heading toward the
Romulans. 
RIKER: Have we got our phasers back? 
GUEST0: No, sir. 
RIKER: Taris, if you've got phaser capability, prepare use them now! 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: What? 
RIKER: Destroy that probe! 
(Transmission ends, the probe gets blown up) 
RIKER: And not even a thank you. 
TROI: Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because her
ship is as crippled as the Enterprise. 
WESLEY: Why would the Romulans be experiencing problems? They weren't
probed. 
RIKER: They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lot
more than she bargained for. Maintain Red Alert. Try to keep those
shields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. 
WESLEY: Commander, what about the away team? With the shields up, we
can't beam them back.

Captain's log, supplemental. While there is little
left on the surface of Iconia, we have found what appears to be a
control centre which seems to have remained intact.
