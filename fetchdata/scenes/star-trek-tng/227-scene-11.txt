TROI LAFORGE WORF RIKER CLEMENS CRUSHER

[Devidia cavern]

RIKER: Is everybody all right? 
CRUSHER: I think so. 
RIKER: You! 
CLEMENS: Where are we? And when? 
RIKER: This is the twenty fourth century, we're on Devidia Two, and
you're not supposed to be here. 
CLEMENS: Well it seems to me I have as much right to be in your time as
you had to be in mine. I wanted to see how you've conducted my future
affairs. 
TROI: Your future affairs? 
CLEMENS: The affairs of mankind. 
RIKER: But the disappearance of Mark Twain, one of the most noted
literary figures of the nineteenth century 
CLEMENS: Thank you. 
RIKER: That's not supposed to happen. 
CLEMENS: I only took advantage of an irresistible opportunity, as any
good writer would. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Away team. Acknowledge. 
RIKER: We're here, Mister Worf. Stand by to transport five. 
LAFORGE: Commander. 
(Data's headless body is lying on the floor, clutching the cane) 
RIKER: Mister Worf? 
WORF [OC]: Yes, Commander. 
RIKER: Make that six to transport.

[Transporter room]

CLEMENS: Where are we now? 
RIKER: The Federation Starship Enterprise. Ensign, call security. I
want an escort for this man. 
CLEMENS: Security? What for? Are you afraid I'm going to go around
stealing things? 
(Worf enters) 
CLEMENS: A werewolf! 
RIKER: It's a long story, Mister Worf. I'll brief you later. 
LAFORGE: Let's have Data's body taken to the science lab. I'll try and
re-attach the head we have. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, that head is over five hundred years old. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but it's the best chance we've got. 
RIKER: I want Mister Clemens kept under escort at all times. 
TROI: Commander, perhaps I could handle that. I'd be happy to take
Mister Clemens to his quarters. 
RIKER: Good idea. If you would accompany the Counsellor. 
CLEMENS: Madam, I'd be delighted. So, this is a space ship? You ever
run into Halley's comet?
