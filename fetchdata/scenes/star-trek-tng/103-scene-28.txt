TROI TASHA PICARD WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Troi's Quarters]

(Deanna enters to find her clothes strewn over her
furniture, and laughter from the bedroom) 
TROI: Tasha? What are you doing? 
TASHA: I need your advice. That's why I came to your quarters. 
TROI: Of course. Anything I can do 
TASHA: On clothes. You always wear such beautiful clothes off duty. And
your hair always looks so nice. I want to change my image. What do you
think about this? Or this one? 
TROI: It's not for you. Tasha, I feel you're very uncertain. Yhat
you're fighting something. (their hands touch) What is it? 
TASHA: Never mind. I'll find what I need myself. Ship's stores will
have it. 
TROI: Tasha? Tasha, wait. 
(Tasha leaves, giggling) 
[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: Troi to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Sir, I think Tasha's been infected too. 
[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: She just left my quarters, 
PICARD: Counsellor, it's not actually an infection. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Yes, sir. It's more like an intoxication. Nut
whatever it is, she's got it. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Thank you, Counsellor. Number One, it seems
our Security Chief has the equivalent of a snootful. 
DATA: Inquiry, sir. Snootful? 
PICARD: Forget it.

[Sickbay]

(Beverly is working in her office when Wesley calls
out to her) 
WESLEY: Hey, Mom, look what I can do. 
(She dashes into Sickbay to see him playing with his tractor beam
device) 
WESLEY: I've been able to widen and strengthen the beam, just like I
told you last night. 
CRUSHER: Do me a favour, Wes. There's something happening on this ship.
Just to be safe, I'd like you to stay in our quarters until it's
solved. 
WESLEY: Sure, Mom, sure. Your wish is my command. 
CRUSHER: Now, Wes. 
WESLEY: Okay, but you could be stunting my emotional growth, you
realise that. Why is it so hot in here, anyway? 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Crusher here. 
PICARD: Have you made a test injection yet? We're getting indications
that this condition is spreading. 
CRUSHER: No test yet, Captain, but very soon.
