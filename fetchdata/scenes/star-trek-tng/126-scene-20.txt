DATA: What is to be done with them, sir? 
RIKER: I don't know. 
DATA: Commander, a low mileage pit woofie? 
RIKER: This time you've got me. I haven't a clue. 
DATA: These are the most unusual humans I have ever encountered. 
RIKER: Well, from what I've seen of our guests, there's not much to
redeem them. It makes one wonder how our species survived the
twenty-first century.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Report. 
WORF: We are six hours from the Neutral Zone. I have been unable to
establish communications with any Federation colony or station in this
vicinity. 
PICARD: How many outposts are there in this sector? 
WORF: Nine. 
RIKER: I think we work on the assumption they've all been destroyed. 
LAFORGE: By the Romulans? 
RIKER: It fits their historical pattern. 
DATA: Since we have no contact with the Romulans for fifty three years,
seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information we
do have, is out of date. 
RIKER: The positive side of that is the information they have about us
is also out of date. Captain, I think it's that lack of information
that this is all about. 
PICARD: Go on. 
RIKER: In my opinion, the Romulans want a confrontation specifically
with us. 
PICARD: The Enterprise? 
RIKER: Well, not by name, but the Federation. They know the Federation
will send their best. That'll give them a perfect chance to see
firsthand how far we've advanced both in technology and technique. 
PICARD: What are you recommending? 
RIKER: I'm not sure I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we should
assume the initiative. 
WORF: I agree with Commander Riker. This may be our only opportunity.
We should seize it. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: The strategy is built on a single premise. The hostile intent of
the Romulans. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal. 
LAFORGE: If their intention isn't hostile, what is it? 
RALPH [OC]: Captain Picard? 
PICARD: This is Captain Picard. To whom am I speaking? 
RALPH [OC]: Ralph Offenhouse. 
[Guest lounge]

RALPH: I need to talk to you. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: What is going on here, Number One? Did you
give him permission to contact me? 
RIKER: Of course not. He must have seen me use the comm. panel. 
PICARD: Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We're in a very important conference
right now. 
RALPH [OC]: I'm sick and tired of being put off 
[Guest lounge]

RALPH: By you and your staff. This is the worst run
ship I have ever been on.
