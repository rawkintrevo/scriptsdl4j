TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI WESLEY DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Any response from Gravesworld, Mister Worf?

WORF: Nothing sir. Not since their initial communication. 
RIKER: They send out a plea for help, then they cut off transmission so
they can't tell if there's any help on the way. Doesn't make much
sense, does it? 
PICARD: Ensign, what's our ETA at the planet? 
WESLEY: Thirty six minutes to orbit, sir. 
PICARD: Starfleet Command considers Graves' work on molecular
cybernetics is reaching a critical stage. They consider this a priority
one action. 
PULASKI: A man is ill, Captain. Treating him is my priority one,
regardless of who he is.

[Corridor]

TROI: Did Data say why he wants to see us? 
LAFORGE: He said something about his new image. I tell you, he's been
acting kind of strange lately. 
TROI: How so? 
LAFORGE: Well, if I didn't know better, I'd say he was showing signs of
insecurity. 
TROI: Yes, but you do know better. Androids don't feel such things. 
LAFORGE: I don't know. Sometimes I think he's becoming more human than
any of us realise. 
[Data's quarters]

DATA [OC]: Come in. 
(Troi and Geordi enter) 
LAFORGE: Data? 
DATA [OC]: Geordi? Is Counsellor Troi with you? 
TROI: Yes, I'm here, Data. Geordi said you wanted to see us. 
DATA [OC]: Indeed. Or, stated more correctly, I wanted you to see me. 
LAFORGE: Can we come in? 
DATA [OC]: Please. 
(They go through to the inner room, and we see Data's reflection in a
full length mirror. He is sporting a full set, a beard like Riker's) 
LAFORGE: Did you damage your face, Data? 
DATA: It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One which
commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well?
Opinions? 
TROI: It's er, very different. 
DATA: When I stroke the beard thusly, do I not appear more
intellectual? 
TROI: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Goodbye. 
(Troi leaves, quickly, laughing) 
DATA: Why was she laughing?
