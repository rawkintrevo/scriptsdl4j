(She enters, picks up the armoured glove and gets
on with it)

PICARD: Status, Mister Data? 
DATA: Based on the last assumed position of the Klingon vessel, its
apparent trajectory, and our estimates of their cruising speed, we
should be in scanner range in fifteen hours, eight minutes. 
(Worf has stormed in) 
PICARD: Lieutenant? 
WORF: Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has declared a short recess, sir. I
wish to run a full diagnostic test on all tactical back-up equipment. 
RIKER: We just ran a full test of those systems. 
WORF: I feel it necessary to check them again. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, I commend your diligence. However, I'm concerned
that you're working yourself too hard. 
WORF: Sir, considering the unknown elements we are about to face 
PICARD: Lieutenant, I order you to relax. 
WORF: I am relaxed. Yes, sir. 
(Worf leaves) 
PICARD: I've never before seen the Lieutenant so unsettled. 
RIKER: The Iceman's finally melting. 
(Worf goes to the holodeck, where he sees his programme is running)

[Battleground]

(Worf watches as K'Ehleyr takes out three alien
attackers. Her blood is up when he approaches, but she takes control of
herself again) 
K'EHLEYR: It's not much of a programme. 
WORF: Computer, level two. 
(The dead aliens come back to life, and he hands her a sword. They
dispatch their attackers then she swings at him. Then they gaze at each
other, Worf takes her hand, and her scent. She does the same with him,
whilst he holds her so tightly her nails draw blood from her palm. We
are left to guess what happened next) 
K'EHLEYR: Some calisthenics programs are better than others. 
WORF: You still can make jokes. 
K'EHLEYR: You don't like people with a sense of humour? 
WORF: I did not say that. 
K'EHLEYR: Worf, you're the perfect Klingon. The ultimate minimalist.
Talk to me. 
WORF: I've noted that some people use humour as a shield. They talk
much, yet say little. 
K'EHLEYR: Whereas others take a simpler approach. Say nothing. 
WORF: When one does not have the words 
K'EHLEYR: Or is loath to speak them. Why didn't we do this six years
ago? 
WORF: We were not ready. 
K'EHLEYR: I was. 
WORF: No, we were both too young, too unaware. We lacked commitment. 
K'EHLEYR: Perhaps we lacked courage as well. 
WORF: No longer. tlhIngan jIH. 
K'EHLEYR: Wait. You can't mean 
WORF: We are mated. 
K'EHLEYR: Yes, I know. I was there. But 
WORF: And now we must solemnise our union with the oath. 
K'EHLEYR: I'm not going to become your wife! 
WORF: You already are. 
K'EHLEYR: Don't give me that Klingon nonsense. 
WORF: You would dishonour our sacred traditions? 
K'EHLEYR: They're not sacred. They're absurd! Marrying you is out of
the question for a million reasons. 
WORF: None of which stopped you earlier. 
K'EHLEYR: Worf, it was what it was. Glorious and wonderful and all
that, but it doesn't mean anything. 
WORF: That is a human attitude. 
K'EHLEYR: I am human! 
WORF: You are also Klingon! 
K'EHLEYR: So that means we should bond for life? 
WORF: It is our way! 
K'EHLEYR: Yours, not mine! 
WORF: tlhIngan jIH! 
K'EHLEYR: I will not take the oath! 
WORF: Then this night had no meaning. And that, I will not believe. 
K'EHLEYR: Believe what you will.

CLANCEY: Approaching the coordinates. 
PICARD: Slow to impulse. 
TACTICAL: Short and long-range sensor scans negative, Captain. 
PICARD: Lay in a standard search pattern. 
CLANCEY: Search pattern laid in. 
PICARD: Full impulse. Engage. 
RIKER: I hope we find them before they come out of their nap. 
PICARD: Agreed. There's not an outpost in this area could defend itself
against a Klingon warship.

[Tactical room]

(Worf enters, with Data) 
K'EHLEYR: I've been working on our assignment, trying a few computer
simulations. 
WORF: Your devotion to duty is commendable, if belated. 
K'EHLEYR: Unwilling to be alone with me? 
WORF: I asked Lieutenant Commander Data to help us analyse the
alternatives. 
K'EHLEYR: An android chaperon. 
DATA: Android, of course, is correct, but I fail to see how chaperon is
applicable in this situation. 
K'EHLEYR: Never mind. I guess I can't blame you. Tell me one thing. You
would have gone through with the oath, wouldn't you? Regardless of the
consequences to our careers, to our lives? 
WORF: Honour demanded no less. 
K'EHLEYR: What do you want? Is honour all you care about? Don't you
feel anything else? No comment, huh? Poor android. Whose behaviour do
you find more perplexing? Human or Klingon? 
DATA: At the moment, I would find it difficult to choose. 
K'EHLEYR: So would I. Okay. When we locate the T'Ong, there are two
possibilities. First
