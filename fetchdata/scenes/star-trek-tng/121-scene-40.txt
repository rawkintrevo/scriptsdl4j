LAFORGE: Come in. 
TROI: Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, we're a few minutes away from separating the
battle section. I don't have a lot of time. 
TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotional
fitness of the crew. 
LAFORGE: And you sense I'm nervous. Well, you're right. Counsellor,
deep down I'm shaking. I'm about to take this ship into battle, and
there's a good chance she'll be blasted out of the sky. I'm taking a
huge risk here, and there are a lot of lives at stake. So, yeah, I'm
nervous. Did you expect otherwise? 
TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you've
ever experienced. 
LAFORGE: You think I'm about to crack? 
TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handling
command. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some very
difficult decisions. 
LAFORGE: Then what did you want to see me about? 
SOLIS [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge. Battle bridge is manned and ready.
However, deflectors have not yet returned to full efficiency. 
LAFORGE: Let's get them there, Mister Solis. 
SOLIS [OC]: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: I'll join you shortly. La Forge out. 
TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? 
LAFORGE: Solis is doing a fine job. 
TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both he
and Ensign T'Su are very young. 
LAFORGE: No, wait. They're good officers. 
TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried about
making mistakes, and they need some encouragement. 
LAFORGE: What do I do? 
TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to you
for guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. 
LAFORGE: Like Captain Picard showed confidence in me. Right. I
understand. Thanks, Counsellor. 
[Battle bridge]

LAFORGE: Prepare to initiate separation sequence. 
T'SU: All decks report ready. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Now. 
(The saucer rises away) 
COMPUTER: Main latch bags to zero. Main latch retraction one to one
eight, initiate. Static charge compensate. 
WORF: Separation complete. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Solis, lay in a reciprocal course for Minos, warp
five. 
SOLIS: Course set. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Engage. 
[Cavern]

(Picard and Crusher are far enough apart to be out
of sight of each other, but not earshot) 
PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: No exits? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
CRUSHER: If you find one, go. 
PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. I need to sleep. Woke up too early. 
PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about those
roots. How did you know their medicinal values? 
CRUSHER: My grandmother. 
PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? 
CRUSHER: No. 
PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? 
CRUSHER: No. She helped to colonise Arveda Three. 
PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use
what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then
taught it to me. 
PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But then
there must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. 
CRUSHER: Quite a few. 
PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt.
It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. 
(He presses a button and the whole wall lights up) 
PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. 
CRUSHER: Tracking what? 
PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. 
SALESMAN: Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. 
CRUSHER: Who's that? 
PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the
Enterprise. What unit? 
SALESMAN: Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement.
The ultimate in weapons system technology. 
PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? 
SALESMAN: Impressive demonstration, isn't it? 
PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. 
SALESMAN: Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does
it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground
personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. 
PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. 
SALESMAN: Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and
all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery,
whatever you need. 
CRUSHER: It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. 
SALESMAN: The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic,
adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. 
PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are the
people of Minos? 
SALESMAN: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing
system.
PICARD: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you.
What was that noise? 
SALESMAN: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new,
stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon
against the targets on the surface. 
PICARD: Abort it! 
SALESMAN: Why would I want to do that? It can't demonstrate its
abilities unless we let it leave the nest. 
[Planet surface]

DATA: They are down there, sir. 
RIKER: Let's clear some of that away. 
TASHA: If Data's calculations are correct, the next one should show
itself in two minutes. 
RIKER: Captain! 
[Cavern]

RIKER [OC]: Can you hear me? 
PICARD: Yes, we're here! 
RIKER: Are you all right? 
(The away team are looking down through the hole at Crusher) 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher is seriously hurt. We can't contact the
Enterprise. The communicators are out. 
RIKER: Yes, our communicators are out too. 
PICARD: Those devices are part of a system located down here. Another
one is about to be released. Watch yourselves. 
TASHA: We know, Captain. 
RIKER: It's too far down there. There's nothing to hold on to. No way
to climb down. 
[Planet surface]

TASHA: I'm surprised either of them survived. 
DATA: I can do it, Commander. 
RIKER: How? 
DATA: Jump. 
RIKER: Data, it's over ten metres. 
DATA: Eleven point seven five, sir. 
TASHA: Data, you may be sturdy, but you're not indestructible. 
DATA: I believe I can safely traverse the distance. 
RIKER: Captain, Data's going down to join you down there. Be my guest.

(Data lands easily next to Beverly) 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: At your service, Captain.
