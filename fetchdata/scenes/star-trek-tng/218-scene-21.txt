LAFORGE: At first I thought the catwalk was

LAFORGE: What? What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi, have you ever had these symptoms before? 
LAFORGE: Now that you mention it, I think I have. 
CRUSHER: Do you recall when? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't. 
CRUSHER: I know we've had this discussion before, and I remember giving
you this examination. Let's check the medical logs. You've been treated
several times for headaches related to your visor but there's no
mention of dizziness. 
LAFORGE: Must be dj vu. 
CRUSHER: Both of us? About the same thing? I'd like to run an optical

LAFORGE: For an ear infection? 
CRUSHER: I have a hunch. Hold still. This pulse may be a little bright.
Have you made any changes to your visor lately? 
LAFORGE: No. Why? 
CRUSHER: I'm detecting a small phase shift in your visual receptors.
