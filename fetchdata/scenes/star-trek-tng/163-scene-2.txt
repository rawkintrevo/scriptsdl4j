RIKER CREWMAN WORF TASHA PICARD WESLEY GUINAN DATA

[Bridge] 
PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. 
DATA: Sensors are reading gravimetric fluctuations, Captain. Most
unusual ones. 
RIKER: Unusual in what way? Specify? 
DATA: Nothing I have seen before. 
PICARD: Is it a wormhole? 
DATA: Yes and no. Like a time displacement, but it does not have a
discernible event horizon. 
WESLEY: Sir, navigational subsystems are unable to give coordinates on
the object. 
DATA: Confirmed. The phenomenon does not have a definable centre or
outer edge. 
RIKER: Are you saying it is and yet it isn't there? 
DATA: I do not have sufficient information to make an analysis as yet,
Commander. The dynamics of the radiation patterns 
WORF: Captain! Something's happening. A new change in sensor readings. 
(Picard turns to face us, blocking our view of the back of the Bridge) 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Scanning sensors) 
(a ship emerges from the phenomenon, and things change. Picard's
uniform grows a higher collar and the Bridge becomes slightly darker.
People are wearing Sam Brownes) 
PICARD: Lieutenant, what are their sensor readings? Is that an enemy
vessel? 
TASHA: I'm getting too much interference, Captain.

(Guinan's clothes are different, the place is noisy
and very busy) 
CREWMAN [OC]: Now hear this. Fleet formation briefing in main war room
at fifteen hundred hours. Doctor Joshua Campbell, report to station
ops. Ensign Toms, please forward combat information. Ensign Thomas to
CIC. 
GUINAN: This isn't right. It's changed.
