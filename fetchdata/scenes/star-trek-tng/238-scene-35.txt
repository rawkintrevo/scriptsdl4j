(the two planets are merging) 
LAFORGE: The gravity well is beginning to intensify. 
RIKER: Are we far enough away to keep from being pulled in? 
LAFORGE: It's too soon to tell. 
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF [OC]: Worf here, sir. 
RIKER: How are you doing?

[Corridor]

WORF: There are force fields blocking our access to
the holodeck. It will take time to disable them. 
RIKER [OC]: Keep trying. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[221b Baker Street]

MORIARTY: Think, my dear. You're certain he said
they had to uncouple the Heisenberg
compensators? 
COUNTESS: Yes, James, I'm quite certain. But he won't do it unless you
return control of the ship to him. 
MORIARTY: I have them running around like rats in a maze. 
COUNTESS: What harm would there be in accepting his proposition? 
MORIARTY: My dear, you are as brilliant as you are beautiful.
Nonetheless, there are things you do not understand. Now, please, you
must let me handle this. Computer, arch. Moriarty to Commander Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
MORIARTY: Commander Riker, a pleasure as always. 
RIKER [on monitor]: I don't have time for games, Moriarty. This ship is
falling into a gravity well. It'll be destroyed within twenty five
minutes, holodeck and all. 
MORIARTY: Then I'm sure you'll be motivated to listen to me very, very
carefully. I want to talk to you about uncoupling the
Heisenberg compensators. 
(after the break) 
COUNTESS: James, when we go leave here, where exactly are we going? 
MORIARTY: Everywhere, my darling. There are more worlds in the heavens
than there are grains of sand on a shoreline. 
COUNTESS: I wish I could take my books. I will be so lost without them.

MORIARTY: I'll get you more. Don't worry. I promise you, you'll want
for nothing. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Moriarty. 
MORIARTY: It's time. Yes, Commander? 
RIKER [OC]: We're ready. 
MORIARTY: As are we. 
RIKER [on monitor]: Step inside the transport area.
MORIARTY: We're ready here. 
RIKER [OC]: Activating pattern enhancers. Energising.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Welcome aboard. 
MORIARTY: May I present Regina, the Countess Bartholomew. 
RIKER: Countess. 
COUNTESS: Commander. 
RIKER: You'll forgive me if I skip the formalities given the
circumstances. 
MORIARTY: Ah, yes. I expect you want me to relinquish my hold on your
vessel. 
RIKER: Please. 
MORIARTY: I'm afraid that won't be possible just yet. 
RIKER: We had an agreement. 
MORIARTY: And I intend to honour it. I have no desire to see your
vessel destroyed. Just give me one of your shuttlecraft, and allow us
to leave in peace. 
RIKER: We don't have time for this. You release the command codes and
we'll talk. 
MORIARTY: I will not release your vessel until I am looking at it
through a shuttlecraft window.

[Shuttlebay]

RIKER: Everything has been programmed to operate on
voice command. you just tell the computer where you want to go. 
MORIARTY: Excellent. 
RIKER: I suggest you head for Meles Two. It's the nearest inhabited
planet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is your
business. 
MORIARTY: Please tell your Captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I
do wish I could see his face when he realises where he's been the last
several hours. 
RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger. 
MORIARTY: Don't worry, Commander. You'll soon have control of your
ship. 
COUNTESS: Goodbye, Commander. Thank you for everything. 
MORIARTY: Computer, prepare to depart. 
RIKER: Open shuttlebay doors. 
(shuttle Sakharov flies off)

[Shuttlecraft]

COUNTESS: This is so beautiful. 
MORIARTY: Indeed, my dear. It is a wondrous sight. The first of many we
are sure to encounter in our travels. Computer, interface with the
central computer on the Enterprise. 
COMPUTER: Interface complete. 
MORIARTY: Release command function lockouts. Authorisation Moriarty,
alpha two four one five nine. 
COUNTESS: James? 
MORIARTY: Yes, my love? 
COUNTESS: Can we go back to Earth some day? 
MORIARTY: Of course, my dear. Of course.

PICARD: Computer. Store programme Picard delta one
in active memory and discontinue simulation.
