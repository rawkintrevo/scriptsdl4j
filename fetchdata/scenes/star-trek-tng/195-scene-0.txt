RIKER TROI JDAN

[Interrogation room]

 (also the ship's theatre and meeting room) 
RIKER: What were you doing accessing the propulsion system files on
Stardate 44758? 
J'DAN: I didn't. 
RIKER: Yes, you did, from computer twelve B nine, deck thirty six. The
computer logged in your identification from your communicator. 
J'DAN: It must be a mistake. 
TROI: J'Dan, we have confirmed reports that schematic drawings of our
dilithium chamber fell into Romulan hands one week later. 
J'DAN: I know nothing about it. 
RIKER: I suppose you know nothing about the explosion that disabled the
warp drive at approximately the same time? 
J'DAN: No. I was not involved. You accuse me because I am Klingon. 
TROI: Our Chief Security Officer is Klingon. That has nothing to do
with it. 
J'DAN: Send me home, then, if you are so distrusting. 
RIKER: We've already contacted the Klingon High Council. You'll be
returned home as soon as we finished our investigation. 
J'DAN: I have nothing more to say. 
RIKER: Very well. Worf, accompany the Lieutenant to his quarters. 
(Worf and J'Dan leave) 
RIKER: What do you think? 
TROI: It's hard to tell. He is very closed, but he is hiding something.
