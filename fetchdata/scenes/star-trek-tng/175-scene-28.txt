RIKER: Data, cut your engines. Take her in unpowered.

WORF: Shuttle has penetrated the Borg
electromagnetic field.

[Borg ship]

(Worf and Data materialise, and head towards Picard
the Borg. They each shoot two drones before Worf goes hand to hand with
Picard. Data shoots a third drone) 
WORF: Data! 
(Borg Picard is easily as strong as Worf. Data does something to the
back of Picard's neck to knock him out, then all three beam back aboard
the shuttlecraft)

[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Mission accomplished. We have him. 
DATA: Firing shuttle thrusters. 
(The shuttlecraft goes back out through the Borg shield)

ship, hang quietly together in space) 
SHELBY: Captain, we've sustained damage to the impulse drive.
