[Corridor]

SARJENKA: You have many different kinds of people
here. 
DATA: Yes. 
SARJENKA: When I am bigger, can I be on your ship? 
DATA: I am certain that you could. 
SARJENKA: I wish I could come with you now. 
DATA: I am afraid that is not possible. 
SARJENKA: I know, but I can still wish for it.

[Pulaski's office]

DATA: Doctor Pulaski, this is Sarjenka. 
PULASKI: Hello, Sarjenka. 
SARJENKA: Hello. 
(She picks up a brown and white stone from the desk) 
SARJENKA: What is this? 
PULASKI: An Elanin singer stone. It sings a different song for each
person. 
SARJENKA: What does it sing for you? 
DATA: It does not sing for me. 
SARJENKA: Why not? 
DATA: Because I am a machine. 
PULASKI: Sarjenka, we're going to run a few scans just to be sure
you're all right. Data's will be right here. Don't worry.

[Sickbay]

(Sarjenka lies down on a bed, and Pulaski puts her
to sleep)
PULASKI: You did a good thing, Data. 
DATA: But are we doing a good thing now, Doctor? 
PULASKI: This is to protect her as much as us. 
DATA: By robbing her of her memories? 
PULASKI: To remember you and this ship would complicate her future. She
has to be the person she was born to be. And you'll remember.

[Sarjenka's house]

(Data places the still-sleeping Sarjenka on her bed
of pillows and toys, and puts the singing stone in her hand. Outside,
the planet is still orange, but the volcanoes are just quietly smoking
now) 
DATA: Enterprise, one to beam up. 
[Bridge]

(Wesley enters) 
RIKER: Wes. Sit down. 
WESLEY: No, thank you, sir. It's going to be a long time before I'm
qualified enough to sit here. 
RIKER: You did a good job. I'm proud of you. 
WESLEY: Thank you, sir. Does it get any easier? 
RIKER: No.
