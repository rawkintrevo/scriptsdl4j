[Bridge]

PICARD: Magnify. 
(the ship is inside the pink plasma streamer) 
RIKER: The last report we have says they were observing the streamer at
medium range. Maybe they went in for a closer look, got more than they
bargained for. 
PICARD: Hail them. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Life signs? 
DATA: Our scanners cannot penetrate the plasma streamer's distortion
field. 
PICARD: Can we tractor them out? 
DATA: No, sir. Ionic interference is too heavy. 
RIKER: I'll take a shuttle in. 
PICARD: Too risky. You could be pulled in too. Bridge to Engineering. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge, can we beam an away
team onto the science ship?
LAFORGE: We can beam them over there, Captain, but with all this
interference, we might not get a positive lock to bring them back. 
BARCLAY: Commander, if we bridged our transporter system with theirs we
might be able to cut through the ionic field. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea, Barclay. Captain, I think we can do it.
We're going to bridge the two transporter systems. 
PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter room
three. 
LAFORGE: Aye sir. Barclay, I'm going to need a systems engineer on this
Away Team. 
BARCLAY: I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you. 
LAFORGE: I meant you, Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Shouldn't I stay here and set up the remote link? 
LAFORGE: Dern can do that. Come on, let's go.
