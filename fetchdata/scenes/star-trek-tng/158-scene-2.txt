RIKER: Unidentified craft in the Neutral Zone. 
[English camp at Agincourt]

RIKER [OC]: It's heading toward Federation space. 
PICARD: On our way. Picard out. We'll get to the rest of the act
another time, Data. Computer, file
programme and clear. 
DATA: Captain, why should a king wish to pass as a commoner? If he is
the leader, should he not be leading? 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Listen to what Shakespeare is telling you
about the man, Data. A king who had a true feeling for his soldiers
would wish to share their fears with them on the eve of battle. 
DATA: Sir, will I be able to schedule a performance for the crew in the
near future? 
PICARD: Let's not rush it, shall we?

[Bridge]

RIKER: Outpost Sierra Six confirms our readings,
sir. They identify it as a Romulan scout ship. Bearing two seven zero
mark one four. 
PICARD: A scout ship? What would a scout ship be doing this far into
the Neutral Zone? 
WORF: Captain. Shall we transmit a warning to withdraw, sir?

WORF: Aye, sir. Captain, the Romulan is hailing us.

GUEST3 [OC]: Federation ship. Please, help me. Requesting asylum. Under
pursuit. 
RIKER: Pursuit? 
WORF: Visual range. On screen, Captain. 
(A big mean warbird decloaks behind the little green ship, and opens
fire) 
PICARD: Red Alert. Open a channel to the warship. 
RIKER: Come to intercept course. Keep us out of the Neutral Zone. 
WORF: Channel is open. 
RIKER: how long before they cross over into Federation territory? 
DATA: Forty-one seconds, sir. 
PICARD: Romulan warbird, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Federation vessel Enterprise. You have crossed into the Neutral Zone
and are engaged in hostile action. Explain yourself and your intent. 
WORF: No reply, sir. 
PICARD: Hail the scout. 
WORF: Responding. 
PICARD: On screen. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Federation craft. Please, you must help me! 
PICARD: We are moving to intercept. Maintain your course and power. 
(The picture breaks up. The little ship has been hit) 
DATA: Scout ship is severely damaged, Captain. Engines inoperative,
shields are down. 
RIKER: Position? 
DATA: Coordinates one four zero by two zero five, sir. 
RIKER: Federation space. 
PICARD: Right. Move to within five kilometres. Mister La Forge, prepare
to extend
