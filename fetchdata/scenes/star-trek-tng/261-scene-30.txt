em surfing engines ride beamed deflectors captain away match

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We might be able to get out of here
without using the warp engines. 
RIKER: How, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: When was the last time you went surfing, Commander? 
[Bridge]

PICARD: A distortion wave. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Exactly, Captain. If can phase match our deflector shield

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: To the EM variance of the distortion wave,
when the next one hits we'll be pulled along with it. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: We could ride it through the rift and then
break away once we're clear. That is, if we survive the ride. 
PICARD: Is everyone off the Fleming? 
WORF: The last of the crew has been beamed aboard, sir. 
PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Phase matching the deflectors
shield now. 
[Bridge]

DATA: The next distortion wave will impact in
fourteen seconds. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Matching phases. Prepare to engage the
deflector shield on my mark. 
DATA [OC]: Ten seconds. 
LAFORGE: And mark. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power.
