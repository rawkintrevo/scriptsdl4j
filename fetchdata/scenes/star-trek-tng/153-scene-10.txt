TROI JEREMY LAFORGE PICARD RIKER DATA

[Turbolift]

TROI: I sense the weight of this duty on you,
Captain. 
PICARD: I really wonder. Halt. I've always believed that carrying
children on a starship is a very questionable policy.
Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks, certain dangers.
Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? 
TROI: Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leaving
him on Earth would not have protected him. 
PICARD: No, but Earth isn't likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone,
or to repel a Romulan attack, It was my command which sent his mother
to her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? 
TROI: In time, and with help. Wesley Crusher does. He does. And so will
Jeremy. 
PICARD: Resume.

[Teacher's office]

PICARD: Jeremy, I have some bad news. There has
been an accident. Your mother has died. 
JEREMY: How, sir? 
PICARD: An explosive device at the mission site. She died instantly. 
JEREMY: I understand. 
TROI: Jeremy, I know your mother loved you very much. 
PICARD: I'm told that your father is also dead. 
JEREMY: Yes, sir. He died five years ago from a Rushton infection. I'm
all alone now, sir. 
PICARD: Jeremy, on the starship Enterprise, no one is alone. No one.

[Ten forward]

DATA: Excuse me, sir. Am I intruding? 
RIKER: No, sit down. 
DATA: How well did you know Lieutenant Aster? 
RIKER: We spent some time together. Not very well. How well did you
know her? 
DATA: Why do you ask? 
RIKER: Well, you just asked me. 
DATA: But why do you ask the question? Since her death, I have been
asked several times to define how well I knew Lieutenant Aster. And I
heard you ask Wesley on the Bridge how well he knew Jeremy. Does the
question of familiarity have some bearing on death? 
RIKER: Do you remember how we all felt when Tasha died? 
DATA: I do not sense the same feelings of absence that I associate with
Lieutenant Yar, although I cannot say precisely why. 
RIKER: Just human nature, Data. 
DATA: Human nature, sir? 
RIKER: We feel a loss more intensely when it's a friend. 
DATA: But should not the feelings run as deep regardless of who has
died? 
RIKER: Maybe they should, Data. Maybe if we felt the loss of any life
as keenly as we felt the death of those close to us, human history
would be a lot less bloody. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Riker 
RIKER: You're back, Geordi 
LAFORGE [OC]: Yes, sir, and we've brought back a souvenir. 
[Ready room]

LAFORGE: There are five more just like them. All
identical to the one that killed Lieutenant Aster. 
DATA: They employ a subspace proximity detonator. A normal tricorder
would never detect it. 
PICARD: How long would you say they've been there, Data? 
DATA: It comes from the time of the Koinonian Wars, sir. 
RIKER: Did you find them all, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but, well, it seemed like they were left there to be
found. 
PICARD: Left by whom? There are no indications of life on this planet. 
LAFORGE: I don't know, Captain, but it was pretty obvious that they'd
been recently pulled out of the ground and defused.
