LAFORGE: I read your graduating thesis. Now, I
wouldn't have requested you if you weren't the best.
SONYA: Where are we going?
LAFORGE: Ten Forward. We're going to forget about work. We are going to
sit, talk, relax, look at the stars. You need to learn how to slow down.
SONYA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I can't do.
LAFORGE: You know, you're awfully young to be so driven.
SONYA: Yes, I am. I had to be. I had to be the best because only the
best get to be here. Geordi, Lieutenant 
LAFORGE: It's okay. Go on. 
SONYA: Whatever is out here, we're going to be the first humans to see
it. And I want to be a part of that. I want to understand it. 
LAFORGE: Sonya, relax. You're here. You've made it. But you won't last
long banging into walls. It'll be there for you, believe me. 
SONYA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Look, I promise I won't let anything exciting slip past
without letting you know, okay? 
SONYA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Okay.

to look around) 
GUINAN: Bridge, this is Ten Forward.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Guinan? I don't remember you ever calling
the Bridge before.
GUINAN [OC]: Is everything alright?
RIKER: How do you mean?
GUINAN [OC]: Is there anything unusual happening?
RIKER: No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask?
