BOY RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD TOQ LKOR BAEL TOKATH

[Bridge]

(at the science station) 
PICARD: What is it, Number One? 
RIKER: We've just received the Yridian's flight plan from Deep Space
Nine. 
LAFORGE: He gets around. He's been to three different systems in this
past week. He could have left Worf at any of them. 
PICARD: Are any of these systems near Romulan space? 
LAFORGE: Two of them. The Nequencia and the Carraya systems. 
(Echevarria system is too far away to be considered) 
PICARD: Let's head for the closer one. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.

[Ba'el's family's quarters]

BA'EL: What do you want? 
WORF: I am sorry if I upset you. 
(Ba'el gestures Worf to come in) 
WORF: I was surprised. I became angry. But I do not blame you. You
cannot help being what you are. 
BA'EL: There's nothing wrong with what I am. 
WORF: What I mean is, it is not your fault. 
BA'EL: What, being born? I'm sorry if that offends you. 
WORF: No, I. It is hard to explain. Klingons and Romulans are blood
enemies. Have been for centuries. 
BA'EL: Not here. Here, we live in peace. 
WORF: But I don't live here. 
BA'EL: Worf, before you knew, you were attracted to me. Can't you leave
the hatred behind, too? Can't you accept me as I am? 
WORF: I do not know. 
[Compound]

(a pair of metal staves are balanced across
uprights.) 
BOY: Come on, Toq. 
(Toq rolls a hoop and knocks the staves off) 
BOY: Who's next? Okay? Try again. 
(Worf walks over and pulls an upright out of the ground. As Toq rolls
the hoop, Worf throws the stave through it.) 
WORF: Ka'la! 
TOQ: That is not how you play this game. 
WORF: The qa'vak is not a game. It hones the skills of the hunt. 
TOQ: The hunt? We have replicators here. 
WORF: Klingons do not hunt because they need food. The hunt is a ritual
that reminds us of where we come from. 
TOQ: I know where I came from. Right here. 
WORF: It is a difficult skill to master. Perhaps you are too young. 
TOQ: Throw it. 
(so of course Toq takes the stave and gestures another boy to roll the
hoop. He misses)
WORF: Your arm is strong, but you need practice. Hold your other arm
like this and aim along it. Roll. 
(this time Toq does it right) 
WORF: You learn quickly. Perhaps it is time to put your skills to the
test. 
TOQ: What do you mean? 
WORF: Come. I will take you on the hunt. 
TOQ: You Are not allowed to leave the compound. They won't allow it. 
WORF: I think they will.

[Meeting hall]

TOKATH: Hunting? Have you lost your mind? 
WORF: The boy can come with me. I cannot sit in the compound like an
old man. I must practice my skills. 
L'KOR: We can't let you out. You've already tried to escape once. 
WORF: I give you my word as a warrior. I will not try to escape. 
TOKATH: Leave us. We have work to do. 
L'KOR: Tokath. He gave his word. 
TOKATH: Are you seriously suggesting that we open the gates and let him
wander free, with only a boy as his guard? 
L'KOR: Twenty three years ago I gave you my word. In all this time,
have I ever broken it? 
TOKATH: I told you he was yours to deal with. If you want to take this
risk, the responsibility is yours. 
L'KOR: You will go with him. Take a weapon. If he breaks his word and
tries to escape, kill him.
