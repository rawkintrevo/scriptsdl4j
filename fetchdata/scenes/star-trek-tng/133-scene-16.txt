TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD PULASKI KINGSLEY

[Science lab]

PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, are you ready to
transport? 
KINGSLEY [OC]: You have the coordinates. We have one twelve year old
male encased in number six styrolite. 
LAFORGE: Transporter, energise. 
(A male older than twelve appears on the table) 
WORF: A trick! 
LAFORGE: Transporter, reverse 
PICARD: One moment, Lieutenant. Whoever he is, he's still in stasis. 
PULASKI: The styrolite is intact, Captain. 
PICARD: Force field down. 
TROI: Captain, there's a definite presence, a distinct personality.
Even in stasis it's quite strong. The child is unquestionably
telepathic. 
PULASKI: A child this mature? We could be looking at the future of
humanity. 
PICARD: At least Doctor Kingsley's vision of it. 
(Later, as two nurses do most of the examining with various
instruments, Picard returns to the lab) 
PULASKI: This child is in better health than we are. His immune system
is so advanced it may not be possible for him to contract disease. I
want to free him from the styrolite. 
PICARD: That seems rather risky, Doctor. 
PULASKI: I can do no further tests until he's out of it. 
PICARD: But what if you're wrong? You saw what happened on the Lantree.

PULASKI: I know I'm right. 
PICARD: I can't expose the Enterprise until I know where this disease
came from and how it is transmitted. 
PULASKI: I realise that, Captain. Naturally, we'll establish a force
field containment. 
PICARD: But if we lose the force field for any reason, we lose the
ship. Force fields can fail, and until 
PULASKI: We don't have that kind of time. These children can't survive
in the lab once their parents are dead. Look at him, Captain. He's a
human being who needs our help. 
PICARD: But the risk is 
PULASKI: Minimal. 
PICARD: If you can demonstrate that he is biologically harmless without
risk to the crew, I'll do everything in my power to assist. And Doctor,
God knows I'm not one to discourage input, but I would appreciate it if
you'd let me finish my sentences once in a while.

[Corridor]

PULASKI: Deanna, do you have a minute? You've known
the Captain for some time. I think I need some advice. I don't seem to
be dealing with him very well. 
TROI: Why do you say that? 
PULASKI: Well, my arguments don't seem to have any affect on him. We
just end up quoting regulations to each other. He has such a consuming
dedication to his ship, he doesn't seem able to step back to see the
human side of the equation. 
(Troi smiles) 
PULASKI: What's the matter? 
TROI: Kate, I don't think he'd be where he is if he couldn't see the
human side of the equation. Perhaps the two of you aren't all that
different. 
PULASKI: What do you mean? 
TROI: Let's just say you both have well established personalities.

[Doctor's office]

PULASKI: Doctor Kingsley, this is Kate Pulaski. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: Doctor? Do you have a decision? 
PULASKI: I'm afraid it's bad news. 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: How can that be?! 
PULASKI: The risk to the ship and crew is too great. Until we
absolutely know the cause of the disease, the children 
KINGSLEY [on monitor]: The children are harmless. Every test on them
has been negative. I demand that you do something to save them. Please,
Doctor. For God's sake, we haven't got much time. 
PULASKI: Stand by. I'll get back to you.

[Engineering]

PULASKI: Geordi, I need your help. 
LAFORGE: What is it, Doctor. 
PULASKI: I need to prove the children are harmless. I can only do that
in a fail-safe environment. 
LAFORGE: The problem is there's no area on the ship that can be sealed
off with absolute certainty, even with force fields. 
PULASKI: Sickbay has an isolated system. 
LAFORGE: But it's not possible to totally cut it off from the rest of
the ship. The only truly independent environment would be something
like a shuttlecraft. 
PULASKI: A shuttlecraft. Why didn't you say so?

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
PULASKI: Captain, I'd like permission to put the boy in a shuttlecraft.
I can study him there without risk to anyone else. 
PICARD: What about you? 
PULASKI: I'm prepared to take that risk. Someone has to breathe the
same air he breathes, to touch him. I'm volunteering to make that test
myself. 
PICARD: Doctor, you have a responsibility to this ship which goes 
PULASKI: I also have a responsibility to humanity. 
PICARD: Starfleet guidelines about contact with quarantined 
PULASKI: You don't have to quote the rule book. You were saying? 
PICARD: Request approved. 
PULASKI: Captain, you said if I. Approved? 
PICARD: I recognise that you're trying to satisfy my conditions. 
PULASKI: Thank you.
