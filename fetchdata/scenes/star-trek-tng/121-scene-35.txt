T'SU: Sir, I'm reading life forms on the planet.
All five members of the away team. 
LAFORGE: Good. They must have freed Commander Riker. Transporter Room,
get a lock on the away team and beam them up. 
WORF: Shields just came on. Deflectors also up. I'm picking up an
object off the port bow. It's firing! 
(Enterprise's shields light up from a green beam) 
LAFORGE: Red Alert! Battle stations! We can't the away team beam up
with our shields in place. 
WORF: Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes standing by. Locking on target.
Correction. Target has disappeared. 
LAFORGE: Give me a full scan. 
WORF: Scanning. No readings yet. Wait. Something dead astern. 
LAFORGE: Emergency power to shields! 
WORF: Object is firing. 
LAFORGE: Return fire! 
WORF: No use. It's gone again. SOLIS: Aft shields weakened. Whatever
they're using, our shields can't stand up to it much longer. 
LOGAN [OC]: This is Chief Engineer Logan. Are we breaking orbit? I need
to know now. 
Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in
command. I am unable to beam up the away team due to an unseen
assailant attacking the ship. To make matters worse, Chief Engineer
Logan is on his way to the Bridge, and he's not paying a courtesy call.

[Bridge]

LOGAN: Why are we still in orbit? We're taking a
beating. 
LAFORGE: We've got to hold out as long as we can. Now, if we can
disable our attacker, if only for a few seconds, we can drop our
shields and beam the away team back aboard. 
LOGAN: If we follow that plan, we'll lose the Enterprise. In view of
the present crisis, I believe you should relinquish command to me. 
LAFORGE: No. 
LOGAN: I outrank you. 
LAFORGE: Mister Logan, I'm in command. 
LOGAN: The Captain did not anticipate the Enterprise would come under
attack. If he had, would he have left the Bridge to you? 
LAFORGE: If he had, he wouldn't have left the ship. 
T'SU: Picking up an object to starboard, sir, heading toward us. 
LAFORGE: Lock phasers on that thing and fire the moment it's in range. 
WORF: Locking in. The object has vanished. 
(The Enterprise is hit again) 
WORF: Phaser lock lost. 
T'SU: Starboard shields weakened. 
WORF: It's cloaked itself. 
LOGAN: You can't fight this thing and win. We've got to break orbit
now. 
LAFORGE: Worf, analyse its firing pattern. Maybe we can anticipate its
location. 
WORF: Aye. Solis, correlate the trajectory of the energy bolts with the
attack path. I'll compute the optimum spread of phasers and photon
torpedoes to hit it. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
LOGAN: Lieutenant La Forge. Geordi. I know you want to do what's best
for the Enterprise. So do I. Now the best thing 
LAFORGE: The best thing, Mister Logan, is for this discussion to end
and for you to return to your duties. Now, I'm in charge until relieved
by Commander Riker or Captain Picard. 
LOGAN: You're ignoring my greater rank and experience. 
LAFORGE: Not at all. In fact, just to opposite. I'm counting on it. Now
I need you to get back down to Engineering and get me every available
scrap of emergency power you can. The more power we can channel to the
shields, the longer we'll be able to hold out. Now, Mister Logan. 
(Logan leaves) 
LAFORGE: Worf, have you got a lock on it yet? 
WORF: It's impossible to be sure.

[Jungle]

TASHA: Maybe you should wait here while Data and I
search for the Captain and Doctor Crusher. 
RIKER: No, I'm a little groggy, but I'll be all right. 
DATA: I am getting energy readings. Look out! 
(They're under attack again) 
TASHA: We'll do it just like before. 
(But there's a difference) 
TASHA: It's got a deflector shield. 
DATA: The product continues to upgrade and improve. 
TASHA: We'll concentrate our fire and try to collapse its shield.
Commander, we'll need you too. 
(It drops it's shield to fire at them) 
TASHA: Now! (Three phasers and it takes some time for it to go boom)
You're right, they keep getting better. 
DATA: The weapons are appearing at intervals of precisely twelve
minutes. 
TASHA: Well this one took everything we had. I don't know how we'll
handle the next one. 
RIKER: We're not going to wait around. Let's find the rest of our team.

[Cavern]

PICARD: We seem to be in some kind of underground
structure, but I don't see any. Hey, no, you don't. No time to sleep. 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. 
PICARD: Come on, stay with me. Come on now, stay awake. That's an
order. 
CRUSHER: I must have lost a lot of blood. 
PICARD: I've stopped the bleeding. 
CRUSHER: No, there's another wound. My leg. 
(He brushes the dirt off her leg and she winces) 
PICARD: Not to worry, Everything is going to be fine. Now, this is
going to hurt a bit. 
CRUSHER: I've heard that before. 
PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Stay awake. Come on. There's a lot of blood.
What do I do next? Doctor. 
CRUSHER: The wound needs a clotting agent. 
PICARD: I couldn't find your medical kit. 
CRUSHER: Those roots. What are they? 
PICARD: Roots? What, these? 
CRUSHER: Break off a piece and taste it. Don't swallow it. 
PICARD: Very bitter. 
CRUSHER: Apply some to your hand. Is there a colour change? 
PICARD: It's turning yellowish. 
CRUSHER: Good. Now, spread as much of it as you can onto the wound. 
PICARD: Hey, hey, Doctor. Now, stay awake. You've got to help me. I
need your help. All right, now listen. Your patient has lost a great
deal of blood from multiple lacerations. 
CRUSHER: The patient's going into shock. 
PICARD: So what do I do? 
CRUSHER: Elevate the legs and try to keep her warm. 
PICARD: Good. All right. Stay with me, Doctor. Keep talking. 
CRUSHER: You didn't happen to bring a blanket with you, did you? 
PICARD: No. I'm going to look for a way out. Now, you keep up your end.
Stay awake.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: All right, I know it's risky, but a shot
in the dark is better than nothing. Let's see if we can get lucky. 
T'SU: I can't seem to pin down the pattern. 
LAFORGE: There. 
T'SU: Sorry, sir, I should have seen that. 
LAFORGE: That's all right, you're doing fine. 
WORF: Programme laid in. Phasers and photon torpedoes ready. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Mister Solis, bring her about to two three mark one
eight five. 
SOLIS: Aye, sir. 
(They are attacked again) 
LAFORGE: Fire! Now! 
WORF: Phasers and photons firing. We missed. 
T'SU: Number four shield buckling. Number three shield nearing failure.

LOGAN [OC]: Bridge, this is Engineering. I can't hold this power level
much longer. You've got to do something. 
T'SU: Backup systems are overloaded. Backup systems failing. 
LOGAN [OC]: La Forge, this is Logan. Tell me something. 
LAFORGE: Mister Logan, report to the Bridge. 
LOGAN [OC]: On my way. 
WORF: Deflectors are breaking down. We have less than one minute of
reserve. 
(Logan enters) 
LAFORGE: We are getting out of here. Lieutenant Solis, set course three
one five mark zero, zero seven. 
SOLIS: Course set. 
LOGAN: You are leaving them on the planet. 
LAFORGE: Speed warp five. 
SOLIS: Warp five. Aye. 
LAFORGE: Engage. Hold course and speed for twenty eight seconds, then
come to a full stop. Mister Logan, had we stayed, we would have been
destroyed. Now, there are over a thousand people on this ship. I have a
responsibility to them. 
LOGAN: What about your responsibility to Captain Picard and the members
of the away team? 
LAFORGE: I have a responsibility to them as well. Mister Logan, you are
going to take command of the Saucer Section. Backup crew, report to the
main Bridge. 
LOGAN: You're going to separate? 
LAFORGE: Yes, and I want you to take the saucer section and proceed
immediately to Starbase one zero three. 
LOGAN: You can't fight what you can't see, and you still won't be able
to see that thing. 
LAFORGE: Maybe we won't have to. 
LOGAN: Risky. 
LAFORGE: Yes. That's why we're going to separate. Worf, Solis, T'Su.
Report to the Battle Bridge. I'll join you in a moment. 
WORF: Ensign, secure connector levels. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

LAFORGE: Come in. 
TROI: Lieutenant, I need to speak to you. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, we're a few minutes away from separating the
battle section. I don't have a lot of time. 
TROI: I know, but as Counsellor I have a duty to evaluate the emotional
fitness of the crew. 
LAFORGE: And you sense I'm nervous. Well, you're right. Counsellor,
deep down I'm shaking. I'm about to take this ship into battle, and
there's a good chance she'll be blasted out of the sky. I'm taking a
huge risk here, and there are a lot of lives at stake. So, yeah, I'm
nervous. Did you expect otherwise? 
TROI: Not at all. You're under tremendous pressure, more than you've
ever experienced. 
LAFORGE: You think I'm about to crack? 
TROI: On the contrary. You should be proud of the way you're handling
command. You've kept a cool head, taken charge, and made some very
difficult decisions. 
LAFORGE: Then what did you want to see me about? 
SOLIS [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge. Battle bridge is manned and ready.
However, deflectors have not yet returned to full efficiency. 
LAFORGE: Let's get them there, Mister Solis. 
SOLIS [OC]: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: I'll join you shortly. La Forge out. 
TROI: Did you hear the uneasiness in his voice? 
LAFORGE: Solis is doing a fine job. 
TROI: Yes, but he isn't handling the stress as well as you are. Both he
and Ensign T'Su are very young. 
LAFORGE: No, wait. They're good officers. 
TROI: Yes, but they lack battle experience. They're worried about
making mistakes, and they need some encouragement. 
LAFORGE: What do I do? 
TROI: Just remember it's you they draw strength from. They look to you
for guidance and for leadership. Help them. Show confidence in them. 
LAFORGE: Like Captain Picard showed confidence in me. Right. I
understand. Thanks, Counsellor. 
[Battle bridge]

LAFORGE: Prepare to initiate separation sequence. 
T'SU: All decks report ready. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Now. 
(The saucer rises away) 
COMPUTER: Main latch bags to zero. Main latch retraction one to one
eight, initiate. Static charge compensate. 
WORF: Separation complete. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Solis, lay in a reciprocal course for Minos, warp
five. 
SOLIS: Course set. 
LAFORGE: On my mark. Engage.
