happening particle dribbling failing controllers encourage computer reached velocity

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Bridge. Commander, do you have any
suggestions on how we could encourage the parasites to leave the ship
once we reach the Pelloris Field? 
DATA: If we reconfigure a particle beam with a high concentration of
nitrium, and project it toward one of the asteroids. 
PICARD: Then they would follow the beam like a trail of breadcrumbs.
Very well. 
(gloop is dribbling down the wall) 
DATA: Turbolift velocity is beginning to fluctuate, Captain. 
PICARD: Computer, stop at next level. Computer, acknowledge. 
(the turbolift stops but the doors don't open, so Data forces them) 
DATA: We have reached the bridge, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Report, Number One. 
RIKER: Ventilation and life support are failing at random spots all
over the ship. 
WORF: Captain, we've dropped to warp five point seven. 
PICARD: Picard to Engineering. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: What's happening, Mister La Forge? We're losing speed. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The parasites must've gotten into the
primary warp controllers, Captain. Trying to do a bypass patch to
isolate the backup controllers but it looks like warp six is about the
best I'm going to be able to give you.
