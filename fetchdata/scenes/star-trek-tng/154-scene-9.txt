DATA: Activating power pack, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, be sure we get tricorder images of their tactical
display. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: The source of the distress signal appears to be coming from up
there, Captain. 
PICARD: Let's put an end to their last cry for help. 
DATA: Captain, I believe this is an information storage device. A crude
analogue of our isolinear optical chip. 
PICARD: Crude by our standards today, Data. But when this ship was
built, humans on Earth were just perfecting the mechanical clock, still
using steel crossbows in battle. Is there any way to see what's on
this? 
DATA: Questionable, sir. I believe I can supply power to its playback
unit, but its components are quite old. I will attempt to amplify its
image with my tricorder. 
GALEK SAR [on monitor]: I am Galek Sar, Captain of the Promellian
cruiser, Cleponji. I wish anyone who finds this record to know my crew
has behaved courageously. I want it recorded for all time that I,
alone, am responsible for the fate that befell us.
I have failed as a captain, and as the man responsible for all the
souls aboard my ship. 
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. 
RIKER [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. 
PICARD: I think we have seen all there is to see here. At Mister
O'Brien's leisure, we're ready to return. 
RIKER [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Thrilling. That was absolutely thrilling.
And I was right, Number One. There were ghosts aboard that old ship.
One of them actually spoke to us. 
RIKER: A friendly one, I hope? 
PICARD: My own counterpart. The captain's final message, praising his
crew. 
RIKER: I hope you'll be as thoughtful when the time comes. 
PICARD: Mister Data, advise the Astral Five annex. This should be
catalogued and scheduled for retrieval. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Troi and Riker have big grins on their faces) 
TROI: I'm sorry, Captain, it's just a rare pleasure to meet this side
of your personality. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the original coordinates. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
DATA: Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy
reserves. Compensating. 
RIKER: We were having a few problems while 
WORF: Readouts indicate we are being bombarded with a field of high
intensity radiation. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
DATA: Captain, energy loss increasing to five percent. 
PICARD: Yellow Alert. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Energy loss increasing, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher. Reverse course. Full impulse power. 
WESLEY: No response, sir. 
PICARD: Increase speed to warp one. 
WESLEY: Engines are not responding, Captain. 
RIKER: Mister La Forge.
