WESLEY RIKER OBRIEN TROI WORF

[Ten Forward]

(Deanna removes the pointless cherry from the top
of her dessert) 
RIKER: Chocolate ice cream, chocolate fudge and chocolate chips. You're
not depressed, are you? 
TROI: I'm fine, Commander. 
RIKER: Would you like me to leave you two alone? 
TROI: No, you can join us. 
(she offers him a spoon) 
RIKER: No, thanks. I don't like fudge. 
TROI: Really? I never met a chocolate I didn't like. 
RIKER: Doesn't it taste good? 
TROI: Of course it does, but it's not just a matter of taste. It's the
whole experience. First of all, you have to spoon the fudge around the
rim, leaving only ice cream in the middle. Then, you gently spoon the
ice cream around the sides, like you're sculpting it. Relish every
bite. Make every one an event. And then, with the last spoonful, close
your eyes. 
RIKER: I had no idea it was such a ritual. 
TROI: Chocolate is a serious thing. 
RIKER: I brought something back from Risa. Better than chocolate. 
TROI: Oh? What is it? 
RIKER: Just a game.

[Transporter room]

WESLEY: Chief O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN: Welcome back, Wesley. 
WESLEY: Congratulations on little Molly. 
O'BRIEN: Thanks you. Wait till you see her. She's the spitting image of
her dad. 
WESLEY: So, where is everybody? Is my mom around? 
O'BRIEN: The senior staff is in a meeting. You're supposed to go to
your mother's quarters. 
WESLEY: Oh. Do you think it'd be all right if I dropped in just to say
hi? 
O'BRIEN: I'll check. Chief O'Brien to Bridge. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge here. 
O'BRIEN: Wesley Crusher has arrived and wants to know if he can stop by
the Observation lounge to say hi. 
WORF [OC]: I suppose that is acceptable. 
WESLEY: Thanks.
