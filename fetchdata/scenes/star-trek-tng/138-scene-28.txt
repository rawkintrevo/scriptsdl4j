(The bellboy has taken a gun from a drawer) 
CLERK: Are you crazy? 
BELLBOY: Wrong. I'm finally getting some smarts. 
CLERK: You think you're going to scare Mickey D with that gun? 
BELLBOY: I'm going to make him leave Rita alone. 
CLERK: Kid, she's a big girl, and she's Mickey D's girl. 
BELLBOY: Not any more. Not after tonight. 
CLERK: Look, kid. I like you. I don't want to see you get hurt,
especially over some dame 
BELLBOY: Don't call her that. You'll see. You'll see how tough Mickey D
is. He's nothing. 
RIKER: I want some answers. 
CLERK: I'm sure the concierge will be delighted 
RIKER: We would like to get out of here. Now. 
CLERK: The Royale's exits are clearly marked. 
RIKER: That's not good enough. 
CLERK: If you have a complaint about the service you've received during
your stay here, you can always take it up with the manager. 
RIKER: Fine. I'd like to see him, immediately. 
CLERK: I'm afraid the manager is very busy. 
(The desk clerk leaves) 
PICARD [OC]: (faint) Riker, can you read me? 
RIKER: Yes.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: There's a good deal of interference,
but you are getting through. 
PICARD: Number One, why haven't you left that building? 
[Lobby]

RIKER: We tried, sir. It seems like we're trapped
here. We're in no immediate danger

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: But I am concerned. 
PICARD: Something about your location is interfering with
communication. We are working on the problem. 
RIKER [OC]: Standing by, sir. 
WESLEY: Captain, these frequencies are unstable. 
PICARD: Then find others. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: What is going on down there?

[Lobby]

DATA: Commander, I am picking up something most
unusual in another section of this structure. It appears to be human
DNA. 
RIKER: Where? 
DATA: Thirty one point nine metres above and to the right of us. 
WORF: Perhaps those turbolifts could take us there. 
(Of course, the doors don't open automatically for them) 
WORF: Seems to be malfunctioning. 
(Data presses the button)

[Hotel corridor]

DATA: The reading I received is from behind this
door, sir. 
(Riker knocks, then Worf opens the door and they enter) 

[Hotel room]

DATA: My reading is intensifying, sir. 
RIKER: Are you getting any life signs? 
DATA: None, sir. 
(Riker pulls back the bedsheet to reveal the desiccated remains of a
person, mostly skeleton with some remaining skin) 
DATA: Definitely human. Male. 
RIKER: Looks like the poor devil died in his sleep. 
WORF: What a terrible way to die. 
DATA: He has been dead for two hundred and eighty three years, sir. The
lack of any advanced decomposition is due to the sterile environment. 
(Worf opens the wardrobe) 
RIKER: Why would anyone go to all this trouble? It's just window
dressing for a dead man. 
WORF: Commander. 
DATA: Is this significant, sir? 
(It's a spacesuit on a hangar) 
RIKER: American. 
DATA: Fifty two stars sir. Places it between 2033 and 2079 AD. It
correlates with the debris we found. Colonel S. Richey. Rest in peace,
Colonel. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER: Finally. Riker. Go ahead.
