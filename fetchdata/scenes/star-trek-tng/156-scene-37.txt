DATA LAFORGE ARRIDOR

[Ferengi pod]

LAFORGE [OC]: I can see it with my Visor. 
ARRIDOR: I have no intention of leaving yet. We have not finished
taking our readings. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Listen, Doctor. 
[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: Your readings must be telling you the same
things we're getting. This is not the Gamma Quadrant. 
[Ferengi pod]

ARRIDOR: I will not confirm your speculations. 
[Shuttlepod]

DATA: This is not a speculation, Doctor. We are not
where the Barzans said we should be, which would indicate 
[Ferengi pod]

DATA [OC]: This side of the wormhole is not stable.

[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: There are meson and lepton fluctuations.
Local gravitational fields are increasing exponentially. Everything
says we'd better get the hell out of here. 
[Ferengi pod]

ARRIDOR: It will be visible again in forty seconds.
We will make our own judgments then. 
[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: I can see it now and I'm telling you that
you don't have time to wait. Not even forty seconds. 
ARRIDOR [OC]: Ferengi pod out. 
LAFORGE: Damn it, Arridor, we're seventy thousand light years away from
our ships. Come on, now. Follow us in. We'll lead you. 
(no reply) 
LAFORGE: Idiots. It's getting worse. I'm taking us in, Data. With or
without them. 
DATA: Thrusters at half power. Three quarters. 
LAFORGE: Entering outer event horizon. 
[Ferengi pod]

ARRIDOR: They panic quickly under pressure. There,
precisely as scheduled. Right where I expected it to be. 
(Then the end of the wormhole whizzes away from them)
