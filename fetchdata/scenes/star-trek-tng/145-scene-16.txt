PULASKI LWAXANA TROI DATA PICARD

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: How could you possibly think I would want
to share our special time together with that, that, robot of yours? 
PICARD: Because of Data's wonderful after-dinner conversation. His
anecdotes are the stuff of legends aboard this ship. 
(later) 
DATA: So, by using the square root of pi and multiplying it by nine to
the third power, I was able to accurately calculate the distance
between the Omicron system and the Crab Nebula. 
PICARD: Fascinating, Data, absolutely fascinating. I'm sure Mrs. Troi
would love to hear the one about the anomalous chemical composition of
brown dwarf stars. 
LWAXANA: Not really. 
DATA: Yes, Captain. That is a particularly spellbinding subject. In
most stars, the rare Earth element europium is enriched relative to
samarium and gadolinium 
LWAXANA: Is that so? 
DATA: It is. However,

PULASKI: Your mother seems quite an interesting
woman, Deanna. 
TROI: Perhaps I should tell you something about my mother's condition
at this time. 
PULASKI: Condition at this time? 
TROI: It's something that occurs to Betazoid females as they enter
mid-life. We call it the phase. 
PULASKI: Mid-life? As in a human female's menopause? 
TROI: Similar. It's only at mid-life that a Betazed female becomes,
well, fully sexual, if you know what I mean. 
PULASKI: Yes, I think I do. I also think that I saw the Captain on his
way to her quarters. 
TROI: I wonder if I shouldn't warn him? 
PULASKI: No. As ship's Doctor I'd consider it excellent exercise for
his reflexes and agility. 
TROI: Doctor ! 
PULASKI: For staying ahead of your mother. 
TROI: Yes. An animal is always at its best when hunted. 
PULASKI: Or when hunting.

(we now have a graphic presentation of a planetary
system on the room's view screen) 
DATA: And at this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids a
collision with the first. 
(Deanna enters) 
LWAXANA: Deanna, darling. Thank the Four Deities you're here. 
TROI: I hope I'm not interrupting. 
PICARD: No, I must, as a matter of fact, be getting back to the Bridge.

DATA: Captain. Perhaps I should remain and further entertain our guest.

LWAXANA: No! I mean, I'm sure you're needed on the Bridge as well. 
PICARD: Well, thank you for a delicious meal. We must do this again
sometime. 
LWAXANA: I know we will. 
(Picard and Data leave) 
LWAXANA: Well, Little One, the Captain is every bit as charming as your
father was.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Data, you will never know just how much I
owe you for that. 
DATA: Indeed, Captain? I know many more interesting anecdotes, sir. For
example, 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Later. 
DATA: Yes, sir.
