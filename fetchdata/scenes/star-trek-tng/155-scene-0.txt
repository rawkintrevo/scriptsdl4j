(Three figures beam onto a dark, barren, extremely
windy planet. There are occasional lightning flashes. They have to
shout to make themselves heard) 
RIKER: Placing beam-out marker. Return transport, fourteen minutes,
forty seconds. Is your view any better, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Not too bad, Commander. A lot of charged-particle
precipitation, but I can compensate. 
WORF: Communicators are dysfunctional. 
RIKER: Tricorders? 
WORF: Readings only valid within five metres. 
RIKER: Good thing we didn't bring Data. We'd be unscrambling his
circuits for a week. 
LAFORGE: Commander! Picking up something on the positron scan. Over
here. Some electrically conductive objects. 
(Metallic debris) 
RIKER: Recognise those markings, Worf? 
WORF: Yes, sir. Romulan. 
RIKER: What the hell are they doing in a Federation sector? 
LAFORGE: Picking up traces of ultritium residue. An explosive device
must've been used to destroy the craft after it crashed. 
RIKER: All right, let's spread out. Twenty five metre radius. Our
window back closes in twelve minutes. 
(They spread out and soon lose sight of each other) 
WORF: Commander! 
(Worf has found a Romulan) 
WORF: Commander Riker! 
(The Romulan is alive, and tries to strangle Worf. He knocks him
unconscious and Riker arrives. Meanwhile, La Forge falls down a hole
into mud. He is out cold and his Visor has come off. Riker and Worf
carry the Romulan back to the beam-out marker) 
WORF: Four minutes to beam-up. 
RIKER: Where is he? Wait here.
