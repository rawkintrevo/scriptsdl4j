TROI WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI GRANGER DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: Signal from the planet, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. This is Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise,
representing the United Federation of Planets. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: This is wonderful. Welcome, Captain. I'm
Wilson Granger, Prime Minister of Mariposa. 
DATA: No doubt a descendant of Captain Walter Granger. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Not quite a descendant. We feared Earth had
suffered some catastrophe when no one came back to check on us. 
PICARD: I'm afraid the truth is, you got lost in the bureaucracy. But
despite the lateness of our arrival, we're here now and we're eager to
renew ties. 
GRANGER [on viewscreen]: Splendid. Please, come down, and allow us to
extend our hospitality to you and your crew. 
PICARD: Thank you. Form an away team, Number One. 
TROI: I would urge caution. 
RIKER: Caution? What's wrong? 
TROI: He's hiding something. 
RIKER: We'll check it out. Mister Worf. Doctor Pulaski, join us in
Transporter room three for an away detail.

style)

please. 
RIKER: Twin brothers? 
GRANGER 2: Your arrival really is serendipitous. 
PULASKI: Oh, how so? 
GRANGER 2: Well, perhaps I'll let the Prime Minister to explain that. 
(Three identical women are standing by a desk) 
RIKER: Triplets? Worf, there is something damn odd down here. 
(a fourth woman walks by) 
WORF: Quadruplets.

GRANGER 2: Doctor, is your title scientific or
medical? 
PULASKI: Medical. 
GRANGER 2: Ah, excellent. 
PULASKI: Is there some medical problem we should know about? 
GRANGER 2: I think it best if the, er 
PULASKI: Prime minister explains that. Somehow I thought you might. 
GRANGER 2: Yes. Excuse me. Gentlemen? Please, follow me. 
(Pulaski runs a secret scan on another man as Worf and Riker catch up
with them) 
GRANGER 2: This way please. Doctor.
