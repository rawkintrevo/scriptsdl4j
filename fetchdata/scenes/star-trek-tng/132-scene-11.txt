RIKER: Captain, this is the Enterprise. 
[Room]

PICARD: We've arrived safely, Number One, but so
far we've been ignored. I'll keep you informed. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I would appreciate it. 
[Room]

TROI: Captain. 
WORF: Sir. 
(A well build man with red hair and beard has entered. He stops in
front of each of them in turn. Please note this actor really is deaf.) 
TROI: Riva. 
(He goes and stands on his dais. Picard steps forward but is gestured
to stop. Two men and a woman in white enter and stand in front of Riva)

WOMAN: Please, come closer. Before I start, is there anything you need?
Food, refreshments? 
PICARD: Thank you, no. 
SCHOLAR: (the man in the hat) Then proceed. 
PICARD: Greetings from the United Federation of Planets. I am Captain
Jean Luc Picard, of the USS Enterprise. This is Counsellor Troi.
Lieutenant Worf. 
ADONIS: Greetings. 
SCHOLAR: Welcome to Ramatis. 
WOMAN: I have been expecting you. 
ADONIS: You are empathic. 
TROI: Yes. 
(Riva walks towards Troi) 
ADONIS: Then although you already know my feelings toward you, allow me
to put them into words. I am looking forward to this journey, now more
than ever, because it gives me the chance to be in your company. 
TROI: I am flattered. I too am look forward to learning more about you.

(Riva goes back to his dais) 
PICARD: There are aspects to Riva of which we have not been informed. 
WOMAN: Precisely. Our way of communicating has developed over the
centuries and its one that I find quite harmonious. 
PICARD: Then Riva the mediator 
WOMAN: Is deaf. 
PICARD: Deaf? 
WOMAN: Born, and hope to die. 
PICARD: And the three of you speak for him? 
CHORUS: Yes. 
SCHOLAR: We serve as translators. We convey not only his thoughts, but
his emotional intent as well. I am the Scholar. I represent the
intellect, and speak in matters of judgement, philosophy, logic. Also,
I am the dreamer, the part that longs to see the beauty beyond the
truth which is always the first duty of art. I am the poet who 
ADONIS: Artists, they tend to ramble, neglect the moment. I am passion,
the libido. I am the anarchy of lust, the romantic and the lover. I am
also the warrior, the perfect line which never wavers. 
WOMAN: I am that which binds all the others together. I am harmony,
wisdom, balance. 
PICARD: Remarkable. And so these 
(Riva steps forward, angry) 
SCHOLAR: Speak to me! 
PICARD: What? 
SCHOLAR: Speak directly to me. 
PICARD: The uniqueness of this presentation provoked this inadvertent
breach in protocol. No insult was intended. 
SCHOLAR: Then none is perceived. 
PICARD: I'm curious about how this rare form of communication came
about. 
WOMAN: The gene for hearing is not present in my planet's ruling line. 
SCHOLAR: Not that unusual, indeed it is similar to the House of Hanover
of your planet Earth, all who had haemophilia. Or the leaders of
Fendaus Five, who were without limbs. 
WOMAN: Many of the galaxy's greatest contributors have been similarly
special. 
SCHOLAR: My Chorus is so attuned, they can hear my thoughts and
translate to you. It is a relationship which goes back for centuries.
Their ancestors provided the same service to my ancestors. 
TROI: Your method of communication is most elegant and quite beautiful.

ADONIS: It takes a fine mind to realise that, Counsellor Troi. 
TROI: This part of you doesn't speak very often. 
ADONIS: Only when the spirit moves me. 
PICARD: Riva, if you are ready, the situation at Solais Five is very
critical. We should not delay. 
SCHOLAR: Very well. 
WORF: With your permission, Captain. 
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Enterprise, this is the away team. Seven to beam up.

[Bridge]

O'BRIEN [OC]: Commander Riker. The away team, plus
four, is on board. 
RIKER: Acknowledged. Ensign, set your course for Solais Five. 
WESLEY: Course is set. 
RIKER: Velocity, warp eight. 
WESLEY: Warp eight, aye. 
RIKER: Engage, Ensign. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
(The party enters the Bridge) 
RIKER: What is this? 
PICARD: Riva id deaf. These three speak for him. Treat them as
interpreters. Address yourselves directly to Riva. Now, may I present
my First Officer. 
SCHOLAR: First, Captain, may I say it is an honour to be on board such
a fine vessel. Now, please, continue with the introductions. 
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander Riker. 
SCHOLAR: It is an honour to meet you. 
(Riva places his right hand in the centre of Riker's chest) 
PICARD: Lieutenant Commander Data. 
SCHOLAR: It is a pleasure to meet such a unique individual. 
DATA: Thank you. 
PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge. 
LAFORGE: It is my pleasure to meet you, sir. 
WOMAN: What is that you're wearing? 
LAFORGE: A visor. It interprets the electromagnetic spectrum and then
carries the readings to my brain. 
WOMAN: And without it, can you see? 
LAFORGE: Without it I'm as blind as a stump. 
WOMAN: Then your visor serves the same function as my Chorus, which
interprets my thoughts and translates them into sound? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
SCHOLAR: And you don't resent it? 
LAFORGE: The visor or being blind? 
SCHOLAR: Either. 
LAFORGE: No, since they're both part of me, and I really like who I am,
there's no reason for me to resent either one. 
SCHOLAR: What is your position on the ship? 
LAFORGE: I'm the Chief Engineer, sir. 
WOMAN: It's a blessing to understand we are special, each in his own
way. 
LAFORGE: Yes. Yes, that's the way I feel exactly. 
PICARD: I offer the hospitality of my vessel. And at your convenience,
there is a briefing on the Solari wars. If you wish, I'll have you
conducted to your quarters. 
WOMAN: Thank you. 
ADONIS: Perhaps, if it is not inconvenient, Counsellor Troi could
escort me. With your permission. 
TROI: This way. 
(Troi leaves with Riva and the Adonis) 
RIKER: What about you? 
WOMAN: At times like this, we become an encumbrance. 
SCHOLAR: So, if you have rooms for us? 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf will escort you. 
RIKER: Riva's not what I expected.
