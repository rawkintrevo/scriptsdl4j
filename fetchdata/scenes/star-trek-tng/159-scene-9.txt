RIKER OBRIEN SECURITY

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: We're holding the contents in stasis
pending arrival of security. An illicit weapon has been detected in the
transport beam, sir. 
[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: It's been rendered inoperable. 
RIKER: Work, let's greet our guest.

[Transporter room]

SECURITY: Bring him in, Mister O'Brien. 
(The escaped prisoner raises his weapon.) 
SECURITY: Just stay where you are. 
(The security guard fires, but it has almost no effect. They are jumped
by the prisoner) 
O'BRIEN: More security, transporter room four. More security! More
security! 
(O'Brien tries to help out by getting the prisoner in a head lock, but
he is easily
thrown off. The two guards grab the man and they tumble out into)

[Corridor]

(Where one is thrown off down a side passage and
the other nearly has his arm pulled out. O'Brien shoots the prisoner in
the back with a phaser, but again, it has little effect. O'Brien gets a
return shot for his trouble. The turbolift doors open, and Worf pushes
Riker out of the line of fire just in time. They rush to help the guard
who had been thrown down the passage and finally Worf pins down their
quarry) 
RIKER: Get him to a detention cell. Set phasers on maximum stun. 
O'BRIEN: Commander.
