[Sickbay]

(While Beverly puts the results of her latest scan
into her computer, Geordi takes off his comm. badge and walks out into
the corridor. When she gets there, he is nowhere in sight) 
CRUSHER: Geordi!

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Security. Lieutenant La Forge just left
Sickbay while I was in my office. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: He doesn't have his communicator. It
is very important that we find him. 
TASHA: Security team alert, pick up Lieutenant La Forge. He just left
Sickbay moments ago. Captain, anything further? 
PICARD: Affirmative. Make it a ship-wide search, Lieutenant. 
[Crusher's quarters]

(Geordi is with Wesley, who is showing off his
latest device by floating a chair around the room) 
WESLEY: It's a model of the same kind of tractor beam our ship uses
with a few ideas of my own added. 
LAFORGE: So that's your science project, huh? Wes, you're really
something. 
WESLEY: And since the Captain won't let me on the Bridge, I use this to
imagine I'm there. 
PICARD [OC]: Take the helm, Mister Crusher. Set a course for thirty
seven mark one hundred eighty. Warp six. 
LAFORGE: It's the Captain's voice. 
WESLEY: It's pieced together from words he's used on the intercom. With
this, I can pretend he's ordering me to take the Enterprise anywhere.
And listen to this, 
PICARD [OC]: Chief Engineer, report to the Bridge. Commander Riker,
report to the Bridge. Doctor Crusher, report to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: What do you think? 
LAFORGE: I think the Captain's lucky you're on his side. 
WESLEY: But he still won't let me on the Bridge. And there's nothing
there I don't understand. 
LAFORGE: I wish I understood myself that well. 
WESLEY: Are you okay? 
LAFORGE: No, Suddenly I seem to be burning up inside. It's hot in here.

[Observation lounge]

(Geordi is staring out at the stars) 
TASHA: Geordi? Geordi? Lieutenant Yar in the Observation lounge. Send a
team here now. Medical's been worried about you. 
LAFORGE: Help me. Help me to not to give in to the wild things coming
into my mind, 
TASHA: Geordi, my job is security, 
LAFORGE: Tasha, please. 
TASHA: Alright. Alright, helping is more important. Geordi, how can I
help you? 
LAFORGE: Help me to see. Like you do. 
TASHA: But you already see better than I can. 
LAFORGE: I see more. But more isn't better. 
(He takes off his Visor) 
TASHA: Geordi, please put 
LAFORGE: I want to see in shallow, dim, beautiful human ways. 
(He strokes her face) 
TASHA: We'll talk about it, Geordi. Right now I'm going to take you to
Sickbay. All right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
TASHA: Okay. Good.
