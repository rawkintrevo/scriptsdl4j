DATA [OC]: It is Vacca Six in the Cabral sector.

PICARD: Very well. Helm, set course for Vacca Six. 
GATES: Aye, sir. 
[Holodeck Cavern]

(the meal is ending and Vorin is writing on a
series of thin wooden sheets) 
WORF: What is this? 
VORIN: Our chronicle. The history of our village. Doesn't your village
keep a chronicle? 
WORF: Not in this manner. 
VORIN: Then how do you teach your children their history, who their
ancestors were, where they come from? 
WORF: We tell each other stories, make up songs. 
VORIN: Stories change with each person who tells them. This, this will
always be the same. Our chronicle has been maintained for seventeen
generations. I was only able to save the last six. This shows the
destruction of our village. This is you and Nikolai leading us to
safety. 
WORF: We must leave. Gather your belongings. 
VORIN: One of the scrolls is gone. I must have dropped it in the
passageway. I'll go find it. 
WORF: We must stay together. We will have to leave it behind. 
VORIN: Worf, the chronicle is the life of our village. Without that
past, our future means nothing. I must find it. 
WORF: Go, and return quickly. 
KATERAS: Seer. I am an old man. Would you help me with my gear? 
WORF: Of course. 
KATERAS: That is Tarrana, my daughter. I am fortunate she was old
enough to survive the storms. 
WORF: She is a fine girl. 
KATERAS: She is a beautiful girl. She has not been promised to anyone.
If I do not reach our new home, I would like her to become your wife. 
WORF: You will reach your new home. I promise. 
(meanwhile, Vorin has found his scroll, and the arch partly showing in
the rock. He touches it and the door appears. He steps forward, it
opens and out he goes)

[Corridor]

(Vorin walks along, mouth wide open. Most people
ignore him) 
WOMAN: Can I help you? 
(he backs away into)
