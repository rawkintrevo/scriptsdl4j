RIKER COMPUTER CRUSHER TROI ALKAR

[Corridor]

RIKER: I don't know what you thought you were doing
in there, but you were way out of line. 
[Turbolift]

RIKER: Deck nine. 
[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: All right, Deanna, just what the hell is all
this?
TROI: Imzadi, do you still care about me?
RIKER: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's all
this?
TROI: Don't you think I'm attractive?
RIKER: This just isn't you.
TROI: Oh, it is. You want me, don't you?
(she pulls him in for a kiss) 
RIKER: Deanna.
TROI: I need you.
(Her long nails scratch his neck, drawing blood) 
RIKER: What is this?
TROI: Please! 
(Next morning, Troi is in uniform when the doorbell rings) 
TROI: Come in.
ALKAR: Deanna, I'm leaving for the surface.
(She turns to us, showing her grey hair and lined face) 
TROI: You said you'd take me with you.
ALKAR: I know, but that's not possible now.
TROI: You told me I'd be helpful. You needed me.
ALKAR: And I still do. You've done so much for me.
TROI: Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you?
ALKAR: She's been on Seronia for weeks. She knows the people, the
situation.
TROI: She wants to take you away from me.
ALKAR: Deanna, you are my anchor. I need you more than you can possibly
realise. Do you understand that? I need you here, making it possible
for me to do my work.
TROI: I won't let her have you! I'll stop her! (she follows him into
the corridor) I will go with you. Take me with you. Please, Alkar.
Don't leave me. Don't do this! No!

[Crusher's office]

(Will is getting his scratches healed) 
RIKER: You wouldn't have recognised her. Her dress, her hair,
everything about her. I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been to
anyone, but last night she was someone that I had never seen before.
CRUSHER: And you don't know of anything that might have caused her to
behave like that?
RIKER: No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer.
CRUSHER: Computer, location of Counsellor Troi.
COMPUTER: Deck six, corridor B. 
CRUSHER: Let's go.
