WESLEY: I guess you would have preferred Commander
Riker as a travelling companion. 
PICARD: What? 
WESLEY: It's okay. You're not too comfortable with me. I understand. 
PICARD: Ensign. Wesley, that's not true. You're a fine young man. 
WESLEY: You don't have to say that, sir. It's pretty obvious how you
feel. 
PICARD: Is it? How so? 
WESLEY: Everyone knows. You don't like kids. That's too bad. You'd have
made a good father. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
(Picard takes his book to a rear seat) 
WESLEY: Didn't you ever wish you had kids of your own? 
PICARD: Wishing for a thing does not make it so.

(The Bridge crew are watching the activity, or lack
of it, on the Pakled ship) 
RIKER: We send him over there for one set of repairs, now they need him
for more. 
DATA: Apparently, their ship is apparently quite fragile. 
RIKER: This is Riker on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Almost got it, Commander. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: We look for things. 
RIKER: Apparently your ship is in need of more than minor repair. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: Things to make it go. 
RIKER: We will use our tractor beam to tow you to the nearest base. 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: He can make it go. 
RIKER: Yes, but we need our Chief Engineer back on board our ship. 
(The Pakled lights come back on) 
GREBNEDLOG [on viewscreen]: He is smart. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: All done, Commander. 
RIKER: Prepare to beam over. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
 [Pakled ship]

REGINOD: You are good. 
LAFORGE: We aim to please. 
REGINOD: We need you. 
LAFORGE: I'm flattered. Look, fellas, I hate to repair and run, but if
you'll excuse me. One to beam aboard. 
(Grebnedlog grabs his phaser and stuns him) 
LAFORGE: Hey! Don't! 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Transporter room, beam La Forge back
immediately. 
CHIEF [OC]: Aye negative response, sir. 
RIKER: Try again! 
CHIEF [OC]: Negative response! 
DATA: The Pakled ship has a shield up, sir. 
RIKER: A shield? What kind? 
DATA: It appears to be beyond their technology. Similar to Romulan
shields. 
RIKER: Do not interfere with our transporter beam. Drop your shields. 
(They lose the viewscreen picture) 
RIKER: Status? 
WORF: Viewer transmission terminated and blocked. 
RIKER: Hail on all frequencies. 
DATA: Running frequency search. Negative, sir. 
RIKER: They're ignoring us. 
DATA: Apparently so. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
WORF: Shields up. 
RIKER: Sensors at maximum sensitivity. 
DATA: Sensors at maximum. 
WORF: Phasers ready, sir.
