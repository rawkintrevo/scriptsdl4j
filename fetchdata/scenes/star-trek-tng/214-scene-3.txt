PICARD RIKER RO LAFORGE WORF

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Navigators on this ship have been doing
flight handling assessments the same way for years, Ensign. 
RO: And I've found a better way. 
RIKER: Bridge. Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure before
you make them? 
RO: If I had come to you in advance and asked you to do it my way 
RIKER: I might have said 
RO: No. 
RIKER: Yes, maybe. The point is, I didn't get the chance. 
RO: The point is, with all due respect Commander, you're trying to turn
me into your idea of the model officer. 
RIKER: The rules on this ship do not change just because Ro Laren
decides they do.

WORF: We are picking up a subspace signal, Captain.
Sensors indicate a small spacecraft ahead. 
LAFORGE: The configuration is unfamiliar. Nothing in our database comes
close. 
WORF: Within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(vaguely triangular with green lights) 
PICARD: Analysis, Mister Worf. 
WORF: No discernable armament. Reading one lifeform aboard. 
PICARD: Hail the vessel. 
WORF: No response, Captain. 
LAFORGE: We're being scanned. It's not like any sensor system I've ever
seen. Shall we raise shields? 
PICARD: No, let's begin this with a show of good faith. 
WORF: Sir, the scans are now matching the frequency of our optical data
network. It could be an attempt to access our computer system. 
LAFORGE: Scanning intensity has increased by fifteen hundred percent. 
PICARD: Shields up.
