[Ten Forward]

(at the bar) 
DATA: One Samarian Sunset, made in the traditional style. 
(Data puts a glass of clear liquid in front of Deanna, then taps it
with his fingernail. A yellow glow diffuses into orange in the glass) 
TROI: It's beautiful. 
DATA: I hope you enjoy it. 
(a green light passes across Data) 
DATA: I hope you enjoy it.

[Bridge]

WORF: The scanning signal has penetrated our
shields. 
LAFORGE: Computers are going down. 
PICARD: Take evasive action. 
RO: The helm's not responding. 
(the Bridge is briefly flooded with bright green light) 
PICARD: What happened? 
LAFORGE: What the hell? 
RIKER: I don't know who any of you are. 
PICARD: Nor do I. I don't even remember who I am. 
(after the titles) 
LAFORGE: Looks like we're all in the same boat. 
RIKER: Make that on the same starship. 
MACDUFF: But who are we? What are we doing here? 
(who are you, sunshine?) 
RO: It looks like I'm the pilot. We're not going anywhere now. The
helm's dead. 
PICARD: But you still know how to work it. 
RO: Yes. 
RIKER: This console has tactical configuration? 
WORF: Yes. Phaser power status, intruder scan, torpedo guidance. But
they do not appear to be operable. 
PICARD: Clearly, we still possess certain skills. It would seem we know
how to operate this ship. But our identities have somehow been erased
or suppressed. 
RIKER: We are on the Bridge. There's a good chance this is our ship.
Looks like you're the leader. 
WORF: Perhaps we should not jump to conclusions. I am decorated as
well. 
PICARD: It seems to me that determining leadership is not crucial right
now. We need to find out who we are and well, what we're doing out
here. 
MACDUFF: But how did this happen? What did this to us? 
LAFORGE: Better still, who did this to us? I've got some intermittent
sensor readings here. The scan keeps repeating itself like it's stuck,
but it looks like there's metallic debris right in front of us.
Distance, seventeen kilometres. 
RIKER: The remains of another ship? 
LAFORGE: That's a good possibility. 
WORF: Perhaps we were engaged in battle. 
MACDUFF: If they stunned us with some type of bioelectric field that
could have wiped out our memories. 
RO: Then we fired back, destroyed them. 
PICARD: But if that presumption is correct, then we could have
sustained other damage. Um, Computer, status report. 
RIKER: No voice interface. 
LAFORGE: No interface, period. Hey. Got something. I've accessed the
basic system directories. 
PICARD: Can we get a general status report? 
LAFORGE: Life support systems throughout the ship are fully
operational. Navigation, propulsion offline. 
RO: What about communications? 
LAFORGE: Completely disrupted. 
RO: That rules out a distress signal. 
RIKER: If we even knew where to send it. 
PICARD: Do we have an onboard communications system? 
LAFORGE: We do now. 
PICARD: Lets use it. This ship must have a crew. They may still have
their memories. 
RO: We should be careful what we say. There could be a boarding party
somewhere on the ship. 
WORF: Bridge to all personnel. Select a representative from your group
to contact the Bridge and report on your status.
