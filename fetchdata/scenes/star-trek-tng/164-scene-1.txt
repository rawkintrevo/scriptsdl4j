[Corridor]

LAFORGE: He sent for you too? 
TROI: Yes. He was very mysterious. 
WESLEY: Does you have any idea what this is about? 
LAFORGE: Something happened at that cybernetics conference. Since he's
come back he's spent every off duty minute in that lab. 
TROI: It's not like Data to be so secretive. 
WESLEY: And cautious. He kept the lab locked every minute. 
LAFORGE: Now how would you know that? Ah ha. 
(Wesley pushes the button, and the door opens) 
DATA: Oh, you are early. Just a moment please. 
(The door shuts in their faces) 
[Laboratory]

(We see Data fasten a foot to a leg, and make it
wiggle its toes. Then the platform it is on ascends out of our sight.
He opens the door again) 
DATA: You may enter now.
LAFORGE: Come on, Data, what is this? 
WESLEY: Yeah, Data. what's going on? 
DATA: I have invited you here to meet someone. 
(The platform is brought down from the ceiling again. It contains what
would be a naked person, if it were flesh and blood) 
DATA: This is Lal. Lal, say hello to Counsellor Deanna Troi 
LAL: Hello Counsellor Deanna Troi. 
TROI: How do you do, Lal? 
LAL: I am functioning within normal parameters. 
DATA: Lal, this is Geordi La Forge. 
LAL: Purpose for exterior drapings, Father? 
WESLEY: (mouthed only) Father? 
DATA: It is an accepted custom that we wear clothing. 
WESLEY: Data, it called you Father. 
DATA: Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child.
