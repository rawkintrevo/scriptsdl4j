RIKER: Something, anything to can cut through the
storm. Some way to get a signal through to him. 
WESLEY: A neutrino pulse. We could build a portable neutrino source and
send it in a probe to the planet surface. It'll act like a beacon. 
DATA: A neutrino pulse would send non-charged particles back up through
the atmosphere and would be detectable by Geordi's Visor. 
WESLEY: He can show us that he's found it by modifying the pulse 
PICARD: Make it so. 
DATA: Captain, I have a new transmission on a parallel frequency to the
distress call. 
PICARD: From the surface? 
DATA: No, sir. From inside the Romulan Zone. We should be able to view
the transmission. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(everyone, say Hi! to Andreas Katsoulis aka G'Kar the Narn from Babylon
5) 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Tomalak to Pi. We have received your distress
signal. Respond. If you can hear me, we are entering the Neutral Zone
now. We will reach you in six hours. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, hail the Romulan vessel. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Romulan vessel, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
Federation Starship Enterprise. 
WORF: The frequency is open, sir. 
PICARD: Commander Tomalak, we have intercepted your transmission. You
are not to enter Federation space. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, my apologies. Had I known you
were in this sector, I certainly would have advised you before crossing
the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Indeed? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure you will understand when I explain.
One of our ships had a slight navigational error and apparently crashed
on Galorndon Core. 
PICARD: A slight navigational error? Nearly half a light year past the
Neutral Zone? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I assure you, Captain, no aggression was
intended. 
PICARD: Commander, we have recovered one of your survivors. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: He is on board your ship? 
PICARD: He is being treated for severe injuries. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And his craft? 
PICARD: Destroyed, deliberately, after the crash. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm sure you are prepared to leave at once and
rendezvous with me in the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: I have an away team on the planet. We are waiting for a window
in the storm to beam them up. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And then you will return my officer? 
PICARD: Are there any other Romulans we should be looking to recover
from Galorndon Core? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: No. It was a one-man craft. Captain, we will
be at the Federation border of the Neutral Zone in roughly five hours.
We will expect you to rendezvous at that time. 
(transmission ends) 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: There's great hostility behind his smile. He'll stop at nothing
to complete his mission. 
RIKER: Including the Neutral Zone border. 
WORF: Captain, I see no reason to return the Romulan to his ship. He
should be held and interrogated. 
RIKER: We have every right to detain him, sir. 
PICARD: Without evidence of intent, Number One, it will not be a simple
matter. 
RIKER: It obviously wasn't pilot's error. I think it demands a response
from us. 
PICARD: But we must measure our response carefully, or history may
remember Galorndon Core along with Pearl Harbour and Station Salem One
as the stage for a bloody preamble to war.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I want him off all the drugs. They're not
doing anything. Doctor Crusher to Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: My patient is not responding

[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: To treatment. 
PICARD: You haven't found a compatible ribosome donor? 
CRUSHER: The lab is still processing the tests. Early results indicate
humans have far 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Too many bio-rejection factors. I've also
ruled out the Vulcans we've tested. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: I think I'll try a little
old-fashioned country medicine. Keep the fever down, try to let the
body heal itself. 
PICARD: Keep me advised. Picard out. 
WESLEY: Captain, the neutrino beacon is operational, and we've placed
it aboard a class three probe. 
PICARD: Well done, Ensign. Mister Worf, launch the probe. 
WORF: Aye, aye, sir. 
(Geordi is making his way along a rock face streaming with rain,
immediately above a lake) 
WORF: Probe has reached the surface, sir. 
DATA: The neutrino stream is coming in strongly. Sensors are tracking
the probe despite the interference.

[Cave mouth]

(Geordi has found shelter at last, and can see a
blue coloured vertical jet emanating
from some way away) 
LAFORGE: A stationary neutrino source. Wesley Crusher. Thank you,
Wesley. 
(So he heads off towards it, and someone comes up behind him and knocks
him out. Another Romulan. When Geordi wakes up, his own phaser is being
pointed at him) 
BOCHRA: You are my prisoner. 
LAFORGE: Right. Congratulations. Surely a strategic triumph for the
Romulan Empire. 
BOCHRA: Stay there. 
LAFORGE: My shoes are getting full of sand. I just hate that, don't
you? 
BOCHRA: Name and rank. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge. I don't think I got
yours? 
BOCHRA: A Romulan ship will arrive shortly. You will accompany me on
board. 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. You see, we heard your message too and well,
the fleet's in, Commodore. Sky's full of Federation ships. 
BOCHRA: You're lying. 
LAFORGE: I never lie when I've got sand in my shoes, Commodore. 
BOCHRA: Get up. 
LAFORGE: Seriously, the only one way out of here is for you to put that
thing down and soon as there's a window in the storm 
(There's a rock fall, and Bochra gets hit badly. Geordi helps him up
and carries him into the nearest cave)
