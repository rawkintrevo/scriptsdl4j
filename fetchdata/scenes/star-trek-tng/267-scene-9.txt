bridge ahead need engineering forge identification aboard abandon boost

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're holding position in the Argaya System.

PICARD: Anything? 
WORF: No, sir. I detect no vessels in the vicinity. 
PICARD: How close to the Cardassian border are we? 
DATA: Less than five thousand kilometres, sir. 
WORF: Sir, I am detecting an object five metres in length. It appears
to be an escape pod. 
RIKER: They must have been forced to abandon the ship. 
PICARD: How far inside Cardassian space is it? 
WORF: Fifty thousand kilometres. 
PICARD: How the hell are we going to get it out of there? 
DATA: Sir, the pod's life support system is failing. 
RIKER: Notify Doctor Crusher. 
PICARD: Can we get within transporter range without crossing into
Cardassian territory? 
DATA: We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at
least seven percent. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I'm on it, Captain. There, try that. 
TAURIK: The pod is still too far away. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to try augmenting the frequency spread. 
TAURIK: Bio readings indicate that passenger's humanoid. Attempting
life form identification. 
LAFORGE: No one told you to do that, Ensign. Let's just get him aboard
safely. There, that should do it. 
TAURIK: Confinement beam's at one hundred nine percent of normal. 
LAFORGE: Transporter room, you should be able to get a lock now. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD [OC]: Doctor Crusher, are you ready? 
CRUSHER: Stand by. Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to
leave now. 
OGAWA: All right, Doctor. 
(Alyssa leaves) 
CRUSHER: Transporter room. go ahead. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.
