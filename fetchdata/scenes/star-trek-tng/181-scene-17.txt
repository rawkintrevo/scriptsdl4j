(both Duras and Gowron have an armed Starfleet
guard) 
DURAS: The Council must have a leader now! Complete the rite so I can
kill this ha'DIbah. 
GOWRON: You will die slowly, Duras. 
DURAS: You have already proved you don't have the courage to face me.
Perhaps you should plant another bomb! 
(they square up to fight) 
PICARD: mev yap! Sit down. We will begin the ja'chuq. 
GOWRON: What? 
DURAS: This woman has been giving you bad advice, Picard. The ja'chuq
is obsolete. 
PICARD: It is my choice to respect the ancient rituals. Each of you
will have to prove your worthiness to lead the High Council. 
GOWRON: That will take hours. 
K'EHLEYR: Or days, depending on your cooperation.

[Worf's quarters]

(Alexander is gazing at a large curved weapon on
the wall) 
ALEXANDER: What is this? 
WORF: A bat'leth. It belonged to my father. It has been in our family
for ten generations. 
ALEXANDER: Let me hold it. 
(Worf takes it down and the little boy holds it, instinctively moving
it in curving motions) 
WORF: No, no, no. Do not think of it as a weapon. Make it part of your
hand. Part of your arm. Make it part of you.

[Observation lounge]

(K'Ehleyr is working alone when Gowron of the
bug-eyes enters) 
K'EHLEYR: The next meeting is in three hours. 
GOWRON: I would speak with you alone, Ambassador. 
K'EHLEYR: I'm honoured. 
GOWRON: Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq. Why? 
K'EHLEYR: He has sufficient reason to proceed carefully. 
GOWRON: He relies on you for his knowledge of Klingon law. 
K'EHLEYR: Yes. 
GOWRON: Then he values your advice. You could quicken the pace. 
K'EHLEYR: Possibly. Why should I? 
GOWRON: Your position is unique. Have you never wondered about serving
the Klingon Empire? 
K'EHLEYR: I serve in my own way. 
GOWRON: As a Federation Ambassador. A few rewards, but little glory. 
K'EHLEYR: What do you want? 
GOWRON: What do you want? Command of a ship? A seat on the Council?
There are many opportunities for you in the Empire. 
K'EHLEYR: Opportunities that will present themselves only if you come
to power. You talk like a Ferengi. 
GOWRON: K'mpec was also stubborn. He too refused to listen. Now, he's
gone. You need not make the same mistake. 
K'EHLEYR: K'mpec was old and weak. I am not.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We've completed our analysis of the bomb
debris, Commander. 
DATA: The explosive was a triceron derivative. 
LAFORGE: And the entire device couldn't have been more than three cubic
millimetres in size. 
RIKER: It could have been hidden anywhere in that room. 
LAFORGE: There's one more thing. The bomb had a molecular-decay
detonator. 
DATA: Only one race uses that device, sir. 
RIKER: The Romulans.
