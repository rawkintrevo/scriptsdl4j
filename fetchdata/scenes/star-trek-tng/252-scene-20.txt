PICARD RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF

[Planet surface]

(near the shuttlecraft El-Baz, in a very gold-brown
tint) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We're on the surface. There's no sign of
any Borg, or Data. The shuttle appears to be abandoned. 
WORF: The EM interference is limiting the tricorder range. It is
useless beyond one hundred metres. 
RIKER: There are

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: No structures in the area. They
could've gone anywhere. 
PICARD: Can you determine how long they've been gone from the
shuttlecraft? 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: The engine's been off a little over three
hours. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by, Number One. Assuming that they're
still together, how far could they have travelled in three hours? 
LAFORGE: Well, Data can move pretty fast even over rough terrain, but
based on what we know about the Borg, I don't think they should be able
to move any faster than you or I. They might have been able to get
fifteen or twenty kilometres from the shuttle by now. 
PICARD: Picard to Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PICARD: I'm going to start sending down other away teams. Set up a
command post and begin mapping out a search plan. 
RIKER [OC]: Understood, sir. 
PICARD: Picard out. I want to use the shuttlecraft for low level
reconnaissance. Have the designated pilots assemble at main shuttlebay.

LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: And all available personnel, including you and me, will begin
to put together four man away teams. We'll leave a skeleton crew on
board the ship. 
LAFORGE: Who'll be in command of the Enterprise? 
(later) 
CRUSHER: Any last orders? 
PICARD: If the Borg should attack, don't wait for me or anyone else to
return to the ship but take the Enterprise to the transwarp conduit.
Return to Federation space. 
CRUSHER: Got it. Good luck, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: Good luck, Captain.
