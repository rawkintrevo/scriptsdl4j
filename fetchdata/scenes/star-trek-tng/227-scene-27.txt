GUINAN: I'm thirsty. 
PICARD: I'm going to get help. We have to get you out of here. 
GUINAN: No, don't go. They'll be back for you soon. 
PICARD: No, you need help. 
CLEMENS: This thing put me down in the middle of Market Street. Took
forever to get here.

[Bridge]

WORF: Commander La Forge has completed the
reconfiguration of the photon torpedoes. 
RIKER: If Clemens got back, the Captain should have been here by now. 
WORF: We have no way of knowing if Mister Clemens was successful. 
RIKER: Re-establish your firing pattern, Mister Worf. We'll wait five
more minutes. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Cavern]

CLEMENS: No time for chit chat, sir. According to
Mister La Forge, who did get your message by the way, a frequency
setting of point oh four seven on your phaser will correctly activate
this creature. 
PICARD: Now you have to get help. Guinan needs medical attention. 
CLEMENS: I promise you she will be attended to. 
PICARD: And there is a bill to be settled at Mrs. Carmichael's boarding
house. 
CLEMENS: I'll settle it. 
PICARD: Thank you. I wish, I wish time would have allowed me to know
you better. 
CLEMENS: You'll just have to read my books. What I am is pretty much
there. 
GUINAN: I'll see you in five hundred years, Picard. 
PICARD: And I'll see you in a few minutes.

DATA: Commander, I am picking up massive triolic
wave activity on the surface. 
RIKER: Is it the Captain? 
DATA: There are no human life signs. 
RIKER: No sign of a temporal distortion? 
DATA: No, sir, but triolic activity is increasing. 
RIKER: The aliens. Mister Worf, are the photons ready? 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Fire. 
WORF: Torpedoes away, sir. 
DATA: Sir, I am detecting a temporal distortion on the surface and
human life signs. 
RIKER: O'Brien, get him out of there! 
(KaBOOM on Devidia) 
RIKER: Transporter room, have you got him? 
PICARD [OC]: He has indeed, Commander. And believe me, it's good to be
back. 
WORF: We have destroyed the target. There is no further indication of
triolic activity. 
RIKER: Ensign, lay in a course to the nearest Starbase. Warp six. 
Captain's log, stardate 46001.3. Everyone who
should be in the nineteenth century is safely there, and those who
should be in the twenty fourth are here. Mister Data has been restored
to us, head and all, and Samuel Clemens will write the books he was to
have written after our encounter.
