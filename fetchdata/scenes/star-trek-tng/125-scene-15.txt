PICARD: Welcome aboard, Greg. 
QUINN: Good to see you. 
PICARD: You remember Commander Riker. 
QUINN: Hello again, Commander. 
PICARD: I must say, you're looking remarkably well. 
QUINN: Never felt better in my life. 
PICARD: When you were here last, you were saying that you were feeling
tired. 
QUINN: Tired of life I was, but not anymore. I'm ready for new
challenges now. What about another look at this ship?

[Corridor]

PICARD: Remember what you told me back at Relva
Seven, About the threat that you perceived to the very fabric of the
Federation? 
QUINN: Is that why you're here? Because of what I said? 
PICARD: It's one of the reasons, yes. 
QUINN: But Jean-Luc, you took me far too literally. I was only
referring to the problems involved in assimilating new races into the
Federation. It's an ongoing, tumultuous process which can cause stress
and strain on every aspect of our alliance. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood. 
QUINN: It's not for you to apologise. If I led you up the garden path,
I humbly ask your forgiveness. 
PICARD: Of course. 
QUINN: Now, gentlemen, you have a dinner to attend to, while I would
like to go and freshen up before I look around a little bit more. 
RIKER: We've arranged your usual accommodation, sir. 
QUINN: That's outstanding. 
PICARD: Yes, I should be getting down to the planet. Commander Riker
will be available here to show you anything that you want to see. 
QUINN: It's really not necessary. 
PICARD: I insist. (to Riker) When you've finished showing the Admiral
anything that he needs, you can join me down on Earth. 
QUINN: I may want to stay a while, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: Of course. Stay as long as you wish. (Quinn goes on) No.

PICARD: It's not Gregory Quinn. It may look like
him and sound like him, but it isn't him. 
RIKER: Are you absolutely certain, Captain? 
PICARD: I'm certain, Number One. I want you to stay close. Keep your
eye on his every move. Have Beverly concoct some reason for giving him
a full medical examination. 
RIKER: How? 
PICARD: I don't know, just do it. 
RIKER: He's a senior Admiral. 
PICARD: It's not him, Will. I know that now. What I have to find out is
how this happened, and who or what is behind it. 
RIKER: Captain, if you're right. 
PICARD: I'm right. 
RIKER: Should you be beaming down there alone, unarmed? 
PICARD: I'll take care. Find out what you can, then join me, in force
if necessary. Energise. 
RIKER: Good luck, sir.
