[Rex's Bar]

PICARD: You said you had responsibilities. What
exactly did you mean? 
MADELINE: You know about my mother's cousin, the girl from San Antonio
I told you about? 
(There's a shadow at the door) 
MADELINE: Jimmy. 
(Enter Data in costume, and Riker in uniform) 
REX: I'm as jumpy as Haircut Lapinski trying to land on a fraction. 
RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Captain. 
REX: Captain? 
PICARD: Call me Dix. 
RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Dix, but our two passengers have awakened. 
PICARD: Then it's time for me to go. 
MADELINE: What about Jimmy Cuzzo? You can't leave Rex to face him
alone. 
PICARD: I'll be back before Jimmy Cuzzo arrives. I guarantee it will be
taken care of. Just relax. 
REX: Your friends've got time for one drink, haven't they, Dix? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates.
This is Nails, from Chicago. And this is 
DATA: Carlos. 
PICARD: From South America. This is Madeline, my secretary, and I want
you to meet Rex. You know, I don't think I ever heard your last name? 
REX: Hm. Don't think I have one. Just Rex, that's all. So, fellas, tell
me your troubles. 
RIKER: Well, troubles. We've got some, Captain. It seems that a certain
woman, both wealthy and beautiful, now thinks that that she's going to
marry me. 
REX: She's got looks and bucks? Sounds like you've got yourself a heck
of a deal.

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: My fianc just has to see how I look in
this. Come along, Homn.

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: Hello, computer? Is Commander Riker still
on the Bridge? 
COMPUTER: Negative. Riker is currently in holodeck three. 
LWAXANA: Holodeck? Where is that? 
COMPUTER: Follow the comm. panel lights. They will lead you there.

[Rex's Bar]

REX: Good God, what's that? 
(Lwaxana and Homn enter) 
REX: I'll bet that's the broad with the big bucks. Come on over here,
darlin'. I got the best stool in the house saved for you. 
LWAXANA: So, this is where you've been hiding, Jean-Luc. I'm surprised
you let this part of the ship get this dirty. Oh, relax, Commander.
You've been making your true feelings quite clear. Obviously you feel
unable to handle me. 
REX: Anyway, why would a beautiful high-class lady like yourself want
to hook up with a mug like that? You're too good for him, if you ask
me. 
LWAXANA: You are a very interesting person. 
REX: You're not so bad yourself. In fact, you're as much class as this
joint's ever seen. Here. On the house. It's French. Almost. 
LWAXANA: This is the most remarkable man. I have never met anyone quite
like him. 
PICARD: I don't suppose you have. 
LWAXANA: He's strong. I get no thoughts from him at all. Nothing. I've
never known a man so able to keep his true feelings completely hidden. 
PICARD: That's because 
LWAXANA: No man has ever been such a mystery to me. I usually know
their thoughts before they do. 
REX: But not with me, huh? 
LWAXANA: No. And I never realised how erotic that could be. Carry my
beverage to that table. We have some things to discuss. 
RIKER: Should we tell her? 
PICARD: I think it would be only fair. But let's allow her the moment.
