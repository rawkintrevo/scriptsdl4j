[Transporter Room]

RIKER: Move! 
TASHA: We're too late. She's growing cold. 
CRUSHER: Sorry, that clashes with my instructions. 
(She injects Yareena) 
TASHA: Oh no. No.

[Centreplace]

PICARD: Exactly what do you find unfair, Lutan?
They fought to the death. You saw the final blow. You know
the effects of your poison. 
LUTAN: But what of your Lieutenant Yar? She is to become my First One
now. 
PICARD: I certainly won't stop her, if she cares to claim that honour. 
HAGON: Remember, you now have all Yareena's lands and wealth now. 
LUTAN: At least all has not been lost. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
RIKER [OC]: Since you've fulfilled your agreement, Captain, can we now
beam the vaccine aboard? 
LUTAN: Ah, yes, of course. 
PICARD: No problem, Number One. Send down a medical team. 
RIKER [OC]: And to complete our business here, we are locked onto you. 
PICARD: Five to beam up. Energise.

First Officer's log, Stardate 41235.6. I am
returning the conn to Captain Picard as we begin loading the vaccine
supply aboard. Shortly, we hope to signal mission complete.

(Picard, Troi, Lutan and Hagon enter) 
RIKER: Welcome back, Captain. You're wanted in the lounge. 
PICARD: This way, gentlemen.
