past biospectral tube commander high expect problem haven panel

[Jefferies tube]

(a panel has been eaten by acid or something) 
BARCLAY: Here we are. Looks like a conduit ruptured. No problem, I'll
just bypass it. 
LAFORGE: Reg, wait a second here. Take a look at these corroded edges
here. It looks like something has dissolved the bulkhead and eaten
right through the conduit. There are high levels of cholic acid here.
Enzymatic agents. You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that solvent was
organic. 
BARCLAY: Maybe we should run a biospectral analysis on the solvent.
Take a closer look. 
LAFORGE: That's a very good idea, but first we should take a break. 
BARCLAY: You go ahead, sir. I'll take care of it.

DERN: (at the helm) Commander, we received a
communication from Starfleet. They wanted to know when they could
expect your performance analysis of the new weapon systems. 
RIKER: The weapon systems? 
DERN: Yes, sir. The ones we've been testing for the past few days? 
RIKER: That's right. 
DERN: What should I tell them, sir? 
RIKER: Tell them, tell them we haven't finished yet.
