[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I have re-established contact with the
away team. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Beam them back immediately. 
DATA: Captain. 
(The Yamato fades and comes back)

[USS Yamato - Bridge]

RIKER: Come in. Come in, Enterprise. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Hold position, away team. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I've got you. We're bringing you home.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, hurry! 
HASKELL: Captain, it's almost gone.
(O'Brien gets them safely back and Riker hurried up to the Bridge)
RIKER: What the hell is going on? 
PICARD: Are you all right, Number One? 
RIKER: I've had it. Let's put all this technology to work, figure out
what's going on, and get the hell out of here. 
(After he's calmed down a little) 
RIKER: A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a hole in space,
with no crew aboard. Now what is the purpose? 
DATA: Add to it an attack by a nonexistent Romulan vessel. It does
suggest an interesting question. Was our away team actually over there?

RIKER: If we weren't over there, where the hell were we? 
HASKELL: Commander, I have re-established the star fix. 
RIKER: Great. Set course. Velocity warp two. 
HASKELL: Course and speed set. 
PICARD: Engage. 
DATA: I have lost contact, sir. 
PICARD: What? 
HASKELL: The star fix is gone. 
DATA: Captain, it is not in the same sector, but another opening has
appeared. 
PICARD: All right. Set a course for those stars, warp six. 
HASKELL: Yes, sir. Warp six. 
DATA: I've lost the signal, sir. 
RIKER: What's going on? 
PICARD: All stop. 
DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Data, I can see it. 
RIKER: This game is now wearing very thin. 
PICARD: Let's just hold this position. Counsellor? You have said you
sensed no intelligence in all of this. You haven't changed in that
belief? 
TROI: I'm not certain of that now, Captain. I do sense something
unusual. 
PICARD: Perhaps a different level of consciousness? 
TROI: Yes. Perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me. 
PULASKI: Rats in a maze. 
TROI: Exactly! 
PICARD: Explain. 
PULASKI: Everything we've been through reminds me of a laboratory
experiment. As if something was testing our responses to stimuli. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting that we're in some kind of laboratory? 
PULASKI: Yes. 
HASKELL: The opening seems closer, Captain. 
PICARD: I've had enough of being led about this way. 
RIKER: Agreed, Captain. Hold present position. 
TROI: Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity. 
(A face appears in the void) 
WORF: Captain, look. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Why are you so alarmed when I've gone to such
trouble to look just like you? 
DATA: Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. 
LAFORGE: Sure is a damned ugly nothing. 
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Can
you identify whoever or whatever you are? 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Nagilum. 
LAFORGE: Speaks right up for something your sensors say isn't there,
Data. 
PICARD: We still have no idea what you represent. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Data. 
DATA: Nagilum? 
NAGILUM: You are of different construction than the others.
Interesting. Picard, Riker, Geordi, Haskell. What are you? Your
construction also differs. 
(Pulaski is suddenly whipped around like a puppet on a string) 
PULASKI: My construction? 
DATA: Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor? 
PULASKI: Yes, well, there are minor differences. I'm what we call a
female. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: I understand. The masculine and the feminine. 
PICARD: It is the way in which we propagate our species. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Please, demonstrate how this is accomplished. 
PULASKI: Not likely. 
PICARD: Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. 
WORF: Let me put up the shields, sir. 
DATA: Sensors still show nothing out there. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Your life form surprises me more and more. Is
it true you also have only a limited existence? Answer! 
PICARD: What information do you want? I don't understand the question. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: You exist and then you cease to exist. Your
minds call it death. 
(Haskell starts to shake, holds his head and screams before suffering
the fate usually reserved for red shirts) 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: How interesting. 
PULASKI: He's gone. 
PICARD: We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: To understand death, I must amass information
on every aspect of it. Every kind of dying. The experiments shouldn't
take more than a third of your crew, maybe half.

Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that
whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life form. How do we
fight something that both is and is not there?

[Observation lounge]

TROI: I know this much. We are unimportant to it. 
WORF: In a battle for survival, Captain, thirty to fifty percent
casualties 
PULASKI: Would be appalling. 
WORF: But within acceptable limits. 
RIKER: This is not a battle, Worf. 
TROI: No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. 
PICARD: Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum? 
TROI: No. 
DATA: All evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what it
proposes. 
PICARD: Agreed. Under the circumstances, I think there is only one
decision. I will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered. 
DATA: Sir. I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it.

PICARD: Yes, there is 
PULASKI: What? 
PICARD: Destroy the Enterprise. 
PULASKI: Isn't that a little like curing the disease by killing the
patient? 
RIKER: It's better than standing around helplessly. 
PULASKI: Why do get the feeling this was not the time to join this
ship?
