[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: Increasing power to the shields. 
(the ship starts taking pot-shots at them. at least one hits them) 
RIKER: Coming about. 
(Odan is thrown out of his seat and the shuttle is damaged) 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: We've lost port thrusters 
[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losing
control. 
PICARD [OC]: We're bringing you in. 
(the tractor beam grabs them and the other ship veers off) 
RIKER: Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up.
You can't tow us. You'd better beam us directly on board. 
ODAN: No, don't do it. 
RIKER: I can't stabilise the shuttle. 
ODAN: If you transport me, it will kill me. Please. 
PICARD [OC]: Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. 
RIKER: Belay that order, Captain. I'll bring her in manually. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Advise Doctor Crusher we have a medical
emergency.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He's in shock, he's lost a lot of blood,
but that still doesn't explain these readings. Eosinophilia in the
cerebrospinal fluid at forty six percent. 
OGAWA: Sedimentation rate is twenty nine, but his lymphocytes are still
intact. 
CRUSHER: It's as though there's a parasite at work. Odan, Odan. I need
to do exploratory surgery. You may have a parasitic infection. 
ODAN: You must not. 
CRUSHER: But you won't survive. 
(then she notices the movement in his abdomen) 
CRUSHER: What is that? 
ODAN: Beverly, that is me. 
CRUSHER: What? 
ODAN: This body is just a host. I am that parasite. That is what must
survive. It has always been this way. The Trill are a joined species. A
host and a symbiont, and in this fashion we have survived for
millennia. 
CRUSHER: You're dying. What can I do? 
ODAN: The host body is dying. You must contact the Trill quickly. Tell
them I need another host. They will send a replacement. I know this is
difficult to accept, but I beg you, Doctor Beverly, help me. This
mission must be completed.
