(Riker is hanging over Wesley's shoulder) 
RIKER: What is that? 
WESLEY: It's just a background fluctuation, Commander. He hasn't found
it yet. 
RIKER: Then he must be hurt or dead. When does our next window open up,
Mister Data? 
DATA: There is no indication, Commander. I have no way to predict. 
WORF: Incoming Romulan transmission, Captain. 
RIKER: They're early. 
DATA: The Romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away from
the edge of the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Close enough, however, to see we're not there. On screen. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Picard, I'm approaching the Federation border
and the Enterprise is not to be found. Why? 
PICARD: My away team is unable to leave the surface because of the
storms. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And my officer? 
PICARD: He is alive. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: His life remains in jeopardy? 
PICARD: Yes. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And yet you will still not permit me to cross
into your precious Federation space to retrieve him? 
PICARD: If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me make
it again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless they
are prepared to do battle. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: But a mission of mercy? 
PICARD: A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caught
on a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I have already explained. 
PICARD: And I have rejected your explanation. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Territories! You would measure territories
against a man's life? 
PICARD: Commander, I am singularly impressed by your concern for a
life. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picard
out.

LAFORGE: Bochra. Bochra, you're in bad shape and my
vision's getting worse. Now there's a beacon out there that'll get us
back to my ship, but not if I can't find it. 
BOCHRA: I cannot surrender to the Federation. 
LAFORGE: Then stay here and die. 
BOCHRA: If the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid
capture? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I might, if I thought it was necessary. If the
stakes were high enough. But they'd have to be pretty damn high. I
guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan, huh? 
BOCHRA: I no more wish to die than you do. 
LAFORGE: Bochra, there are times when it is necessary to die for one's
ideals. Do you believe this is one of those times? 
(Bochra puts down the phaser) 
LAFORGE: Come on. Let's go find that beacon. Whoa! 
BOCHRA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: Everything's gone blank. I'm blind.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come. Worf. 
WORF: You are busy. Forgive my intrusion. 
RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. 
WORF: With respect, sir, you cannot. I am asked to give up the very
lifeblood of my mother and my father to those who murdered them. 
RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? 
WORF: Yes. 
RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with the
Romulans. 
WORF: Impossible. 
RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Think
how many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here now
like this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame?
Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carry
the bitterness on another generation? 
WORF: Then you believe I should? 
RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. 
WORF: My Starfleet training tells me one thing, but everything I am
tells me another. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. 
WORF: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end.
I thought it important for you to see him again. It's not too late to
change your mind. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PATAHK: Come close to me, Klingon. Let me die with my hands at your
throat. 
WORF: There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive. 
PATAHK: Then you've come to hear me beg for my life? 
WORF: No. 
PATAHK: I would rather die than pollute my body with Klingon filth!

[Cave]

BOCHRA: I've lost almost all feeling in my legs. 
LAFORGE: My synapses must be turning to jelly. The Visor's fine. I just
can't see a thing. 
BOCHRA: How do we locate the beacon? 
LAFORGE: We don't. 
BOCHRA: Do all humans give up so easily? 
LAFORGE: Bochra, we're lost, unless you've got something that can smell
neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: We have the sensor device you are carrying. 
LAFORGE: Tricorder? It's not set up to detect neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: Your eye device does. Connect them. 
LAFORGE: That's crazy. They don't speak the same language. Besides, I'd
never be able to get an accurate sampling. Wait a second. Wait, I
wouldn't need an
accurate sampling, just need a pointer. A neutrino Geiger counter. No,
it's still not possible. 
BOCHRA: You cannot do it? 
LAFORGE: Under normal circumstances, maybe. Here, no way. 
BOCHRA: Why? 
LAFORGE: Because I can't see. Adapting the neural output pods of the
Visor is tricky work. It can't be done by touch. 
BOCHRA: Then I will be your eyes.

DATA: The storm is beginning to subside, Captain.
We should have a window in less than an hour. 
RIKER: There's still no indication that he's found the beacon, sir. 
PICARD: Assemble an away team. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
WORF: Captain, the Romulan warship has crossed the Neutral Zone border.
It is in Federation space and heading toward us. 
PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert.
