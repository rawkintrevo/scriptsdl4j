RIKER OBRIEN WORF PICARD SALIA WESLEY VOICE DATA ANYA

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I'm receiving an audio signal. 
PICARD: Audio on. 
VOICE [OC]: Come in Enterprise. This is Command Headquarters of Daled
Four. We have been expecting you. 
DATA: Sir, sensors indicate the communication originated from a
terawatt source on the planet. 
RIKER: That's more power than our entire ship can generate. 
DATA: It is what is needed to penetrate the atmosphere. 
RIKER: Which means we lack the ability to respond, sir. 
WORF: Sir, there are beam-down coordinates encoded within the carrier
signal. 
PICARD: Splendid. 
RIKER: I'll arrange for our guests to beam down.

[Corridor]

WORF: Forcefield off. 
[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Come in. 
WORF: We have arrived. 
ANYA: Salia will be with you in just a moment. 
(Worf leaves) 
SALIA: You're not going? 
ANYA: No. My duties have been completed. I have done all that I could.
I hope it was enough. 
SALIA: You've raised me well, and I thank you for that. 
ANYA: I would not have harmed the boy, I only wanted to frighten him. 
SALIA: I know. 
ANYA: You are ready for what awaits you and you will do well. I know
that I have been hard on you, but I wanted to prepare you for anything
you might be required to do. 
SALIA: Will I ever be able to leave Daled Four? 
ANYA: Probably not. But anything is possible. 
SALIA: That's what Wes said. 
ANYA: I hope he's right. 
SALIA: Where will you go? 
ANYA: The third moon is within range of this ship's transporter, I
shall go there. It was my home before we went away. 
SALIA: I'm going to miss you. 
ANYA: I know. 
(Salia goes to the door, and it opens) 
SALIA: I am ready now. 
(Salia leaves and Worf enters) 
WORF: I will escort you to transporter room six. 
ANYA: You will be happy to see me leave. 
WORF: No. You are a worthy opponent. 
ANYA: Thank you. At heart, we are very much alike. 
WORF: Yes, we are. 
ANYA: Perhaps we shall fight again. On the same side. 
WORF: It would be an honour. Shall we go? 
[Wesley's quarters]

WESLEY: Come in. 
SALIA: Wesley, I have to go now. 
WESLEY: Was it fun? 
SALIA: What do you mean? 
WESLEY: Playing humanoid. Was it fun? 
SALIA: Wesley, look at me. Right now, this minute, this is what I am. A
humanoid girl. 
WESLEY: What are you really? 
SALIA: Does it matter? 
WESLEY: Yes. 
SALIA: Our natural state is one unlike anything you can imagine. 
WESLEY: So you took this form for our benefit? That's why you wanted to
know what species we are. 
SALIA: I'm sorry I hurt you. I didn't mean to. 
WESLEY: I loved you. 
SALIA: I love you, too. 
WESLEY: Can you? 
SALIA: Yes, oh yes. I have the same feelings, the same emotions as you.
You must believe me. 
WESLEY: Please go. 
SALIA: Wesley, let's not say goodbye like this. 
(No reply, so she leaves him to nurse his broken heart)

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Prepare to beam Salia to the specified
coordinates. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
SALIA: Our world is grateful for the courtesy which you have extended
us. 
RIKER: I hope some day that the Federation and Daled Four will have
formal contact. 
SALIA: That is my wish as well. 
O'BRIEN: Coordinates have been input, sir. 
RIKER: Proceed. 
(Wesley enters with a dish of Thalian chocolate mousse) 
WESLEY: Wait. A taste to remember me by. 
SALIA: I wish there were something I could give you. 
WESLEY: You already have. 
SALIA: I'm glad you came to say goodbye. Thank you, for everything. 
SALIA: I want you to leave now. 
WESLEY: Why? 
SALIA: I cannot arrive on my planet in this form, and I want you to
remember me as I am now. 
WESLEY: Don't' worry, I will. 
(She turns into a shimmering column of light) 
WESLEY: Energise.
