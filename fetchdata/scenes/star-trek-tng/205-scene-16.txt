KEIKO CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF

[Cargo bay]

(they've moved the containers) 
CRUSHER: The levels are still rising. There must be some way to put
that fire out. 
LAFORGE: The energy's being fed by the ship's internal power grid and
we can't even get near that. The only way to stop it would be to
eliminate its supply of oxygen. Wait a minute. Doctor, I've got an
idea. It's kind or wild, but we just might be able to kill two birds
with one stone. 
CRUSHER: Let's hear it. 
LAFORGE: Okay. We open the external door. That would depressurise the
cargo bay and suck all of those containers out into space. At the same
time, the lack of oxygen should put out the plasma fire. 
CRUSHER: What about us? 
LAFORGE: We just need to find something in here to hold onto while the
air is evacuating. Then, we close the door, repressurise the bay. 
CRUSHER: What about this? 
(a ladder up to the second level) 
LAFORGE: Yeah, that ought to do it.

[Ten Forward]

(Keiko is doing some bandages) 
KEIKO: There that should do it. 
WORF: (to man with broken leg) There will be a sharp pain as I set the
bone. Prepare yourself. Good. Good, you bore that well. 
(Keiko gasps) 
WORF: Keiko? 
KEIKO: I'm all right. I think. 
WORF: Perhaps you should lie down. 
KEIKO: Oh, oh, oh. I'm having contractions. 
WORF: I believe that is not uncommon in the late months of pregnancy. 
KEIKO: No, I mean contractions. I'm going into labour. 
WORF: You cannot. This this is not a good time, Keiko. 
KEIKO: It's not open for debate. Like it or not, this baby is coming.
