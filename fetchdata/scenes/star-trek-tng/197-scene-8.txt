TROI WOMAN ODAN LAFORGE PICARD TAGGART CRUSHER

[Beauty parlour]

(Beverly is getting her toenails coloured, while
soaking her hands in green gunk and with a padded eye-shade on) 
WOMAN: Hi, Deanna. 
TROI: Hi. Is that the colgonite astringent you have on your eyes? 
CRUSHER: Yes. I guess so. 
TROI: I've never tried it. 
CRUSHER: Someone just put it on me. 
TROI: I didn't know you even came in here. 
CRUSHER: I don't. At least, not very often. 
TROI: But it feels good to indulge yourself sometimes. 
CRUSHER: I guess so. 
TROI: Especially when you haven't done so in a while. 
CRUSHER: What is that supposed to mean? 
TROI: Beverly, you're in love. 
CRUSHER: Sometimes I wish you weren't so empathic 
TROI: I don't really think it's really a secret. 
CRUSHER: It isn't? 
TROI: You've been glowing. 
CRUSHER: Oh. Must be the astringent. What? 
TROI: Nothing. 
CRUSHER: Oh, yes, there is. What is it? 
TROI: It's just something I sense in Odan. 
CRUSHER: What? What do you sense? 
TROI: It's just, how well do you really know him? 
CRUSHER: I feel I know him better than I've known anyone in my life. Am
I being foolish? I don't think so. And yet, I've only known him for a
couple of weeks. Of course, that could be infatuation, but I am a grown
up and I know the difference between love and infatuation. All I know
is, I haven't felt this way for a long time. 
TROI: And you like it. 
CRUSHER: I like it.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
ODAN: You wanted to see me, Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, Ambassador. Please, sit down. We have entered orbit. We
shall be transporting you to the planet in a few minutes. 
ODAN: I am ready, Captain. 
PICARD: How will you proceed when you're there? 
ODAN: Oh, I cannot answer that. I never know until I am into the
situation, meet the people involved. I work very much by instinct, not
by pre-arranged plan. 
PICARD: It seems to work well for you. 
ODAN: Well, I do like to go into a situation as well-informed as
possible, and I must say that your staff has been quite helpful in
briefing me on the problems down here. Particularly Doctor Crusher. 
PICARD: My staff is quite capable. I'm glad they've been useful. 
ODAN: Your Doctor Beverly is an extraordinary person, both as a
scientist and as a woman. 
PICARD: Yes, I'm sure that's true. Well, shall we make our way to the
shuttlebay? 
ODAN: Captain, you know her better than I. Do you have any idea how
committed she is to remaining with Starfleet? 
PICARD: I wouldn't presume to speak for her. 
ODAN: Oh no, of course not. I just thought, well, you've known her so
much long than I. 
TAGGART [OC]: Ensign Taggart to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Ensign. 
TAGGART [OC]: The shuttle is ready to transport the Ambassador. 
PICARD: Very well. 
ODAN: I'll find my own way, Captain. I hope to return with good news.

[Shuttlebay]

LAFORGE: Commander Riker has asked to pilot you
himself, Ambassador. 
ODAN: I am honoured. 
(he embraces Beverly) 
ODAN: I don't know when I'll be back. 
CRUSHER: I know. Have a safe trip. 
ODAN: I will stay safe, Doctor Beverly. I have good reason to return.
I've researched Earth customs. This flower is given to express love. 
(a single red rose) 
CRUSHER: Yes, it is.
