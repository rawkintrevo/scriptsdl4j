(Maylor is laid out) 
PICARD: You wanted to see me, Doctor?
CRUSHER: Yes, Captain. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a little
concerned. I haven't been able to determine the cause of death. She was
elderly. and Alkar said she had been ill, but I found no evidence of
any disease. I did find abnormally high levels of neurotransmitter
residue in her cerebral cortex.
PICARD: What are you suggesting?
CRUSHER: I'd like to do an autopsy. I've already spoken to Alkar, and
he informs me that Lumerian custom forbids it. Could you speak with him?
PICARD: Do you suspect that her death poses some kind of threat to the
Enterprise?
CRUSHER: Well, no.
PICARD: Then we have no alternative but to concur with his wishes.
