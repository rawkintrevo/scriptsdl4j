DATA: How did the Conductor stop the train? 
WORF: There is a braking lever in the engine room. 
TROI: Let's go. 
RUSTIC: Sorry, folks, but you ain't going nowhere.

LAFORGE: I've narrowed the search to the MacPherson
Nebula, which is a supernova remnant, and Dikon Alpha, which is a class
nine pulsar. They're both fairly close to our current flight path and
either one could produce vertion particles if we detonated a modified
photon torpedo inside it. 
RIKER: Vertions usually occur in miniscule amounts. Do you think either
of these phenomena could produce enough of them? 
LAFORGE: It's really hard to say. I can't even guarantee that we can
create them at all. 
PICARD: Well, we've got to give it a try. The nebula or the pulsar?
It's your choice, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: I say go with the nebula. 
PICARD: Very well. Begin the torpedo modifications. 
RIKER: Now let's see if we can get this ship to go where we want.

[Holodeck- train]

TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what's
happening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want to
help you get there. 
RUSTIC: Well, I don't know. 
TROI: Please, we're your friends. 
RUSTIC: You're really going to help get us to New Vertiform City? 
TROI: I promise. 
RUSTIC: Okay. But just one of you. The rest stay here.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: That's far enough. 
GANGSTER: Sorry to spoil your party, pal. It's nothing personal. 
DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. 
GANGSTER: Don't listen to him. He's up to somethin'. 
CONDUCTOR: A shorter route? 
DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls. 
GANGSTER: Don't do it. 
CONDUCTOR: Well we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there
on time. All right, go on, but no funny stuff. 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by. Are we within sensor range of the
nebula? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain, we are. 
PICARD: Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed. 
[Holodeck - Engine room]

DATA: I will attempt to do so. 
CONDUCTOR: I hope you know what you're doing. 
(Data closes a valve and pulls on the brake)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Are the modifications to the torpedoes
complete? 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Launch torpedo. 
(whoosh, KaBOOM) 
LAFORGE: It's working, Captain. The reaction is producing vertion
particles. 
[Holodeck Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Well, what do you know? We're here. 
GANGSTER: New Vertiform City.
