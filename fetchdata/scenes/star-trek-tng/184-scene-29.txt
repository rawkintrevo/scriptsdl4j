[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: How are you feeling? 
TROI: Beverly, I can't do my job. I'm absolutely lost. You have to do
something. 
CRUSHER: I cross-referenced your scan results with the baseline files
in the computer. Nothing helpful has turned up. And so far the lab work
is inconclusive. 
TROI: Inconclusive. What does that mean? 
CRUSHER: It means there is nothing I can do now. I am still trying. 
TROI: How do you people live like this? 
CRUSHER: We get by pretty well, actually. And so will you, in time. 
TROI: You have no idea. No idea what this is like. How can you know
what it's like to lose something you never had? 
CRUSHER: I don't claim to. 
TROI: And yet you're telling me I'm supposed to get used to it. 
CRUSHER: If our positions were reversed, what would you tell me? 
TROI: If our positions were reversed, I wouldn't have been in here
treating skinned elbows while you were lying passed out on your office
floor. I'd have been there a lot sooner. Perhaps in time to prevent
this from ever happening! 
(Deanna storms off to her own quarters and marches in, fists clenched.
There is a defenceless glass table
expecting to get smashed, but instead she sinks to her knees)

[Ready room]

TROI: I've been working with Ensign Brooks since
the death of her husband. She's
avoided the reality of what happened, denied it to herself, and I
realise I've been doing the same thing about my condition. 
PICARD: That's perfectly understandable. 
TROI: It's time I accept the truth, Captain, and resign as ship's
counsellor. 
PICARD: Resign? 
TROI: I can no longer fulfill my obligations. What other option is
there? 
PICARD: Deanna, I've been fortunate to have access to your Betazoid
abilities. Most starship captains have to be content with a human
counsellor. Empathic awareness is not a requirement of your position. 
TROI: It is for me. 
PICARD: I'm sure that after a while you'll be able to adjust. They say
when one loses a sense, the other senses become stronger to compensate.
A blind man develops better hearing. 
TROI: With all due respect, Captain, you don't know what you're talking
about. That is a common belief with no scientific basis, no doubt
created by normal people who felt uncomfortable around the disabled. I
am disabled, and I'm telling you I cannot perform my duties. 
PICARD: There was a teacher of mine at the Academy who had been
confined to a wheelchair since birth. She was a woman 
TROI: Captain, spare me the inspirational anecdote and just accept my
resignation.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. 
(Riker enters) 
TROI: I really would rather be alone right now. 
RIKER: Too bad. 
(he pulls her towards him, and she cries in his arms) 
TROI: Is this how you handle all of your personnel problems? 
RIKER: Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or
Worf. 
TROI: Will, I don't know what to do. 
RIKER: So you resign? You walk away from all the people who care about
you? 
TROI: I look around me and all I see are surfaces without depth.
Colourless. Hollow. Nothing seems real. 
RIKER: I'm real. 
TROI: No, you're not. You're a projection, with no more substance to me
than a character on the holodeck. 
RIKER: I don't believe that. 
TROI: You have no idea how frightening it is to just be here without
sensing you, without sharing your feelings. 
RIKER: That's it, isn't it? We're on equal footing now. 
TROI: What? 
RIKER: You always had an advantage. A little bit of control of every
situation. That must have been a very safe position to be in. To be
honest, I'd always thought there was something a little too
aristocratic about your Betazoid heritage. As if your human side wasn't
quite good enough for you. 
TROI: That isn't true. 
RIKER: Isn't it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Riker. 
RIKER: Go ahead, Geordi.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We are ready to attempt a controlled
overload jump to warp six.

[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge.
I'll check in on you later. 
TROI: Really, you don't have to. 
RIKER: I will check in on you later.

[Bridge]

ALLENBY: Setting a new course at optimal shearing
angle. Bearing two one seven mark two zero three. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Engaging impulse 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Engines now.
