RIKER WORF TROI DERN OGAWA CRUSHER NURSE

[Bridge]

DERN: (at the helm) Commander, we received a
communication from Starfleet. They wanted to know when they could
expect your performance analysis of the new weapon systems. 
RIKER: The weapon systems? 
DERN: Yes, sir. The ones we've been testing for the past few days? 
RIKER: That's right. 
DERN: What should I tell them, sir? 
RIKER: Tell them, tell them we haven't finished yet. 
[Troi's quarters]

(Troi is in a bath, fully clothed, when Worf
enters) 
TROI: What are you doing here? 
WORF: I had to be near you. 
TROI: Computer, increase temperature by five degrees. 
WORF: Get out of that water now. 
TROI: Leave me alone! 
(Worf grabs her arm and bites her on the cheek)

[Sickbay]

TROI: Can I have a glass of water? It's so cold in
here. 
CRUSHER: Your temperature has dropped almost eight degrees. I want to
run a hypothalamic series right away. 
OGAWA: Doctor, we've had three other crewmembers complaining about the
temperature levels. Some feel like they have fevers, others are
freezing like Counsellor Troi. 
CRUSHER: Call Doctor Selar and Doctor Hacopian. It looks like we've got
some sort of viral infection going on around here. I want to check on
Lieutenant Worf. 
(at another bed, Worf is under guard) 
CRUSHER: Worf, have you had any unusual symptoms lately? Headaches,
nausea, dizziness? Worf? Worf, do you hear me? I going to run a full
bioscan. I want you to lie down. (he doesn't move.) Okay, we can do
this sitting up. What is this? (a growth on his
jaw line) Worf, how long have you had this on your neck? It looks like
it's full of some bioacidic compound, almost like a venom sac. Worf,
open your mouth. 
(Worf opens his mouth and sprays venom into Beverly's face. She
collapses, screaming in pain and Worf escapes) 
OGAWA: Get a hypospray. 
NURSE: Right away.
