DATA: There's limited information available on
Pakled culture, but the eclectic range of their equipment suggests
their technology was borrowed from others. 
TROI: And now they have become militant. 
DATA: So it would seem. 
RIKER: Rationale? 
TROI: They are unwilling to wait for the timely evolution of their
species' intellectual capacity. They want instant knowledge, instant
power and gratification. 
PULASKI: The more they get, the more they want. 
RIKER: And the more aggressive and dangerous they become. I think it's
time we set some limits. 
DATA: To what effect, sir? We are faced with an impossible conundrum. 
RIKER: Suppose we turn their impatience and greed against them? 
PULASKI: But how? 
RIKER: Perhaps Geordi should give them something they want. Something
important. Then we simply create the right moment for him to take it
away, and get him the hell out of there. 
TROI: Would you be suggesting a ruse of some sort? 
RIKER: I would. 
PULASKI: But what if we fail? What'll happen to Geordi then? 
RIKER: We have no other choice. We have to try.

SURGEON: There's been some capillary reaction here.
Let's proceed carefully. We'll need sharper focus on the thoracic
polychromatics and verification of myocardial enzyme balance.

LAFORGE: Let me talk to them. I'll get you their
computer banks. 
GREBNEDLOG: We want to be smart. 
LAFORGE: So open the hailing frequency. They'll listen to me. 
GREBNEDLOG: We are smart. 
REGINOD: We need their computer things. 
GREBNEDLOG: Yes. Yes.

(Geordi is suffering, and holding his side) 
LAFORGE: Hey, let me talk to him. I'll get you their computer banks. 
GREBNEDLOG: We want to be smart. 
LAFORGE: So open the hailing frequency. They'll listen to me. 
GREBNEDLOG: We are smart. 
REGINOD: We need their computer things. 
GREBNEDLOG: Yes. Yes.
