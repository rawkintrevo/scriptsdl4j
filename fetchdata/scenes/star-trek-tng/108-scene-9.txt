[Sickbay]

(Work is on a bed, with Beverly tending to him,
when blue energy comes out of him, up her arms. She sags, then Troi
enters) 
TROI: He's reading normal now. How did you manage that? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Normal. 
TROI: Are you all right? 
CRUSHER: Yes, perfectly. Both of us. Quite normal now. 
(Worf wakes suddenly) 
WORF: What? Where am I? 
TROI: Don't you remember? You were in the sensor maintenance room. 
WORF: I remember monitoring the sensor console. What am I doing here? 
TROI: That's a story the Doctor will tell you. 
(But Crusher walks out)

[Bridge]

(At a rear science station) 
PICARD: Obviously you feel it's something we should look at more
carefully. 
DATA: A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated,
sir. 
PICARD: I love a mystery, Data, but this one will have to to wait until
we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament. Time
and tide, Lieutenant La Forge. Go to warp eight. 
LAFORGE: Warp eight, sir. 
[Crusher's quarters]

WESLEY: Him Mom. You're back early. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
(She looks at the computer monitor he's studying) 
WESLEY: Physical sciences class. We're studying Doctor Channing's
theory on dilithium crystals. 
CRUSHER: Tell me about it. 
WESLEY: Really? You never seemed that interested in warp theory before.
Doctor Channing thinks it's possible to force dilithium into even more
useful crystals. If as shown here, matter and antimatter could be
aligned even more efficiently 
CRUSHER: Would that affect navigation? 
WESLEY: This is engineering, not helm control. 
CRUSHER: Oh yes, the helm's located on the Bridge. 
(Beverly leaves) 
WESLEY: Mom, is something wrong?
