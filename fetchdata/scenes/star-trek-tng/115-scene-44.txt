solemn double medical proven course forge gave best told

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We're going to be seriously undermanned if
we're forced to engage the Romulans in battle. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: The Romulans are your problem, Lieutenant.
Trying to find an inoculants
is mine. This virus mutates every twenty minutes. But so far we haven't
had any fatalities, yet. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: If this continues, there'll be no one left
to run the ship. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: If this continues, Lieutenant La Forge, no
one will be healthy enough to care. 
[Bridge]

TASHA: [OC]: Yar to Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Enterprise here. Go ahead. 
[Hideout]

TASHA: Prepare to beam three to our previous
location, Geordi. After re-grouping with Commander Riker, we'll return
to the ship. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I suggest you make that on the double,
Tasha. We have a real medical emergency brewing up here. 
[Hideout]

LAFORGE [OC]: One third of the crew is down, and
the latest information from the Neutral Zone outpost is that more
Romulan vessels are converging on that area. 
TASHA: I'll inform the Commander. Yar out. One thing before we go. You
said you were expecting us. Why? 
RAMSEY: I can't answer that. 
TROI: We wish you well, Mister Ramsey. 
TASHA: Energise. 
(The three beam away) 
RAMSEY: They're gone. 
(Ariel comes out and embraces him)

[Beata's quarters]

BEATA: What a refreshing change to be with a man
who knows what he wants.
RIKER: And doesn't have to be told by a woman? 
BEATA: Exactly. I knew you were bright enough to understand. You see,
women, by our very nature, want only what is best for their men. 
RIKER: Men are not objects to be possessed, Mistress Beata. 
BEATA: Of course they're not. It was merely a figure of speech. 
(Doorbell. She rolls over and turns off the meditation crystal and gets
up.) 
BEATA: Enter. 
(Trent comes in) 
BEATA: What is so important you find it necessary to intrude upon my
privacy? 
TRENT: They have returned, Mistress, but without Ramsey or the others. 
(Tasha, Troi and Data enter) 
BEATA: Your advanced technology has proven inadequate? 
RIKER: What happened, Tasha? 
TROI: Mister Ramsey and the other survivors refuse to leave. 
BEATA: You gave me your solemn word. 
RIKER: I'm sorry, there's nothing else we can do. 
BEATA: I'm sorry as well. Since you refuse to take them with you, I am
left with no choice but to sentence them all to death.
