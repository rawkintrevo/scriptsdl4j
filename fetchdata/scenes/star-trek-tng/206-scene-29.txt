(Wesley takes off his comm. badge and dashes out)

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to Bridge. We lost Crusher. It
appears he rigged a site-to-site transport. 
PICARD: Security alert, condition three. Computer, shut down all
transporter systems and shuttlebays. Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: I can't track him, sir. He's done something to the internal
security sensors. I'll try bypassing his subcommands. Hold on. I'm
picking up a piece of his trail, sir. Sensors show power activation in
transporter room three. That would put him somewhere on deck six. 
PICARD: Seal off deck six. Activate security fields sections twenty
three through twenty nine. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

(Wesley stops at a junction, and sets a hand phaser
to send pulses of energy at the forcefield generator before ducking
down a side corridor)

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We've got him, Captain. Section twenty
five. It looks like he's trying to cut through the forcefield with a
phaser. 
PICARD: Security to deck six, section twenty five. 
SECURITY [OC]: On our way.
