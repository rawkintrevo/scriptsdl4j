GLEASON WORF SHELBY RIKER WESLEY DATA

[Bridge]

SHELBY: Acknowledged. Fire antimatter spread.

(Picard watches the lovely fireworks display,
trying to figure it out)

[Shuttlecraft]

DATA: Shuttle launch sequence confirmed. Departing
Enterprise in exactly three seconds.

[Borg ship]

[Battle bridge]

WESLEY: The Borg tractor beam has moved toward the
antimatter spread.
GLEASON: They might be picking up engine ionisation from the shuttle 
RIKER: Data, cut your engines. Take her in unpowered. 
[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Shuttle has penetrated the Borg
electromagnetic field. 
RIKER [OC]: Understood. 
DATA: The shuttle escape transporter should provide enough power to
beam us 
[Battle bridge]

DATA [OC]: Onto the Borg ship from here, sir 
RIKER: Proceed.

[Borg ship]

(Worf and Data materialise, and head towards Picard
the Borg. They each shoot two drones before Worf goes hand to hand with
Picard. Data shoots a third drone) 
WORF: Data! 
(Borg Picard is easily as strong as Worf. Data does something to the
back of Picard's neck to knock him out, then all three beam back aboard
the shuttlecraft)

[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Mission accomplished. We have him. 
DATA: Firing shuttle thrusters. 
(The shuttlecraft goes back out through the Borg shield)

[Battle bridge]

WESLEY: They're clear of the Borg field, sir. 
RIKER: Beam them out of there, Mister O'Brien.
