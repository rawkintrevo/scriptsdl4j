Q CRUSHER AMANDA

[Amanda's quarters]

AMANDA: You understand, don't you? It's just that I
have these things that I want to do. I'm going to the Academy. I want a
career, and I want to join Starfleet. 
CRUSHER: You can still do those things. 
AMANDA: It just seems so complicated now. These powers that I have are
just going to stand in the way. I don't want to have to deal with it. 
CRUSHER: Well, you're going to have to. Listen, I can only imagine how
you feel. And it would be easier if this had never happened or if it
would just go away. But it's not going to go away. And you need someone
to help you. And the person who can help you is Q. 
AMANDA: He's so horrible. 
CRUSHER: He is the only one who can help you to understand who you are.
Amanda, you are going to have to make some hard choices about your
future, and you can't make them if you're going to ignore the truth. 
AMANDA: Yeah. I know. But I don't want any of this to disrupt my time
here. I want to do everything that I'm expected to do, and I don't want
you to treat me any differently. Please? 
CRUSHER: You've got a deal. The first free hour you have, I want to see
you in the medical lab. I have an experiment I need help with. 
AMANDA: Yes, ma'am.

Q [OC]: Your progress, Q? 
Q: As anticipated, there are some problems. I need time. However, there
is a possibility we won't have to terminate her.
