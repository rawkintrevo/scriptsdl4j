[Crusher's quarters]

(Beverly's playing the game at high level, and
getting a lot of pleasure from it) 
WESLEY: Mom? 
CRUSHER: Wesley. 
WESLEY: What are you doing? 
CRUSHER: I'm embarrassed to say. This was meant for you. But it was so
much fun, I couldn't resist. 
WESLEY: What is it? 
CRUSHER: It's a game. Riker brought it back from Risa. Everybody's
playing it. Want to try? 
WESLEY: Maybe later. How's Data? 
CRUSHER: Geordi's still working on him. He's going to be fine. 
WESLEY: I think I should go give him a hand. 
CRUSHER: No. Wesley, you are on vacation. You have done enough already.

WESLEY: Yeah, maybe you're right. Computer, increase light level. 
CRUSHER: Are you in a hurry? 
WESLEY: Yeah, I'm late for a dinner date. 
CRUSHER: Really. With who? 
WESLEY: Robin Lefler from Engineering. 
CRUSHER: Why don't you invite her here? We can all play the game
together. I can replicate a couple more. 
WESLEY: Mom. 
CRUSHER: Sorry. It's just that I want to spend some time together while
you're here. 
WESLEY: We'll have time together. I promise. 
CRUSHER: Okay. 
WESLEY: Okay. 
CRUSHER: Just one game. Come on, try it on for size. 
WESLEY: Mom! I really need to get ready. 
CRUSHER: Have a good time. 
WESLEY: Thanks. I will.

[Ten Forward]

ROBIN: When your parents are the only plasma
specialists in the sector, you do a lot of travelling around. We went
from base to base to base. I felt like a piece of luggage after a
while. I spent all of my time around technical gear. My first friend
was a tricorder. 
WESLEY: Really? My very first friend was a warp coil. 
ROBIN: My parents work came first. They didn't really have time for me,
even when I needed them. So that's how I learned my first law. Law One.
You can only count on yourself. 
WESLEY: Sounds kind of lonely. Well, now you're here. 
ROBIN: Now I'm here. 
WESLEY: Well, I'm glad. 
ROBIN: You wouldn't believe what's going on in Engineering. Commander
La Forge and all the others, they're crazy about some new game. 
WESLEY: Yeah, what kind of game is it? 
ROBIN: It's some Risian gadget that fits over your ear. 
WESLEY: Have you played it? 
ROBIN: Not yet. 
WESLEY: My mom has one. She keeps trying to get me to play it. 
ROBIN: It's everywhere. 
(a crewwoman on a seat by the window is totally lost in the game) 
ROBIN: See what I mean? 
WESLEY: Don't you think that's a little strange? Everybody playing it
all the time. 
ROBIN: It's just a fad. It's here this week. Next week we won't even
know it existed. 
WESLEY: I wonder how it works? 
ROBIN: Why don't you try it and find out? 
WESLEY: I'd like to know a little bit more about it before I try it. 
ROBIN: I bet if we worked together we could figure it out. 
WESLEY: Yeah, we could hook it up to one of the computers. The medical
programs in the lab can be set up to emulate human responses. 
ROBIN: I noticed it uses a visual interface. We could connect it
through an optical sensor.
