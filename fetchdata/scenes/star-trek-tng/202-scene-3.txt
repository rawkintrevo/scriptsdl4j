RIKER WORF PICARD TAMARIAN DATA DATHON

[Planet surface]

(birds are twittering, the meadow flowers are tall.
Dathon is holding the two daggers at arms length) 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad. 
PICARD: You want to fight with me? Is that it? A challenge? 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad. 
PICARD: I don't know who or what Darmok and Jalad are, but I certainly
didn't come here to start a war. 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. 
(Dathon throws a dagger towards Picard's feet. Picard picks it up and
throws it back) 
PICARD: Sorry, Captain. 
DATHON: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
(he picks up the dagger and backs away)

DATA: Sensors show Captain Picard and the Tamarian
in apparent good health, approximately twenty metres from each other. 
RIKER: Hail the Tamarian ship. 
WORF: On screen. 
RIKER: You are holding our captain. I want him released. 
TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Darmok at Tanagra. 
RIKER: Your action could be interpreted as an act of war. 
TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Kiteo. His eyes closed. Chenza at court. The
court of silence. Chenza! 
RIKER: Is there any way to get through to them? 
DATA: Not without further study. 
RIKER: Close the channel, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Gladly, sir. 
RIKER: Worf, I want you to assemble a security team, take a shuttle
down to the planet, bring back the captain. 
WORF: Aye, Commander. 
DATA: Sir, the Tamarians are fully capable of stopping a shuttle. 
RIKER: I'm aware of that. But disrupting our transporter beam and
firing on a shuttle are two entirely different things. I'm betting
they're not going to push it that far.
