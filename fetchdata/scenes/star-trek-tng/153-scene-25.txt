PICARD: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Aster is in her quarters. 
RIKER: Repeat, Worf? 
[Jeremy's quarters]

WORF: Lieutenant Aster is here. In her quarters
with the boy. 
PICARD [OC]: Do not provoke her 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Or interfere in any way until I arrive.
Picard out. Number One, have Security moving that way but tell them to
keep their distance. You have the Bridge. Counsellor. 
[Jeremy's quarters]

MARLA: There is nothing to worry about. I'm going
to take care of Jeremy and make him happy. It's time to go. 
WORF: Where are you taking the child? 
JEREMY: To the planet. 
MARLA: Come, Jeremy. 
(Jeremy has to open the door for her) 
WORF: Worf to Picard, they're leaving their quarters. 
[Turbolift]

WORF [OC]: Captain, I believe we're headed for
transporter room three.
PICARD: We're on our way.

[Transporter room]

MARLA: Chief O'Brien, Jeremy and I are going down
to the surface. 
(She and Jeremy get on the pads as Picard and Troi arrive) 
PICARD: Who are you? 
MARLA: I'm Marla Aster. 
JEREMY: It's my mother, Captain. She's alive. 
PICARD: What do you want? 
MARLA: To take my child down to the planet. 
PICARD: I cannot permit that. The boy is my responsibility. 
MARLA: I'm here to care for him. He needs me. Why do you resist? 
PICARD: Because I don't know who or what you are. 
JEREMY: Can't you see who it is, Captain? 
PICARD: Jeremy, she appears to be your mother, but she is not. 
JEREMY: What do you mean? 
MARLA: You're confusing the boy. 
(Worf grabs Jeremy and takes him off the transporter pad) 
JEREMY: Hey! Wait! Stop! No! No! Wait! Stop! 
(Marla vanishes) 
JEREMY: Mom! Mom? 
TROI: Jeremy 
JEREMY: Wait a minute. Let go of me. She was right there!
