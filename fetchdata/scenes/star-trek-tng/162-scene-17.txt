[Bridge]

DATA: As you know, Captain, we are looking for a
phenomenon that reoccurs every five hours, twenty minutes and three
seconds. 
PICARD: The interval between radiation bursts. 
DATA: We have found one such phenomenon on the planet's surface. 
LAFORGE: It's the field generator that Apgar during in his research.
When it's fully charged, it automatically emits an energy pulse and
then takes five hours, twenty minutes and three seconds to recharge
itself. 
WESLEY: It must have been left on after the explosion of the lab. 
PICARD: But why would a generator be affecting the Enterprise this way?

DATA: It should not be. It is a harmless lambda field generator. 
LAFORGE: But we knew that somehow it was related to our radiation
bursts and then the pieces started just falling together. 
DATA: We now know what is causing the bursts, and why the science
station exploded, sir. 
WESLEY: And we also know who killed Doctor Apgar.

[Holodeck - Space Station Lab]

PICARD: Chief Inspector, we've watched the events
replayed over and over again and I am impressed, and admittedly
dismayed by the body of evidence against Commander Riker. But isn't it
remarkable that with all the witnesses, all the different points of
view of the events aboard the space station, we haven't seen what
really happened? 
KRAG: I do not understand. 
PICARD: Allow me, with the help of Mister La Forge, to explain.
Computer, load Manua programme one, time index fourteen four one. Play
programme. 
APGAR: Fine. Whatever. Starfleet will get its Krieger wave converter.
These things take time. I've had a few setbacks, that's all. 
PICARD: Freeze. Mrs. Apgar, this was from your deposition. It would
seem to suggest that your husband had failed to create Krieger waves. 
GUEST0: Yes, but he was very close to a breakthrough. 
PICARD: He said he needed more time. He was upset by our early arrival.
But in fact I maintain he already had made that breakthrough and that
he was lying to us. 
KRAG: On what basis? 
LAFORGE: For the last several hours, the Enterprise has been
experiencing unusual radiation bursts. We've identified them as Krieger
waves. 
GUEST1: Krieger waves? But that's impossible. From where? 
LAFORGE: From right here. Inside the holodeck. 
PICARD: We recreated your science lab in every conceivable detail.
Essentially, what was in the original lab is here. 
LAFORGE: Including the Krieger wave converter that Doctor Apgar claimed
didn't work. Except it does work. 
PICARD: Your field generator on the planet surface has been sending out
harmless energy charges, which this facsimile has been converting into
Krieger waves. 
RIKER: But the holodeck can't create anything dangerous. 
LAFORGE: Well, it didn't. When you get down to basics, the converter is
nothing more than a complex series of mirrors and reflective coils. The
energy from the field generator down on the planet simply reflects off
of elements in the convertor which turns it into highly focused Krieger
waves. 
PICARD: And those same waves have been randomly striking different
areas of our ship as we orbit the planet and our angle to the generator
changes. 
KRAG: Why would Apgar lie about his success? 
PICARD: Computer, run Manua programme one, time code, fourteen three
eight.
