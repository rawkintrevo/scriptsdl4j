[Bridge]

PICARD: What's the situation, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: There are roughly two hundred people down here. 
PICARD: Their condition? 
RIKER [OC]: Surprisingly good. 
PICARD: Are they willing to leave? 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, but 
PICARD: Well, get them up here. 
RIKER [OC]: I'm having a little debate with the colony's leader. It
seems 
PICARD: There's no time, Number One. Initiate the transport. 
RIKER [OC]: But, sir 
PICARD: Whatever the problem, we'll handle it up here. 
RIKER [OC]: Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: First load ready, Mister O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN: Energising. 
(And onto the pad come - six adult, one child, a sheep, goat, chicken,
barrels, hay.... and cod-Irish background music for the big clue as to
the upcoming accents) 
O'BRIEN: Captain, you'd better get somebody down here. Right away. 
(The second transport group includes a porker, ducks in a crate and so
on) 
DANILO: Take the pig out there, will you? Very good. 
RIKER: O'Brien, I think that third wave should be in position. 
DANILO: Shoo, damn you, shoo. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
DANILO: O'Brien, is it? (shakes hands) I should have known t'would be a
good Irishman that was running this ship. 
(Picard and Worf enter as Danilo offers a hip flask) 
PICARD: What the devil is going on here, Number One? 
DANILO: Ah, Captain Picard is it. The man who makes decisions for me
and mine without so much as a by your leave. 
PICARD: This is my Security Chief, Lieutenant Worf. 
DANILO: (swallows and removed hat) I don't suppose security is much of
a problem for you. Danilo Odell, sir, at your service. 
PICARD: What are these animals doing here, Number One. 
RIKER: I'm sorry, sir. It was either this or arguing till hell froze
over. 
DANILO: Captain Picard, sir, we can't leave our animals here to die.
Besides, how could we build our future without our animals? 
PICARD: All right. Chief O'Brien, transport this group directly to
cargo hold seven, and beam the remaining refugees from the planet
directly to that hold. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. 
DANILO: Right, lads. Everybody back onto the infernal machine. 
RIKER: Everybody up here.
