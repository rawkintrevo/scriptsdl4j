[The Dauphin - Ten Forward]

WESLEY: What should I say? How do I act? What do I
do? 
RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? 
GUINAN: Sounds simple enough. 
RIKER: Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most important.
You may want to start with something like this here. You are the most
beautiful woman in the galaxy. But that might not work. 
GUINAN: Yes. Yes, it would. 
RIKER: You don't know how long I've wanted to tell you that. 
GUINAN: But you were afraid. 
RIKER: Yes. 
GUINAN: Of me? 
RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. 
WESLEY: Commander? 
RIKER: Or that you might think that was a line. 
GUINAN: Maybe I do think it's a line. 
RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? 
GUINAN: I didn't say that. There's nothing wrong with a line. It's like
a knock on the door. 
RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? 
GUINAN: I'm not sending you away. 
RIKER: That's more than I expected. 
GUINAN: Is it as much as you hoped? 
RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. 
GUINAN: Dreams can be dangerous. 
RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars
and the universe worships the night. 
GUINAN: Careful. Putting me on a pedestal so high, you may not be able
to reach me. 
RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and the
soul in my night. 
WESLEY: I don't think this is my style. 
GUINAN: Shut up, kid. Tell me more about my eyes.

[The Icarus Factor - Troi's office]

RIKER: I didn't want to leave without saying
goodbye. 
TROI: I don't like goodbyes. How about, until next time. 
RIKER: How about, until next time. 
TROI: It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. 
RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. 
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but I can't read you
right now. 
RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. 
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. 
RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. 
TROI: Are you feeling sad? 
RIKER: Yes, I am. 
TROI: So am I. 
[Sickbay]

TROI: He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of warmth
and friendship. 
PULASKI: He's reliving memories. It's a natural side effect of neural
stimulation. Look at this. The organisms' metabolism has changed. I
wonder if the stimulation is affecting them somehow. I'm going to
refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex. 
TROI: To intensify his memories? 
PULASKI: Exactly. We'll see if that has an effect on the microbes. 
[Justice - Edo Council Chambers]

RIVAN: Everyone! We've brought the visitors. 
LIATOR: Please, enjoy what we have. 

[11001001 - Bourbon Street Bar]

RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call
enhancement, you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockout
like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this? 
MINUET: Waiting for you. 
RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious? 
MINUET: Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Something wrong? 
TROI: No, it's just that Commander Riker's emotions are rather
passionate. 
PULASKI: As in erotic? 
TROI: Very much so.
