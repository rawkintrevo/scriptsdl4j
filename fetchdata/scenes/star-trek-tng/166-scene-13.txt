[Corridor]

PICARD 2: Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about the
crew. How are they reacting to our sudden change in course? 
TROI: I sense no unusual reaction, Captain. After all, such a change is
hardly out of the ordinary. 
PICARD 2: They're not curious or concerned as to why? 
TROI: They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. 
PICARD 2: How far do you think that trust goes? 
TROI: Sir? 
PICARD 2: I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had full
confidence in me. But what if it were to change? 
TROI: Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Counsellor.

[Holding cell]

ESOQQ: My given name is Esoqq. It means fighter. 
THOLL: I'll bet half the names in the Chalnoth language mean fighter. 
ESOQQ: Mizarians. Your names all mean surrender. 
THOLL: We are a peaceful race, a race of thinkers. 
ESOQQ: A race of cowards. And you? I don't know your people. 
HARO: I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine. 
ESOQQ: Who would want to imprison a child? 
HARO: I'm not a child. 
PICARD: Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy.
Someone with a reason for confining us here. 
ESOQQ: There are Chalnoth who would kill me if they could. But kidnap?
There is no reason. 
PICARD: You have many enemies? 
ESOQQ: None of consequence. I've slain all the ones who mattered. That
shocks you, Bolian? 
HARO: A little. 
ESOQQ: And you? 
THOLL: I'm not surprised. I've heard about your race. You're
uncivilised. You have no laws, no system of government 
ESOQQ: The Chalnoth have no use for laws or governments! We are strong.
We obey no one. 
THOLL: You live in anarchy, murdering one another, That mentality may
get us all killed. 
ESOQQ: And you may be the first. 
PICARD: Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. 
THOLL: Neither is asking us useless questions, Picard. But, if you must
pursue the topic, How long have you and the Romulans been adversaries? 
PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing to
entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans.
But what would the Romulans want with you? 
THOLL: My brainpower, perhaps. It's well known that my species
possesses superior intelligence and I am considered among the brightest
of my people. 
HARO: And the least modest. 
ESOQQ: What is this? 
PICARD: Food. 
ESOQQ: The only food? 
PICARD: It would seem so. 
ESOQQ: Poison! 
THOLL: Does this mean there's nothing here for you to eat? 
ESOQQ: You. 
THOLL: Don't even think that! Picard, you won't let him 
PICARD: Esoqq, how long can you go without food? 
ESOQQ: Three days. Perhaps four. 
PICARD: No longer? 
ESOQQ: No longer.

[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: Well, all your tests indicate the same
results. You are in great shape. 
PICARD 2: I never felt better. 
CRUSHER: I see. Then why did you come in? Your annual physical isn't
due for another month. 
PICARD 2: Well, usually you have to remind me, then badger me, and
finally order me to report. For once I thought I'd save you the
trouble. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, be honest with your doctor. Are there any warning
signs or symptoms that you haven't told me about? 
PICARD 2: As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy. 
CRUSHER: Well, then, return to your post. 
PICARD 2: Will you have dinner with me tonight? 
CRUSHER: In Ten Forward? 
PICARD 2: What about my quarters? More intimate. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, you are full of surprises today. 
PICARD 2: I take that to be a yes.

[Holding cell]

THOLL: Picard is it wise to attempt an escape? 
PICARD: It's imperative. 
THOLL: Why? Our captors haven't mistreated us. 
HARO: We've been kidnapped, locked in a room. You don't think that's
mistreatment? 
THOLL: They haven't hurt us, have they? I think we should just wait
until we find out what they want. Be patient. 
PICARD: We can no longer afford to be patient. Unless we act soon,
Esoqq will starve. 
THOLL: If we antagonise them, they may decide we're more trouble than
we're worth, kill us and go capture another four. 
PICARD: I agree that's a risk, but I see no alternative. 
THOLL: Well, I refuse to help. 
PICARD: As you wish, Mister Tholl. We must get inside this panel. 
ESOQQ: Not very sturdy. 
PICARD: Stand back, Haro. 
(Esoqq puts his fist through the panel and rips the surround out of the
wall) 
HARO: The design is simple. Cross-circuiting the door mechanism should
be easy. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
HARO: Yes, sir. 
(She flips a few connections then reaches up inside the wall) 
HARO: I think I've got it. 
(The door opens an inch, closes again, then a green light hits the
three. They fall to the floor in pain) 
THOLL: I warned you. 
[Picard's quarters]

(Jean-Luc and Beverly have made it to the after
dinner drinks) 
CRUSHER: Out with it, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD 2: Out with what? 
CRUSHER: Whatever has been on your mind all evening long. 
PICARD 2: Has it been that apparent? How well you know me. 
CRUSHER: After all this time, I ought to. 
PICARD 2: Well, it's true, I have been preoccupied. I know that's not
very flattering to you, but I have been thinking about us. And about
the choices I've made. 
CRUSHER: We've both made choices. 
PICARD 2: And I've been wondering if they were the right ones.
Sometimes I feel we've allowed our positions to isolate us. 
CRUSHER: Our positions necessitate a degree of professional detachment.

PICARD 2: But there's a danger in becoming too detached, of never
permitting ourselves to get closer. 
CRUSHER: Is that what you want, Jean-Luc? To get closer? 
PICARD 2: You're a very attractive woman. 
CRUSHER: And you're a very attractive man. But we both know it's not as
simple as that. 
PICARD 2: Would it be simpler if I were not your commanding officer? 
CRUSHER: Simpler, perhaps, but that's not the only issue. I guess,
right now, I'm comfortable with our relationship just the way it is. 
PICARD 2: Would you care to dance? 
CRUSHER: I thought you didn't dance. 
PICARD 2: On special occasions. 
(He holds her close in a slow shuffle) 
PICARD 2: I don't think I told you, but I'm glad you're back on the
Enterprise. I missed our friendship. 
CRUSHER: I did too. 
(The dance become more of a vertical embrace, and then they kiss) 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you better, I would think you were
playing games with me. 
PICARD 2: You're sorry you came tonight? 
CRUSHER: I didn't say that. 
PICARD 2: Good. Because I'm delighted you did. But, perhaps we should
call it a night. 
(He opens the door for her) 
PICARD 2: Goodnight.
