CRUSHER: Two bleeders, single plane penetration. I
need the autosuture here. 
NURSE: Yes, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Looks like the blade hit the sternum and was deflected. It
could have been a lot worse. 
PICARD: Then it wasn't a dream. 
CRUSHER: I'm afraid not. No vital organs pierced, no major arteries. 
PICARD: Where is the boy now? 
CRUSHER: Worf has him in security. Hold still. 
PICARD: I want to see him. Here. Now. 
CRUSHER: He'll wait until I'm finished.

WORF: Talarian warships converging. Range, five
hundred kilometres. 
RIKER: On screen. Any communication, Lieutenant Worf?

WESLEY: Commander, the warships' closing velocities are slowing.
Staggered approach vectors bearing zero, one hundred twenty, and two
hundred forty degrees.

LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, sir. 
RIKER: The Talarians are moving

LAFORGE: I've tapped the impulse engines for additional power to
shields.
