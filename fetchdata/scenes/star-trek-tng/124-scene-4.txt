[Cafe des Artistes]

(Picard is greeted by the head waiter) 
EDOUARD: Monsieur, welcome to the Cafe des Artistes. Is this your first
time in Paris? 
PICARD: No. 
EDOUARD: This way. 
PICARD: That table. 
EDOUARD: Mais oui, bien sur, monsieur. We are here to please you. 
(Picard gazes from the balcony towards le Tour d'Eiffel, and the
otherwise future city-scape) 
PICARD: I've been away far too long. 
EDOUARD: Some wine, some cheese? 
PICARD: I'm not very hungry. I really came for the view. 
EDOUARD: Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu. 
PICARD: Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous. I was
to meet someone. Someone here, at this very table. 
EDOUARD: Your young lady, she did not come? 
PICARD: Actually, I don't know. I always imagined that she did. 
EDOUARD: You, however, did not. Ah. Well, trust Edouard. I will bring
something very special, just for you. 
(Two young women are talking at the next table) 
FRANCINE: Let's go. We've waited long enough. 
GABRIELLE: Fine. You go. I'll stay a little longer.
FRANCINE: He's not coming, Gabrielle. 
GABRIELLE: No, after last night, I know he will. I just know. 
FRANCINE: Then he would be here. You are making a fool out of yourself,
and I will not watch. 
(Francine walks away) 
GABRIELLE: Do we know each other? 
PICARD: No. 
GABRIELLE: The way you look at me, do I remind you of someone? 
PICARD: No. Yes, you do, somewhat. 
GABRIELLE: He's not coming. Why? What did I do to drive him away? 
PICARD: Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he was
afraid. 
GABRIELLE: Of what? Of me? 
PICARD: Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as you
are, he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do. Maybe. Enough of
this self-indulgence. Exit.
