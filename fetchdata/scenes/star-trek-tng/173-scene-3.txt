RIKER CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE TEMPLE

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: What's this all about, Commander? 
RIKER: Sensors have discovered a small one-man spaceship crashed on the
planet. 
CRUSHER: We're picked up life-signs, humanoid, very faint and fading.

[Planet surface]

(A harsh, rocky place littered with bits of metal) 
DATA: Radiation levels within acceptable limits. 
(There is a man tumbled out the back of a shuttlecraft sized ship. The
man has a badly burned face) 
LAFORGE: We can beam him out from under there, get him right up to
Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: He's not stable enough for transport. There's damage to his
brain stem, autonomic functions are failing. His heart needs active
neurofeedback. It can't regulate itself. I need a volunteer. 
LAFORGE: Right here. 
CRUSHER: I'm going to hook your nervous systems to the tricorder. Your
brain will regulate both systems. That
should stabilise him long enough to get him up to the ship. 
CRUSHER: Take deep, regular breaths. If anything goes wrong I'll break
the connection. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
(Something golden leaps from the injured man into Geordi's head via the
neural thingummyjig) 
CRUSHER: Geordi! 
LAFORGE: I'm fine. No problem. 
CRUSHER: Transporter room, three to beam directly to Sickbay.

[Sickbay - room four]

CRUSHER: Autonomic responses are still low. Begin
cardiostimulation. Sixty cc's of inaprovaline. Massive infection is
setting in. Use the protodynoplaser to stabilize his immune system. We
need to design a virus that can infiltrate his cell structure and boost
his ATP production. 
TEMPLE: (a female nurse) What about Commander La Forge. He's waiting in
the diagnostic centre. 
CRUSHER: I need you to give him a full bioscan. See if there's any
residual effect from that energy discharge during the neurolink. Keep
his arm in cryogenic stasis until the vital signs are strong enough to
begin surgical procedures.
