T'SU: East of your position, ten metres. I will
continue monitoring. 

[Jungle]

RIKER: I can't see anything through here. The
underbrush is too thick. 
RICE: Hello. Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Rice! Where did you come from? 
RICE: I was over there. 
RIKER: We were worried about you. I should have known you'd pop up. 
RICE: How are you, Commander Riker? 
RIKER: Me? Forget about me. How are you? No word, no message, nothing. 
RICE: How many are with you? 
RIKER: There are two others. Where's the Drake? Where's your crew? 
PICARD [OC]: Number One, a word. We have some information you should be
aware of.

PICARD: Ensign T'Su?
T'SU: Sensors indicate low level energy readings, but the only life
signs are the away team. 
PICARD: You copy, Number One? 
[Jungle]

RIKER: Understood. You look strange, Paul. 
RICE: I was injured getting here. 
(Tasha and Data arrive) 
RIKER: Do you need medical help? 
RICE: No. What's your purpose here? 
RIKER: Commander Data, Lieutenant Yar. 
DATA: Sir, other than ourselves, I am picking up no life signs here. 
RIKER: I know. 
RICE: Riker, you didn't answer me. Who sent you here to look for me? 
RIKER: Your mother. She's worried about you. 
RICE: Tell me about your ship, Riker. It's the Enterprise, isn't it? 
RIKER: No. The name of my ship is the Lollipop. 
RICE: I have no knowledge of that ship. 
RIKER: It's just been commissioned. It's a good ship. 
RICE: Refresh me, would you, Riker? What's its size, it's complement? 
RIKER: Who is here with you? 
RICE: What's the armament on the Lollipop? 
RIKER: Paul, I will only answer your questions if you answer mine. Why
do you want to know so much about my ship? 
RICE: We're friends, aren't we? 
RIKER: Old friends. 
RICE: Our top speed is warp three. What's yours? 
RIKER: Is? Then the Drake has not been destroyed. 
RICE: The Drake? 
RIKER: Yes, your ship. 
RICE: Of course, my ship is the Drake. 
RIKER: Where is it? 
RICE: Classified. 
RIKER: Classified? 
RICE: Please, it's important. Our survival depends on knowing. What's
the armament on your ship? 
RIKER: Ten. 
RICE: Ten? I don't understand. Ten what? 
RIKER: Six. 
RICE: Commander Riker, your answers make no sense. 
RIKER: You haven't used my first name once, Paul. You remember it,
don't you? You don't, do you? Because you don't exist. You're a fake.
You're an image of the original, aren't you? Answer me! 
(Paul Rice disappears and a flying machine appears) 
PICARD [OC]: Report, Number One. 
RIKER: The image of Rice has been replaced by something which is
hovering several metres away.

PICARD: Number One, get your team back up here.

[Jungle]

RIKER: Prepare to beam up. 
(The device envelopes Riker with a green field) 
TASHA: Commander! 
(Tasha destroys it with her phaser but the field remains)

PICARD: What's happened, Number One? Report.
Report! Report!
