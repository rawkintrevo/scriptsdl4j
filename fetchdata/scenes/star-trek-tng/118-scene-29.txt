[Wesley's room]

(That night, Wesley sneaks out of bed) 
WESLEY: Custodian's room.

[Custodian room]

WESLEY: Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher. 
CUSTODIAN: Proceed, Wesley. 
WESLEY: Show me where the Enterprise children are in relation to this
room. Thank you. Goodnight. 
CUSTODIAN: Good night, Wesley. 
[Katie's room]

(Katie is startled awake by a hand on her arm) 
WESLEY: I think I know a way to get us home. I need your help.

Chief Medical Officer's log, stardate 41512.9. I've
begun to suspect that whatever is killing the Aldeans is related to a
danger faced by Earth in the twenty first century. Can it be that
Aldea's ozone layer has been weakened? 
[Wesley's room]

KATIE: Why will not talking or eating make them
send us home? 
WESLEY: It's called passive resistance. We don't do what they want us
to do and then they won't want us. 
KATIE: Will they get mad at us? 
WESLEY: They won't hurt us. 
HARRY: But, Wes, I do kind of like them. 
WESLEY: So do I, but I don't want to stay here forever. Do you? 
HARRY: No, but I like working with the wood. 
WESLEY: Harry, we all have to be in this together or it's not going to
work. 
HARRY: Okay. I'll do it. 
RASHELLA: What are you all doing here together? 
(She reaches for Alexandria, but Wesley picks her up instead) 
RASHELLA: What is going on here? 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: I've got it, Captain. The Aldeans are
suffering from a form of radiation poisoning. 
PICARD: Is that what made the Aldeans sterile? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
PICARD: Is it reversible? 
CRUSHER: With the proper treatment, yes. 
DATA: Captain. 
CRUSHER: Sir. 
DATA: These permutations are going to take a very long time. 
PICARD: How long? 
DATA: Weeks. 
RIKER: There is the option. 
LAFORGE: We were able to further define the weakness in their shield.
Now, it's not a hole as much as it is a fluctuation. 
RIKER: If the timing is precise, it's possible to beam through and onto
the planet. 
PICARD: Why don't we just beam the children up through the hole? 
RIKER: The timing would be more difficult, and the risk greater. 
PICARD: All right. You and Data beam down. Locate the power source of
that shield. Knock it out. I'll delay the Aldeans until you're ready.
