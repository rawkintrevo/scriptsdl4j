[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Power transfer fields may be pinched off. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: I'm working on it. 
WORF: Captain! 
PICARD: Not yet, Mister Worf. This is just a tap on the shoulder, or we
wouldn't be here talking about it. 
WORF: The Romulans are hailing us. 
PICARD: On screen. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard, I hardly expected to see you
again so soon. It seems this time you are the one who has made an
aggressive move across the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Commander Tomalak, as I'm sure you already know, we were
responding to a warnings of Romulan incursions at Nelvana Three. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: But, Captain, as you can see, there is no
incursion. 
PICARD: And the matter of the unidentified subspace radio emissions,
and the ionisation
disturbances? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Ah, you must mean our orbiting probe. We are
studying Nelvana Three for archaeological research. 
PICARD: With a cloaked satellite? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Really, Captain, would you have us believe
this satellite is an excuse for your aggressive charge across the
Neutral Zone? 
PICARD: You can believe what you wish. We will be on our way. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Without even an apology, Captain? 
PICARD: If an apology will do, then I offer it. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid it won't, so I will save you the
humiliation. 
PICARD: Get to it, Tomalak. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You see, Picard, after we dissect your
Enterprise for every precious bit of information, I intend to display
its broken hull in the centre of the Romulan capitol as a symbol of our
victory. It will inspire our armies for generations
to come, and serve as a warning to any other traitor who would create
ripples of disloyalty. 
GUEST2: All the communiqus, all the timetables, all the records. They
were all fiction, written for my benefit. A test. A test of my loyalty.
And you used me to lure the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: First, Captain, you will return the traitor
Jarok, then you will surrender as prisoners of war. 
PICARD: Do you seriously expect me to accept those terms? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: No, Captain Picard, I expect you won't. You
have thirty seconds to decide. 
PICARD: I do not require one, Tomalak. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I urge you, Captain Picard, surrender.
Consider the men and women you would lead into a lost cause. 
PICARD: If the cause is just and honourable, they are prepared to give
their lives. Are you prepared to die today, Tomalak? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I expected more from you than an idle threat,
Picard. 
PICARD: Then you shall have it. Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Three mean Klingon vessels uncloak around the Enterprise and Romulans)

WORF: Klingon warships armed and ready, sir. 
PICARD: What shall it be, Tomalak? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: You will still not survive our assault. 
PICARD: You will not survive ours. Shall we die together? 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I look forward to our next meeting, Captain. 
WORF: Romulan disruptors powering down, sir. 
(The warbirds cloak and leave) 
PICARD: Cancel red alert. Mister Worf, will you extend the appreciation
of the Federation and my personal gratitude to the Klingons. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Take us back, Number One. 
GUEST2: I did it for nothing. My home, my family. For nothing.
