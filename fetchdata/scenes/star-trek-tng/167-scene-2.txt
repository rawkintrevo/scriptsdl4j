PIKER PICARD RIKER CRUSHER TROI

[Bridge]

RIKER: Welcome back, Deanna. 
TROI: It's good to be back. The last two weeks have been gruelling. 
RIKER: I take it the Captain was able to negotiate an agreement
mutually beneficial to both parties. 
TROI: He was. I don't know how he managed it. The Gemarians and the
Dachlyds are both incredibly stubborn people. 
RIKER: The more difficult the task, the sweeter the victory. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Go to warp four, Mister Bennett. Set a course for Starbase
twelve. Report. 
RIKER: Everything status quo, sir. 
PICARD: Very well. If anyone needs me, I'll be in my Ready Room. 
RIKER: Sir. Congratulations. 
PICARD: About what? 
PIKER: About the trade agreement. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: Is it my imagination, or is something bothering the Captain? 
TROI: He has been under a great deal of strain lately. While we were on
Gemaris, he ate sparingly and slept even less. 
RIKER: Anything we can do? 
TROI: Actually, I have a solution in mind, but I doubt he'll agree to
it. 
RIKER: What would that be? 
TROI: Our captain needs a vacation.

[Ready room]

(Picard is so engrossed in what he is doing, that
the doorbell has to ring twice to get his attention) 
PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: Sir, it's been brought to my attention one of the crew has
been neglecting his health again. 
PICARD: How so? 
CRUSHER: It's a classic case of stress-related ailments brought on by
overwork. Exhaustion, irritability, muscle spasms. Yet he insists on
ignoring them. 
PICARD: Doesn't sound too serious. 
CRUSHER: And I plan to keep it that way. 
PICARD: What's the treatment. 
CRUSHER: A week's shore leave. 
PICARD: Impossible. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I could make that an order. 
PICARD: But you won't. Beverly, you know I loathe vacations. 
CRUSHER: You loathe going on vacations. Once you're there you have a
marvellous time. You told me your four days on Zytchin Three were
wonderful. 
PICARD: I lied. Look, the Enterprise is scheduled to spend a week
undergoing maintenance overhaul at Starbase twelve. While there, I
promise that I will make full use of available recreation activity. 
CRUSHER: Watching some technician fill deuterium tanks is not my idea
of fun. 
PICARD: I suppose I could find a few hours to spend on the holodeck. 
CRUSHER: Forget the holodeck. Isn't there someplace you want to go? 
PICARD: The Astrophysics Centre on Icor Nine is holding a symposium on
rogue star clusters. I had given serious thought to attending. 
CRUSHER: The last thing you need is serious thought. Jean-Luc, why
don't you go some place beautiful, where you can relax and be pampered.
You deserve it. 
PICARD: I'll give it serious thought. 
CRUSHER: Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor. Enough.
