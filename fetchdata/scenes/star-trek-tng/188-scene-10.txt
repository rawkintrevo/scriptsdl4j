TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER MCKNIGHT CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

MCKNIGHT: (the blonde lady at helm) Entering the
T-tauri system, now, Captain. 
DATA: Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path.
Source unknown. 
WORF: Still picking up energy distortions, but fading. It seems to be
gone. 
PICARD: A wormhole? 
DATA: Very likely. Small and extremely unstable wormholes have been
mapped near thirty nine T-tauri systems in the last one hundred years
alone, sir. 
RIKER: Captain, I suggest we move to a safer location. It could
reappear at any moment. 
PICARD: Agreed, Number One. Ensign, take us a course 
DATA: Captain! 
(Big swirly thing on viewscreen. When Data turns around everyone else
is out cold. They wake up after the opening titles) 
DATA: Captain? 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: Careful, Captain. The stun effect from the wormhole was
relatively severe. 
PICARD: Apparently so. How long were we unconscious? 
DATA: Approximately thirty seconds. I have scanned the entire ship and
detected no life-threatening injuries among the crew. 
PICARD: You were not affected? 
DATA: No, sir. My positronic system is immune to the effect. This is
the third unstable wormhole I have passed through during my time with
Starfleet. The first was aboard the USS Trieste 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. Well, where the hell are we? 
RIKER: Point five four parsecs from our original position. Almost a
day's travel in just thirty seconds? 
DATA: Sir, I should re-align the ship's clock with Starbase four ten's
subspace signal to adjust for the time distortion. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
DATA: Yes, Captain. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, this is Crusher in Sickbay. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER [OC]: I'm getting scattered reports

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Of minor injuries. What's happened? 
PICARD [OC]: The Enterprise just jumped through a wormhole. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Apparently we were all unconscious for
about thirty seconds. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Is everybody all right there? 
PICARD: There's little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Acknowledged. Crusher out.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ship's status? 
RIKER: Reports coming in now. Nothing serious so far. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, Captain. I've checked impulse engines and
warp drives, sir. They appear to be unaffected. 
WORF: Shields and weapons systems are fully functional. 
PICARD: Counsellor? Are you all right? 
TROI: I think so. I'm feeling a bit unfocused. It'll pass. 
PICARD: Well, not too bad, all things considered. 
RIKER: We're lucky we didn't end up half way across the galaxy in the
middle of next week. 
DATA: That was never actually a possibility. The wormhole's small size
and relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon. 
PICARD: There's still the anomalous M-class planet we were going to
investigate. Do we go back? 
DATA: The unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigation
a hazardous one. A probe launched from our current position would be
more advisable. 
PICARD: Make it so.
