RIKER LAFORGE PICARD Q GUINAN SONYA

[Ten Forward]

(Guinan gets a strange feeling and leaves her bar
to look around) 
GUINAN: Bridge, this is Ten Forward.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Guinan? I don't remember you ever calling
the Bridge before.
GUINAN [OC]: Is everything alright?
RIKER: How do you mean?
GUINAN [OC]: Is there anything unusual happening?
RIKER: No Guinan, nothing out of the ordinary. Why do you ask?

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: I'm not sure. It's just a feeling. I've had
it a couple of times before. It's probably nothing. Forget that I
called. Ten Forward out.

[Shuttlecraft]

Q: The locator beacon won't help. They'll never
think to look for you this far away.
PICARD: Enterprise, this is Picard. Stop this foolishness, Q. Return me
to the Enterprise.
Q: I suggest you change your attitude. Petulance does not become you.
We have business, Picard.
PICARD: Keeping me a prisoner here will not compel me to discuss
anything with you.
Q: It will in time.

[Ten forward]

SONYA: I appreciate your advice, Lieutenant. And,
I'll take it to heart.
LAFORGE: Guinan?
GUINAN: Can I get you something?
LAFORGE: We're fine. Is everything all right?
GUINAN: I don't know.
LAFORGE: I think I'll go check out Engineering.
SONYA: I'll go with you.
