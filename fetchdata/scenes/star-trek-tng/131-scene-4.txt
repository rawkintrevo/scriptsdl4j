[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: All is quiet so far. Of course, no one
knew we were coming. 
PICARD: Use caution, but protect Graves' health 
[Living room]

PICARD [OC]: At all costs. 
DATA: Understood, sir. I suggest we look around to see if anybody is
home. 
WORF: No need, Commander. 
GUEST1: You heard me. Thank God. I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'
assistant. 
TROI: We're from a ship called the Enterprise. We monitored your
distress call but then you never acknowledged our response. 
GUEST1: I'm sorry, I couldn't take the chance. 
TROI: Chance? What chance? 
(A door opens and a crotchety old man enters) 
GUEST0: The chance that I might find out someone was coming. Kareen
knew full well that I would not be pleased, to put it mildly. 
GUEST1: I had no choice. I refuse to stand by and watch you
deteriorate. 
GUEST2: (a Vulcan lady played by Susie Plaxton) What symptoms have you
noticed? 
GUEST1: He has pain, shortness of breath, irritability. 
GUEST0: Ridiculous! I'm as healthy as a Rigelian ox! 
GUEST1: He's not himself, believe me. His temper is completely out of
control. 
GUEST0: Nonsense! 
GUEST1: Ira! 
GUEST2: I am a doctor. Lieutenant Selar. 
GUEST0: No offense, but I don't want you touching me in any way. It's
no secret that I don't like people much, and I like doctors even less. 
TROI: That's funny, I thought most doctors were people. 
GUEST0: Then you're wrong. Ask any patient. Although I will admit, for
a doctor you're not a bad looking woman. Well, well, well, what have we
got here? Another lovely specimen of womanhood. 
TROI: I thought you didn't like people. 
GUEST0: Women aren't people. They're women. (he kisses her hand) 
TROI: I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honour to meet you, Doctor Graves. 
GUEST0: Yes, of course it is. This is one of the truly great moments of
your life. 
GUEST1: Excuse me, sir. Are you a Romulan? 
WORF: Hardly. 
GUEST0: He's a Klingon, Kareen. Kareen has lived here since her father
died when she was very young. Her only knowledge of unhuman races comes
from me. Klingons and Romulans don't look much alike, Kareen, even
though they act much alike. 
WORF: Must I stand here and be insulted? 
GUEST0: No insult intended, Mister Klingon. You see, Doctor, there's
nothing wrong with my hearing. My, my, my, my. 
DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data 
GUEST0: Shhh! Absolutely no aesthetic value whatsoever. Looks like
Soong's work. 
(Selar is examining Graves behind his back) 
DATA: Quite correct, sir! Did you know Doctor Soong? 
GUEST0: Know him?! I taught him everything he knows. You could say that
I was the father of his work. Which kind of makes me your grandfather,
doesn't it sonny? Damn doctors! Always sneaking up on one. Attacking
from the rear. Go on, gorgeous. Spit it out. Whatever the hell it is, I
can take it. 
GUEST2: I've checked twice to make certain. You have Darnay's disease.
I'm sorry, Doctor Graves. It's in it's final stage. 
GUEST1: Can't you do something for him? 
GUEST2: In all cases, Darnay's is terminal. 
Captain's log, Stardate 42437.7. We've successfully
repaired the stricken liner, Constantinople. Forty six of her people
suffered injuries, mostly minor. They have been treated and supplied
with the proper medicines. Our task complete, we are heading back to
Gravesworld with great dispatch.
