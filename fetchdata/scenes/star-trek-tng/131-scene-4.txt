DATA [OC]: Come in. 
(Troi and Geordi enter) 
LAFORGE: Data? 
DATA [OC]: Geordi? Is Counsellor Troi with you? 
TROI: Yes, I'm here, Data. Geordi said you wanted to see us. 
DATA [OC]: Indeed. Or, stated more correctly, I wanted you to see me. 
LAFORGE: Can we come in? 
DATA [OC]: Please. 
(They go through to the inner room, and we see Data's reflection in a
full length mirror. He is sporting a full set, a beard like Riker's) 
LAFORGE: Did you damage your face, Data? 
DATA: It is a beard, Geordi. A fine, full, dignified beard. One which
commands respect and projects thoughtfulness and dignity. Well?
Opinions? 
TROI: It's er, very different. 
DATA: When I stroke the beard thusly, do I not appear more
intellectual? 
TROI: I'm sorry, I have to go now. Goodbye. 
(Troi leaves, quickly, laughing) 
DATA: Why was she laughing?

WORF: We are receiving a transmission from
Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused. Not directed specifically at us. 
PICARD: On viewer, Mister Worf. 
KAREEN [on viewscreen]: (a young blonde woman) If anyone can hear me,
please send a doctor. Things are getting worse. 
(Transmission ends) 
PICARD: Try and raise her, Mister Crusher. Tell them we're only minutes
away. 
WESLEY: It's no good, sir. I don't believe they're receiving us. 
WORF: Our records show that she and Graves are the only ones living on
the planet, Captain. 
RIKER: Then what scared her? 
WORF: Captain, I am picking up another signal, but it is not from the
planet. 
PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. 
WORF: The signal is very weak, sir. Audio only. 
PICARD: Pipe it through. 
MAN [OC]: Mayday! Mayday! This is the USS (static) questing emergency
assistance.
(static) The outer hull is breached and environmental systems
compromised. Need assistance. 
WESLEY: Captain, I show the Constantinople in that general vicinity.
She's a transport ship, used to ferry settlers. I'm showing two
thousand and twelve colonists aboard. 
RIKER: Outer hull breach. She must have had an internal explosion. 
PULASKI: If that's the case, they'll all be prone to severe hypoxia.
Their lives are at risk. We've got to help them. 
PICARD: And what about Graves? 
PULASKI: He's one man. 
RIKER: Suggestion, Captain. Why don't we execute a long range transport
of an away team to assist Doctor Graves at earliest possible moment.
We'd come out of warp just long enough to energise the beam. 
PICARD: A touch and go down warping? Mister Crusher, prepare to make it
so. 
WESLEY: Aye sir. 
PICARD: Engineering, Mister La Forge. We're going to execute a near
warp 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Transport. This may be a little
tricky. I would like you to handle it.
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain.
