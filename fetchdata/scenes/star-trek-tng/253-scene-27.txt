[Lore's lab]

(Geordi is strapped down on a metal frame that's
raising) 
LAFORGE: Data? Who's there? 
DATA: (as Picard) Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Captain. 
DATA: Shh. We're getting out of here. 
LAFORGE: Come on, hurry. Data was just here. I think he went to get
something. 
DATA: (as himself) Too late. My brother suggested that I try to develop
my sense of humour. What do you think? 
LAFORGE: I think it needs a little work. 
(Data aims an instrument at Geordi's visor inputs) 
LAFORGE: What's happening? 
DATA: I'm attemptin to neutralise your pain receptors. 
LAFORGE: What are you going to do to me? 
(Data is injecting something into Geordi's forehead) 
DATA: I am implanting nano-cortical fibres in your cerebrum. They are
designed to learn and mimic your neural firing patterns. Once they are
in place, I will destroy the existing brain cells. We'll see if the
artificial neural network is able to take over your cognitive
functions. 
LAFORGE: Data, listen. Lore is controlling you. He's transmitting a
carrier wave which is affecting your positronic matrix. 
DATA: If the procedure is successful, your cognitive processing
functions will be considerably improved. 
LAFORGE: Don't you care that he's manipulating you? 
DATA: However, there is a sixty percent chance you will not survive the
procedure. 
LAFORGE: I don't care much for those odds. 
(more injections) 
DATA: They are cause for concern. However, I still have Counsellor Troi
and Captain Picard. The odds are that at least one of the procedures
will be successful.

[Holding cell]

TROI: Help me! 
(a Borg comes to see Picard lying on the floor) 
TROI: He tried to escape. The force field sent him into neural shock.
If he dies, Lore will blame you. 
(the innocent Borg takes down the force field and enters. He leans over
Picard and gets one of his tubes pulled out, rendering him unconscious)

PICARD: See if the corridor is empty. 
(but Data is bringing Geordi back) 
DATA: Drop it or I will break his neck. 
(Troi drops the Borg hand weapon and helps guide Geordi into the cell) 
DATA: Take him. 
(Borg remove their fallen comrade) 
PICARD: What have you done to him? 
DATA: I will be back for him later. 
(Data leaves) 
TROI: Geordi, are you in pain? 
LAFORGE: No. I'm just a little dizzy. 
PICARD: I was able to take part of a transceiver from the guard's
interlink system. I think that it uses some kind of phased-pulse
technology. Do you think it could be modified to generate a kedion
pulse that would reboot Data's
programme? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, yeah, it's possible. See if you can locate the phase
modulation circuitry. 
TROI: I'll watch the door. 
PICARD: All right, I think I've found it. 
LAFORGE: Okay, good. Now, do you see anything that we might be able to
use as a flux inhibitor? 
[Bridge]

(at an aft station)
TAITT: Sensors still can't locate the Borg ship. I'm trying to filter
out the interference. 
BARNABY: We'll be within transporter range in nineteen seconds. 
TAITT: I'm starting to get sensor resolution. There's the ship. 
CRUSHER: We'll enter orbit here. 
BARNABY: Helm, new course, heading zero five two mark seven. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
BARNABY: Stand by to drop out of warp in eight seconds. 
TAITT: Once we're in orbit, we should have about forty five seconds
before they intercept us. 
CRUSHER: Let's hope it's enough time. 
BARNABY: Emergency deceleration in five seconds. 
CRUSHER: Hold on. 
(whoomph) 
CRUSHER: Report. 
TAITT: We're in standard orbit, sir. The Borg ship is on the planet's
far side, and is moving to intercept. 
CRUSHER: Bridge to Transporter rooms. Begin evacuations. 
BARNABY: The Borg will be in weapons range in thirty two seconds. We
still can't locate Captain Picard's team and there's no sign of
Commander Riker or Lieutenant Worf. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Salazar. Report. 
SALAZAR [OC]: We're pulling the last teams off right now. 
[Transporter room]

SALAZAR: But there are six people still unaccounted
for. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Keep trying. 
[Bridge]

BARNABY: The Borg ship is powering up its weapons
array. 
CRUSHER: Come on, Chief. It's now or never. 
TAITT: They're preparing to fire. 
CRUSHER: Raise shields. 
BARNABY: The port nacelle's been hit. 
CRUSHER: Helm, get us out of here. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
BARNABY: We've lost warp engines. 
CRUSHER: Evasive manoeuvres, full impulse. 
(they sail past the massive Borg vessel) 
TAITT: Shields down to eighty percent. 
CRUSHER: Fire phasers. 
BARNABY: Direct hit. No damage to the Borg ship. 
TAITT: Shields down to seventy three percent. 
CRUSHER: What's the status of the warp engines? 
BARNABY: Still down. We can't outrun them. 
CRUSHER: Helm, set a new course, heading three four four mark six. Full
impulse. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Sir, that heading takes us directly into the sun. 
CRUSHER: The databanks should contain information about a process
called metaphasic shielding. 
BARNABY: I know about that research. Commander La Forge was developing
a programme
that would implement metaphasic properties. 
CRUSHER: Right. How far along was he? 
BARNABY: It's in the databanks but it's never been tested. 
CRUSHER: If we had metaphasic shielding, we could enter the sun's
corona but the Borg ship wouldn't be able to follow. Can you bring the
programme online? 
BARNABY: I can, but we have no way of knowing if the shields will hold.

TAITT: Sir, hull temperature is rising. Now at twelve thousand degrees
C. Radiation level nearing ten thousand rads. 
(weapons hit) 
CRUSHER: Report. 
TAITT: Shields at sixty two percent. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, activate the metaphasic programme. It's our best
shot. 
BARNABY: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Hull temperature is critical. We can't withstand this heat much
longer. 
BARNABY: Programme is online. Engaging metaphasic shield now. 
TAITT: Hull temperature dropping. Down to seven thousand degrees. 
CRUSHER: Maintain course. 
BARNABY: The Borg ship has broken off pursuit. 
CRUSHER: All stop. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg ship is taking up position relative to ours.
They're going to wait for us to come out. 
CRUSHER: The question is, how long can we survive in here?

[Holding cell]

PICARD: Well, I've done everything that Geordi
said. Now to activate it. 
TROI: How are we going to know whether the pulse reboots Data's ethical
programme? 
PICARD: We'll only tell that when we see his behaviour. 
TROI: Won't he realise something's happened to him? 
PICARD: No, it's one programme among thousands. I just hope this force
field has enough energy to trigger the pulse. 
(he slides the tiny device forward, and the blue is sucked into it)
