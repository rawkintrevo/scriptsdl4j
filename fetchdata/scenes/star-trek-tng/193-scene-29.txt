LAFORGE [OC]: I don't think we're going to pull
this one out. 
DATA: Reactor Nine will reach critical in ten minutes, forty three
seconds. The subsequent explosion will create a chain reaction along
the entire length of the Array, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, standby for a jump to warp two. 
ANAYA: Yes, Sir. 
RIKER: La Forge, you've got ten minutes. Mister Worf, Red alert. 
WORF: Aye, Commander.

BARCLAY: Computer, begin new programme. Create as
follows, workstation chair. (he sits in it) Now, create a standard
alphanumeric console positioned for left hand. Now an iconic display
console positioned for right hand. Tie both consoles into the
Enterprise main computer core, utilising neural-scan interface. 
COMPUTER: There is no such device on file. 
BARCLAY: No problem. Here's how you build it.

DATA: Argus reactor nine twenty eight seconds to
critical. 
RIKER: Get us out of here. 
PICARD: Warp two, Ensign. 
ANAYA: Yes, sir. Helm's not responding. 
WORF: Captain, we have lost computer control. 
RIKER: What? 
DATA: Twelve seconds to critical. 
PICARD: Go to manual. 
ANAYA: I'm attempting that, sir 
RIKER: There's not enough time. 
WORF: Computer is coming back online, sir. 
DATA: Captain, the Argus reactors are shutting down. We are no longer
in danger, sir. 
PICARD: What happened?

PICARD: Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut
down? 
BARCLAY [OC]: A neural interface was created to expedite the repairs. 
RIKER: Barclay? 
PICARD: Computer, respond. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I am responding, sir. I'm sorry if I caused you any
alarm. It was necessary in order to secure the Array.
