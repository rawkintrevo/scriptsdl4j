[Bridge]

(Worf enters) 
PICARD: Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has to arrived. They have
requested return of the renegades. 
WORF: They will be tried and executed, sir. 
PICARD: I know. Lieutenant, understand that I am not unmindful of the
mixed feelings you must have about this incident. 
WORF: Thank you, sir. Are there no other options, sir? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
RIKER: He seems to be handling this quite well, sir. 
PICARD: So far. He must be torn. These are his people. 
DATA: The Klingon vessel is within range, sir. They are requesting
visual contact. 
PICARD: Open frequencies. 
DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: We are in position now to receive the
criminals. 
PICARD: We're prepared to transfer. 
WORF: Captain. Request permission to address the Captain on the Klingon
vessel. I know it is against standard procedure, but there is something
I must say. 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
WORF: K'Mongi B'Mus. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: G'Armond T'Ris. What is it you want? 
WORF: To plead. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: You waste your time. Their actions threaten the
alliance. They disobeyed and must be punished. 
WORF: Yes, they must be punished, but not executed with dishonour. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: Why do you care? 
WORF: What burns in their eyes, fires my soul. I hear their words, and
I see it all as it was. Part of me longs for that time. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: It's bred in the bone. We all do. 
WORF: Then send them to a planet in the Halee system, where they can
meet death on their feet with a weapon in their hands, not tied and
helpless. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: When one of us dies that way it diminishes all
of us. 
WORF: Yes. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: Brother, I feel as you. I too wish they could
fly free, but I have no choice. 
WORF: Sir. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: We await the transfer. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter room. 
TASHA [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Brig]

(The prisoners are taking elements from their
belts, the hooks from their boots and building a gun of some sort. Then
Korris uses a metal piece to deactivate the forcefield)

[Corridor]

GUARD: This is Ramos. The forcefield in Security
Three has been broken. 
(He tries to go in, and gets shot) 
(Another guard dodges Konmel's shots and gets him, although it takes
three blasts to put him down. Korris uses Ramos's phaser to kill the
guard) 
TASHA: Lieutenant Yar to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

TASHA [OC]: There's been an escape. At least one of
my security is dead. 
[Corridor]

TASHA: So is Konmel. Korris is loose and armed. 
PICARD: Keep me informed, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, visual on K'Nera. 
DATA: Visual on, sir. 
PICARD: Captain, there will be a short delay. Korris has escaped. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: He is a trained Klingon warrior, Captain.
Perhaps more than you can handle. It is not a disgrace to request our
assistance. 
PICARD: I think we can handle the situation.

[Engineering]

(Korris runs in and sees the warp core. He heads up
a ladder. Tasha enters) 
CREWMAN: He's up there! 
TASHA: Captain, Korris is in main Engineering. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Korris.
