TROI: Worf. I was just talking with Mrs. Kyle the
primary school teacher. She told me you enrolled Alexander in her class
this morning. 
WORF: Yes. 
TROI: I'm sure he'll do very well. She's a wonderful teacher. 
WORF: Good. 
TROI: Did she tell you about the father-son field trip this afternoon? 
WORF: Yes. We cannot attend. 
TROI: Why not? 
WORF: I have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours. 
TROI: This would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of the
other students and parents. 
WORF: I might be able to reschedule the review. 
TROI: Good. I'll let them know you're coming.

(there are models, and things in display cases) 
KYLE: As the value of their horns increased, the number of white rhinos
in the wild kept falling, until they finally became extinct about two
centuries ago. Now, I'd like to show you a pair of animals we're trying
to save from extinction. Would you follow me? They're from Corvan Two,
where their homes in the rainforests are being threatened by industrial
pollutants. They're called Corvan gilvos. They're a little shy. 
(something moves in the cage) 
KYLE: The eating habits of gilvos are very similar to those of Earth's
Draco lizards, which died out over three hundred years ago. There
are only fourteen gilvos left on Corvan Two. We're transplanting these
two to the protected planet Brentalia, where they should thrive. Well,
why don't you all have a look around on your own for a while. If you
have any questions, please feel free to ask. 
(the others disperse, but Alexander is completely taken by the gilvos) 
KYLE: Alexander, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell everyone that the models
on the tables were for everyone to play with. So I guess you didn't
know you weren't supposed to take them. I saw you playing with the
lizard model a little while ago. Do you still have it? 
WORF: Are you accusing him of stealing? 
KYLE: Lieutenant Worf, I can only tell you that 
WORF: Alexander, did you take the model of the lizard from the table? 
ALEXANDER: No, sir. 
KYLE: Lieutenant, I saw Alexander put the model inside of his jacket. 
(Worf checks Alexander's pockets, and find it)

Alexander has acted shamefully, and as his father I must now deal with
him. But I find that I would gladly fight ten armed Baldur warriors
rather than face one small child.
