TIMOTHY TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER FELTON DATA

[Ready room]

PICARD: Timothy, can you tell us what happened to
your ship? 
TIMOTHY: I did tell you. 
TROI: Tell us again. 
TIMOTHY: We were attacked. 
DATA: That is highly unlikely. Our investigations have clearly
demonstrated 
TIMOTHY: We were attacked! We were attacked! 
DATA: Timothy, androids do not lie. 
TIMOTHY: It was me. 
DATA: Please explain. 
TIMOTHY: It was me. I did it. I killed them all. Everything was
shaking. I lost my balance. I was just trying to hold on to something.
I didn't mean to do it. 
PICARD: What was it that didn't you mean to do, Timothy? 
TIMOTHY: My arm hit the computer panel. That's what destroyed the ship.

TROI: The ship was damaged when your arm hit the computer panel?
Timothy, listen to me. The damage to your ship might have occurred at
the same time your arm touched the panel, but it was only a
coincidence. This wasn't your fault. 
TIMOTHY: Yes it was. 
DATA: It is not possible. The onboard control systems for every
starship require a user code clearance. You could not have
inadvertently affected any of the Vico's systems. 
PICARD: Your computer had safety precautions. There is nothing you
could have touched that would have damaged your ship. 
TROI: You're not responsible for what happened to your parents,
Timothy. 
TIMOTHY: But if it wasn't me 
PICARD: We're trying to determine what happened right now, and if there
is anything you can remember that may assist 
(they shake from a wavefront) 
TIMOTHY: That's just how it was when it started on the Vico. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased. 
RIKER: Increase shields to seventy five percent. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(a big wave sets off alarms) 
RIKER: Damage, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Minimal, sir. Shields are holding. 
(Picard, Timothy and Troi enter) 
PICARD: Ensign, full about. Go to warp two. 
FELTON: The gravitational distortion is too high. We can't maintain a
warp field. 
PICARD: Full shields. 
WORF: Aye. 
FELTON: Captain, impulse power has been disrupted. The helm won't
respond. 
TIMOTHY: We couldn't get out either. 
TROI: Timothy, perhaps you and I should go below and get out of
everyone's way. 
TIMOTHY: No. 
RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you give me more power to the shields? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Stand by. 
TIMOTHY: That's what they kept saying. More shields, more shields. 
DATA: Timothy, accompany me, please. (go to science station) I want you
to recall everything you heard people say aboard the Vico before it was
destroyed. 
TIMOTHY: I don't know. Just that. Just more shields. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, I've transferred 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Fusion reactors four through nine into the
shield array. That should double the shield strength.

[Bridge]

WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased by an order
of magnitude. Impact in three, two, one. 
(very big hit) 
WORF: Wave front intensity is continuing to increase. Structural
over-pressure now exceeding one hundred eighty percent. 
PICARD: La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I don't understand. That should have been enough.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We could run the shield grid directly off
the warp drive.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead, Commander. 
WORF: Initiating warp-transfer pathways now. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Diverting warp power to the shields. 
TIMOTHY: Warp power to the shields. They said that too, Data. I'm
positive. 
WORF: Wavefront intensity has increased by a factor of ten. Contact in
thirty one seconds. Without additional power to the shields, the outer
hull will not hold. 
RIKER: La Forge? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Warp transfer to the shields complete. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: That's as strong as they're going to
get. 
WORF: Impact in fifteen seconds. 
(Data finishes running his analysis) 
DATA: Sir, drop the shields. 
RIKER: That's suicide, Data. 
DATA: Captain, drop the shields. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
WORF: Aye. 
(a very gently ripple rocks the ship) 
DATA: Our own shields caused the increases in the wavefronts, sir. We
have been experiencing a harmonic amplification effect. 
RIKER: The more energy we dumped into the shield grid, the worse the
impact. 
DATA: Precisely. That is also what destroyed the Vico. When Timothy
remembered similar procedures on his ship, I initiated an analysis of
shield output to wavefront amplitude and discovered a correlation. 
PICARD: If we had transferred all that warp power to the shields, it
would have torn the ship apart. 
RIKER: Status, Ensign? 
FELTON: Navigation is coming back online. 
PICARD: Full about, one quarter impulse. Take us out of here.
