[Laboratory]

PICARD: Responsible for the death of the Raman's
crew? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but I don't think it was on purpose. They probably tried
communicating with them the same way they're communicating with me, by
directly accessing their thoughts. It must've been fatal to the crew. I
guess the interface is what protected me.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I have to take them back, Captain. They
can't survive so far up in the atmosphere. I'll turn the ship around
and come back as soon as I'm 
(rumble, bang, flash) 
[Laboratory]

PICARD: Geordi, what's happening? 
LAFORGE: The atmosphere is getting more turbulent. It's overloading the
systems. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I'm having difficulty keeping the shields
up. 
SILVA: Geordi. We're safe now. Goodbye. 
(she turns into flame and goes through the bulkhead. BANG!) 
LAFORGE: I'm losing power. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: Total shield failure in eight seconds. 
PICARD: Can we switch the input? 
CRUSHER: Almost.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: Shields are failing! 
(and the ship is falling apart) 
[Laboratory]

CRUSHER: Switching inputs. 
(Geordi has gone rigid. Beverly gives him a hypo) 
PICARD: Is it working? 
CRUSHER: His vital signs are stabilising. He's going to make it.

Captain's log, supplemental. We have succeeded in
disengaging Mister La Forge from the interface and are en route to
Starbase four nine five.
