[Sickbay]

(O'Brien has a bad elbow) 
CRUSHER: Nothing broken, Chief, but the ligaments around the elbow have
been twisted pretty severely. What on earth were you doing when you
fell? 
O'BRIEN: Hanging a plant for Keiko. It's part of her running project to
give me a green thumb. 
CRUSHER: How's it working? 
O'BRIEN: Everything I touch seems to turn brown and wither away. 
CRUSHER: Alyssa, would you get me? Oh, never mind, I'll get it. You,
don't go away. 
[Sickbay lab]

(during the opening log, Beverly had been doing
something scientific with modules. Now she sees them again, full of
fuzzy pink stuff) 
CRUSHER: This isn't possible.

CRUSHER: Alyssa? 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Did you see anybody near the lab today? 
OGAWA: No, I didn't. 
CRUSHER: You didn't by chance adjust the environments on the incubation
containers? 
OGAWA: I would never touch one of your experiments unless you asked me
to, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Of course not. I'm sorry, Alyssa. Thank you.

WORF: Probe approaching the T-tauri system,
Captain. 
PICARD: Readings, Data? 
DATA: Coming in now, sir. The probe is within visual range of the
planet. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(the planet is green) 
DATA: Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium composition with a frozen
helium core. 
RIKER: Wait a minute. Didn't your readings indicate a class M planet
before we passed through the wormhole, Data? 
DATA: It is possible the sensors were affected by interference from the
wormhole, Commander. It is clearly not a class M planet. 
PICARD: Mister Data, run a full diagnostic to make sure the wormhole
didn't permanently damage the sensors. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, take us back on a course 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Problem, Number One? 
RIKER: It seems awfully strange that a malfunctioning sensor would give
such a specific misreading of a planet. I would have thought that a
time-space disturbance would have caused a lot more confusion than
that. 
DATA: It is conceivable that the sensors picked up the afterimage of an
actual planet on the other side of the wormhole. We could survey the
nearby stars for such a planet. It would require approximately six
days, sir. 
PICARD: No, no, we don't have time for that. We've encountered a minor
mystery, one that has been solved to my satisfaction. Number One,
unless there's a major objection, then Ensign McKnight should put us
back on course for Evadne Four. 
RIKER: No objection. 
PICARD: Ensign. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir.
