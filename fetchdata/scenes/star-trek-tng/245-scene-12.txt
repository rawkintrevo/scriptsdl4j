[Jefferies tube]

(Picard and Nella are both in casual clothes, going
up the ladders) 
NELLA: Keep climbing. 
PICARD: Where are we going? 
NELLA: We're almost there. 
PICARD: I don't see why we couldn't just practice in my quarters. 
(they sit at an intersection) 
NELLA: Do you know where we are? 
PICARD: Yes, this is the fourth intersect in Jefferies tube twenty
five. 
NELLA: No, this is the most acoustically perfect spot on the ship. 
(she starts up the Moonlight Sonata on her keyboard) 
NELLA: The intersection acts as a resonance chamber. 
PICARD: How did you find it? 
NELLA: A little exploring. 
PICARD: You mean to say you climbed through every tube on the ship? 
NELLA: Well, not every one. Try it. See how it sounds. 
(he plays what seems like a variation of the Skye Boat song) 
NELLA: That's beautiful. What is it? 
PICARD: It's an old folk melody. 
NELLA: I've never heard you play with such feeling. 
(she plays the tune and he joins in)

[Engineering]

(Geordi can hear the music, and goes into the main
Jefferies tube access to investigate) 
DATA: Is there a problem, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I hear music. 
DATA: Music? I do not hear anything. 
LAFORGE: Are you sure? I know I heard something. Oh, it's stopped. 
(because the musicians are kissing)

[Turbolift]

NELLA: I'd heard about Kerelian tenors all my life,
but nothing could've prepared me for this man's voice. Soaring,
incredible range. Wonderful. 
PICARD: I understand there are nuances that only Kerelians can pick up.
We just don't have the ears for it. 
(a crewwoman enters) 
NELLA: I should be finished with my survey by eleven hundred hours. 
PICARD: Very good, Commander.
