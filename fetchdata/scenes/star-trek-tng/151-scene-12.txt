[Bridge]

WESLEY: Warp eight point five. Warp nine. The
warship continues to match our acceleration curve perfectly. 
PICARD: Number One, I have the distinct impression that we're being
toyed with. Take us back to Rana Four. 
RIKER: Back? 
PICARD: We have unfinished business there. I need to have a talk with
those two people. You have the Bridge. 
RIKER: Reduce speed. Bring us around on a return course. This one's
getting away.

[Garden]

(Picard and Worf beam is as Kevin and Rishon are
tending some shrubs) 
PICARD: Good afternoon. I'm sorry if I startled you. I'm Jean-Luc
Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. I have brought you something you
will need if you're going to stay on Rana Four. It's a matter
replicator. It has limited capabilities, but 
KEVIN: Thank you, but we have no use for such a thing. 
PICARD: It will provide you with clothing, food and clean water.
Lieutenant Worf demonstrate its operation. 
KEVIN: We don't need it. 
RISHON: Kevin, you know we do. Thank you, Captain. Kevin and I were
about to have afternoon tea. You and Mister Worf must join us. 
PICARD: I'd like that very much. 
KEVIN: Rishon, they only want to spy on us like this morning. 
RISHON: Kevin Uxbridge, I have never turned anyone away from this
house, and I'm not going to start now. Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Stop! Stop! Please, I'll do anything! Make it
stop! 
(Crusher enters the darkened room) 
CRUSHER: Please. I'm here to help. 
TROI: It's so loud! It's getting louder! Please, I can't stand it. Make
it stop! 
CRUSHER: Move her to the bed. 
(two assistants get Troi out of the chair) 
CRUSHER: This will help you relax. 
TROI: I hear it. It's still there! It's so loud! 
CRUSHER: Take her to Sickbay. 
TROI: No, I want to stay in my quarters. 
CRUSHER: I can get you to sleep. 
TROI: I don't want to sleep. The music will only follow me. 
CRUSHER: I can induce delta sleep. Lock out even your deepest dreams. 
TROI: It's not a dream. It's real.
