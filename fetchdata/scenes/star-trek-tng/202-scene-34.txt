WORF: The Tamarian and the entity are in close
proximity. The Tamarian's lifesigns are fluctuating. 
RIKER: The scattering field is still in full force. What the hell is
wrong with them? Their sensors can read what's going on as well as ours
can. Riker to O'Brien. Report.

O'BRIEN: The field's still deflecting the signal.
There just isn't enough of him, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Open a channel to the Tamarian ship. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

TAMARIAN [on viewscreen]: Kailash. When it rises. 
WORF: They have closed the channel. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to Bridge.
