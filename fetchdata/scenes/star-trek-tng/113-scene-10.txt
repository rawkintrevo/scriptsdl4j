(It has been raining, the tarmac glistens and cars
sound their horns) 
VENDOR: Extra! Extra! Read all about it. 
(The group cross the street to the news stand) 
VENDOR: Hey Dix. How's tricks? 
PICARD: Oh, she's fine, fine. 
WHALEN: He actually thinks you're Dixon Hill. 
PICARD: Say Mac, I would like to buy a newspaper too, but I don't have
any money. 
VENDOR: You catch me next time, Dix. 
PICARD: Thank you. (reads) Hitler on the move. Roosevelt presses
Congress for British aid. DiMaggio streak reaches thirty seven? 
DATA: DiMaggio, sir. Jolting Joe, the Yankee clipper. 
WHALEN: Baseball, sir. It was a national obsession at the time. 
DATA: The streak they refer to will eventually reach fifty six games.
And be snapped by a pair of journeyman hurlers for the Cleveland
Indians. 
VENDOR: Cleveland? Ha! They got no pitchers! They ain't never got no
pitchers. What are you, nuts or something? 
DATA: The record will stand until the year 2026, when a shortstop for
the London Kings 
VENDOR: Hey Dix, what gives with this guy? He's not from around here,
is he. 
PICARD: No he's not. He's er, he's from South America. 
VENDOR: Yeah. He's got a nice tan. 
(Picard reads the inside headline - Wealthy Socialite Murdered. Police
have several leads in brutal slaying of Mrs. Arthur Clinton Bradley) 
PICARD: I should have listened to her. She told me someone was trying
to kill her. 
WHALEN: Captain, she's a page from a book. That's all she ever was. 
BELL: Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. 
DATA: Cat? 
BELL: Where the hell did he come from? 
VENDOR: South America. Can't you tell? 
BELL: Wherever you're from, while you're in my town, keep your nose
clean. Well, tough guy, this time you've really done it. Your goose is
cooked but good. 
MCNARY: I'm sorry about this, Dix. 
BELL: Don't apologise to him. Where were you last night between ten and
midnight? 
PICARD: That would be a bit hard to explain. 
BELL: Yeah? Well you'll have plenty of time to come up with something.
You're going downtown. 
PICARD: What for? 
BELL: For the murder of Jessica Bradley. We found this in her purse.

RIKER: Status report. 
TASHA: We're being probed, sir. 
TROI: The Jarada. 
TASHA: Most likely, but it's long range. Can't be certain where it's
originating.
(The ship shakes as a beam passes through it, including the holodeck,
whose controls flicker and door briefly opens and closes a few times) 
RIKER: One could get the feeling they don't exactly trust us. 
LAFORGE: Commander, I'm receiving a subspace message from the Jarada. 
RIKER: That's not part of the plan. Pipe it through. 
JARADAN [OC]: En-ter-prise. We speak to you in your language. The time
has come to honour us in ours. 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker, First Officer of the Enterprise. 
JARADAN [OC]: You are not captain? 
RIKER: No sir, I'm not. I suggest we commence with screen to screen
communication so we can see each other 
JARADAN [OC]: You offend us! We will not show ourselves to a mere
subordinate. We await your Captain's greeting with growing unrest. End
of communication. 
RIKER: Terrific. Find the Captain. He's in the Holodeck. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
