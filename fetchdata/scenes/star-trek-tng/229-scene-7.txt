ALKAR TROI MAYLOR RIKER WORF

[Turbolift]

ALKAR: Deck nine. If I were empathic like you, I'd
have a real advantage.
TROI: I thought Lumerians were empathic.
ALKAR: Only with each other, not other species. So, I don't have any
idea what you might be feeling just now.
TROI: Curiosity. What I sense from you is very unusual. Calmness,
serenity, tranquillity. You seem to embody the very qualities that you
hope to draw out in others.

[Corridor]

ALKAR: Tell me, Counsellor, have you ever been
involved in diplomatic negotiations?
TROI: Several times with Captain Picard. There have been instances when
having an empath along has been helpful.
ALKAR: I'm sure. I could use some of that help. Would you come with me
when we reach Seronia?
TROI: If the Captain authorises it, of course I will.
ALKAR: Good. I hope to see you again.
(the door opens) 
MAYLOR: You're late.
ALKAR: Mother, I told you that I'd be gone for over an hour.
MAYLOR: You're late because of her. Have you mated with him yet?
TROI: What?
MAYLOR: That's what you want, isn't it?
ALKAR: Mother, please, come in. 
MAYLOR: I can always tell. The ones with a certain look in their eye. 
TROI: I'd better go.
MAYLOR: And I'll tell you this. If you do, you'll regret it the rest of
your life.
ALKAR: Mother. come in please. You should lie down. 
[Troi's office]

TROI: Come in.
RIKER: Hi. It's that time again. The dreaded crew evaluation reports.
TROI: Does it have to be today?
RIKER: It's not going to be any easier tomorrow.
TROI: It might.
RIKER: What's wrong?
TROI: I've just had a disturbing encounter with Alkar's mother. She
frightens me, Will. The feelings I sense from her are malevolent.
They're out of proportion. They're evil.
RIKER: I know she's been sick. She's very old. She's probably senile.
Who knows, we could all end up that way some day.
TROI: You're right. Okay, let's get through these evaluations, and when
they're done I'm going to reward myself with two ice cream sundaes.
RIKER: First, molecular biology. Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis. 
WORF [OC]: Worf to Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Go ahead.
WORF [OC]: Can you report to Ambassador Alkar's quarters? There is an
emergency. 
RIKER: We're on our way.
