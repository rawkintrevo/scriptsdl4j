RIKER CRUSHER TASHA PICARD TROI PULASKI KLAG QUINN ARMUS DATA KARGAN

[Skin of Evil]

TASHA: We're not going without our shuttle crew. 
ARMUS: I warn you. 
TASHA: Enough! We have people who need attention. We won't hurt you,
but we must help them. 
(Armus lets lose a bolt of energy which sends Tasha flying a long way.
Riker and Data's phasers have no effect on Armus)
PICARD [OC]: Number One! 
RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. 
DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. 
RIKER: We had no effect on it. 
(Armus sinks back into the slick) 
PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! 
CRUSHER: She's dead.

[The Child - Troi's quarters]

PULASKI: I'm losing life signs. 
TROI: You must save him. 
PULASKI: I'm sorry. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Growth rate has definitely slowed. What is
he feeling? Can you tell? 
TROI: Sadness. 
PULASKI: Which is the opposite of before, and it's having the opposite
effect on the infection. 
TROI: Then your theory's correct. The organisms are sensitive to
different types of endorphins. 
PULASKI: And negative emotions 
TROI: Such as sadness 
PULASKI: Produce endorphins that inhibit the organisms' growth. 
TROI: Then we've found a way to repel the infection. 
PULASKI: Assuming we're not too late already. 
TROI: How much time do we have? 
PULASKI: I'm not sure. His vital signs are getting weaker. I don't want
to risk another dose of tricordrazine unless I have to. I must refocus
the pattern again. We need to isolate memories that generate stronger
negative emotions.

[A Matter of Honour - Pagh Bridge]

I know I can count on every Klingon warrior in this
crew to serve and die in that battle. So I ask you again, Commander
Riker. Where are your loyalties? 
RIKER: I have been assigned to serve this ship and to obey your orders.
And I will do exactly that. 
KARGAN: Will you take an oath to that effect? 
RIKER: I just did. 
KLAG: (in Klingon) Do not believe him! He lies! 
KARGAN: (in Klingon) Speak in their language. This is your Second
Officer, Lieutenant Klag. 
RIKER: Is there something you wanted to say to me, Lieutenant? 
KLAG: Yes sir. I do not believe you. 
RIKER: Then I take it you challenge my authority over you. 
KLAG: Correct. 
RIKER: And your position on this, Captain? 
KARGAN: I would say it your first command decision. 
(Riker looks around and thumps Klag in the stomach before throwing him
on the floor, then kicking him down before he can get up again, and
finally ramming his head into a computer panel. Lots of sparks. Kargan
laughs)

[Conspiracy - Quinn's quarters]

RIKER: Ready for your tour, Admiral? 
QUINN: Quite ready, Commander. 
RIKER: What's in the case? 
QUINN: Actually, I brought it for Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you would
like you to see it first? 
RIKER: What is it? 
QUINN: A form of life. It was discovered accidentally by a survey team
on an uncharted planet. 
RIKER: Why haven't we heard anything about that? 
QUINN: Oh, you'll be hearing about it shortly, but first there remains
much scientific study to be done. After all, it is a superior form of
life. 
RIKER: Superior? 
QUINN: Totally. Come, have a look. 
RIKER: I think I'll summon my Science Officer. 
(Quinn grabs his arm with a surprising amount of strength) 
QUINN: It won't like your Science Officer. It does like you! Vitamins.
They do wonders for the body. 
(There's a very one-sided fight - Quinn easily throws Riker around the
room)
RIKER: Riker to Security. Guest quarters seventeen. Emergency. 
(Quinn knocks Riker out cold)
