TASHA: Set phasers to stun. 
TROI: I wish they weren't necessary. 
DATA: A justified precaution, Counsellor. Mistress Beata observed that
Mister Ramsey and his men are dangerous. 
TASHA: Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Go ahead, Tasha. 
TASHA: Three to beam to the location of that platinum trace, Geordi. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Coordinates set. 
TASHA: Energise. 
[Hideout]

TROI: Tasha! 
(Below them is a cave and settlement, and a man at a table) 
RAMSEY: Welcome. I've been expecting you. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Picard to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

(Worf sneezes) 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Status report. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir. Doctor
Crusher's converted the holodeck into an isolation ward. 
PICARD: And the away team? 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Well, no recent contact, sir, but I have
informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing Romulan
threat to our Neutral Zone outpost. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge until
Commander Riker returns. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Engineering reports a computer malf (sneeze)
I'm sorry, I'm getting sick. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure half the ship knows that by now. Report to Sickbay,
Lieutenant. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to bridge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: The computer won't accept the variant climate controls. 
LAFORGE: On my way. 
WORF: With all respect, Lieutenant, there are people to do that job
now. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Engineering. Lieutenant Wong knows the system. I'm
sure she'll be able to resolve all problems. Worf, thanks for the
advice. 
[Hideout]

RAMSEY: How did you find me? 
DATA: Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no platinum.
Enterprise scanners did the rest. 
RAMSEY: Platinum, was it? My wings. I kept them for their sentimental
value. 
TASHA: Where are the other survivors, Mister Ramsey? 
RAMSEY: Oh, they're nearby. They're packing, as a matter of fact, since
we can no longer remain here. 
TROI: Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no anticipation, no
excitement
at being rescued. 
RAMSEY: What is it that you think you're rescuing me from? My shipmates
and I have all taken wives. A few even have children. You can't rescue
a man from a place that he calls his home.
