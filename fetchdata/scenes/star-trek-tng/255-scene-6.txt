RIKER CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Jefferies tube]

LAFORGE: Something's wrong. Can't get my left leg
to work.

[Laboratory]

RIKER: What is it? 
CRUSHER: The probe is designed to respond to any movement Geordi
intends to make. When his brain sends a message to move his leg, the
interface should move the probe instead. 
DATA: Apparently the tactile sensors are too low. I will increase the
input. 
[Jefferies tube]

LAFORGE: There it goes. I'm on my way down.

[Laboratory]

RIKER: Why the body suit? 
DATA: It provides tactile sensations so that Geordi can feel he's in
the same environment as the probe. 
(Geordi is 'walking' past a panel and sees the probe as his reflection.
He leans forward to examine it) 
CRUSHER: Geordi, what's wrong? 
LAFORGE: Nothing. I'm seeing my reflection in a panel. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I forgot what a handsome guy I am.

Captain's log, stardate 47215.5. We are responding
to a distress call from the science vessel Raman, which is apparently
trapped inside the turbulent atmosphere of an unusual gas giant planet.
We will use an experimental interface probe in our attempt to rescue
it.
