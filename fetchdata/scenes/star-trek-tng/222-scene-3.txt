[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We've got elevated quantities of hydrogen,
helium and trionium, but nothing the shields can't handle. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
PICARD: Take us in, Ensign. One quarter impulse. 
FELTON: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

(a red firefly flits around then goes through a
closed door) 
DATA: In order for the lateral sensors to complete their scheduled
observations, additional processing time will be required. 
LAFORGE: We could steal a couple of hours from the Engineering team
while they're recalibrating the thermal interferometery scanner. 
DATA: Will two hours be enough time to complete the high-resolution
series on the neutron star? 
LAFORGE: No problem. We'll just double up the main sensor bandwidth
while they're freeing up the lateral unit. 
(the firefly follows for a while then goes down another corridor)

CRUSHER: And then after dinner, then what? 
OGAWA: We went to the holodeck and took a walk on the Champs Elysees. 
CRUSHER: The neural scanner still seems to be a bit off. Let's check
the sensor calibrations. 
OGAWA: I'll run a diagnostic. 
(the firefly is there) 
CRUSHER: And? 
OGAWA: And? 
CRUSHER: After Paris? 
OGAWA: He has shore leave next month. He asked me to go to Risa with
him. 
CRUSHER: No problem. Nurse McClukidge can cover for you. 
OGAWA: I don't think I'm going, Doctor. I hear it's a very uninhibited
atmosphere. Personally, I don't think I'm ready for that kind of fun. 
CRUSHER: Try to talk him into Tavena Minor. They have a cruise down the
Jokri River. The iridescent currents are beautiful.
