[Interrogation room]

BELL: And you say you never met her before she came
to hire you. 
PICARD: I've already told you that twice. 
BELL: Yeah? Well you're going to have to tell me again. 
PICARD: Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. 
MCNARY: Easy, Dan! 
BELL: You think you're tough, Hill, but you're nothing! 
(Bell leaves) 
MCNARY: Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving
him a hard time. You know how it is. 
PICARD: Actually, I do need to get out of here. 
MCNARY: I'll see what I can do.

[Police station]

(Crusher is continuing to try and imitate the other
women, this time by powdering her nose. The Desk Sergeant is enjoying
the view) 
CRUSHER: Something on your mind? 
SERGEANT: Yeah, nut I'm not sure it can be repeated in mixed company.
(he offers her gum) You're a pretty hep lookin' broad. 
CRUSHER: Is that good? 
SERGEANT: It ain't bad. You like Tommy Dorsey? (she nods) I got two
tickets for the dance tomorrow night. 
(Crusher swallows the gum) 
[Outside Holodeck]

RIKER: Have you tried the intercom? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
RIKER: Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! 
(Wesley takes a piece of equipment and uses it to 'look' at the
holodeck controls) 
RIKER: Are you seeing anything? 
WESLEY: No, sir. 
RIKER: What can I do? 
LAFORGE: Not a thing. We have to go through this millimetre by
millimetre. 
RIKER: All right. Get it fixed. 
LAFORGE: Easy, Wes. Slow it down. If there's an anomaly, you could go
right past it, okay?
