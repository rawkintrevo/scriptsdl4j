RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY SECURITY CRUSHER DATA ETANA

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We've got him, Captain. Section twenty
five. It looks like he's trying to cut through the forcefield with a
phaser. 
PICARD: Security to deck six, section twenty five. 
SECURITY [OC]: On our way.

[Corridor]

(Wesley hides as security come out of the
turbolift) 
SECURITY: You check left. 
(the security man turns off the phaser)

[Engineering]

RIKER: Where the hell is he? 
WORF: I am attempting to isolate him with thermal sensors. 
RIKER: Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck if you have to. 
WORF: Unfortunately, he knows our procedures. He will avoid corridors
and public areas. Commander, an unidentified heat source. Deck seven,
section twenty three. There.

[Jefferies tube]

(Wesley crawls along, only to meet Worf coming the
other way. He turns and dashes back again but gets trapped between Worf
and Riker at an intersection) 
WESLEY: No! Let go of me! 
[Bridge]

(Wesley is hauled onto the Bridge) 
CRUSHER: It's okay, Wesley. 
PICARD: You led us quite a chase, Mister Crusher. Doctor Crusher. 
WESLEY: No! 
PICARD: Hold him steady. 
CRUSHER: It's okay, Wesley. It won't hurt. 
WESLEY: (as they put the game on him) No! 
CRUSHER: You'll like it. 
PICARD: His eyes. 
(Worf and Riker pull his eyelids open, and the game plays itself) 
CRUSHER: That's right, Wesley. just let it go. Yes, just let yourself
go. Relax. 
(the Bridge lights dim and Data enters. He shines a strobing flashlight
into everyone's faces and they 'wake up') 
DATA: Computer, resume normal illumination. 
(Wesley rips the game off) 
DATA: Mister Worf, you will find a small alien ship off the starboard
bow. Please secure it with a tractor beam and raise our shields. 
WORF: Engaging tractor beam. 
DATA: Are you all right, Captain? 
PICARD: I think so, Mister Data. 
WORF: Captain, we are being hailed by the alien vessel. 
PICARD: On screen. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Explain yourself, Picard. 
PICARD: The explanation is simple. Your attempt to capture our ship has
failed. 
ETANA [on viewscreen]: Release us immediately, or we will open fire. 
RIKER: Tactical analysis, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Their weapons systems are substantially inferior to ours. They
are not a threat. 
RIKER: Get her off the screen. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe what we were about to do. 
RIKER: Data, we deactivated you. 
WESLEY: I managed to reconnect his positronic matrix. 
DATA: Wesley's subsequent diversions gave me adequate time to modify
the palm beacon. The optical burst patterns we
programmed were successful in counteracting the addictive effects of
the game. 
PICARD: And the rest of the crew? 
DATA: We programmed the main computer to transmit the same optical
burst to all display screens, work stations and terminals throughout
the ship. 
RIKER: That should reach almost everyone. Take a medical team to treat
the rest. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: We'll take the alien ship to the nearest Federation starbase.
Ensign, lay in a course.

Captain's log, stardate 45212.1. We have delivered
the Ktarian vessel to Starbase eighty two and are now on a course to
rendezvous with the Starship Merrimack, which will transport Wesley
Crusher back to Starfleet Academy.
