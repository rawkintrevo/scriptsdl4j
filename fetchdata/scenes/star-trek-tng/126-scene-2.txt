DATA WORF

[Derelict ship]

DATA: Minimal oxygen atmosphere. An ancient solar
generator, still operating. 
WORF: Commander, look at this. 
DATA: The on-board computers have ceased functioning. I may be able to
download this old style disk drive back to the Enterprise. 
(Worf tries to walk through the next hatch, but it does not
automatically open for him) 
WORF: It must be sealed, probably with age. (he prepares his phaser) 
DATA: Not necessary. 
(Data pulls the lever and the doorway opens)

[Cryo chamber]

(This module of the ship contains frost-covered
capsules in groups of three, both sides of the passageway. Data scrapes
the frost off the first to view a skull) 
DATA: The seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted. 
WORF: Here's another. 
DATA: This one is empty. 
WORF: Commander, look at this. 
(They look at the face of a woman. Other capsules reveal two men still
intact) 
WORF: Were they frozen for an extended journey? 
DATA: If that were the purpose, there would be evidence of a more
sophisticated monitoring system. These containers were designed solely
for refrigeration.
