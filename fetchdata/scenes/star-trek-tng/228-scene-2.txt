PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge, can we beam an away
team onto the science ship?
LAFORGE: We can beam them over there, Captain, but with all this
interference, we might not get a positive lock to bring them back. 
BARCLAY: Commander, if we bridged our transporter system with theirs we
might be able to cut through the ionic field. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea, Barclay. Captain, I think we can do it.
We're going to bridge the two transporter systems. 
PICARD [OC]: Acknowledged. Meet Commander Riker in Transporter room
three. 
LAFORGE: Aye sir. Barclay, I'm going to need a systems engineer on this
Away Team. 
BARCLAY: I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you. 
LAFORGE: I meant you, Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Shouldn't I stay here and set up the remote link? 
LAFORGE: Dern can do that. Come on, let's go.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Status, Mister O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN: I'll have to send you over one at a time, Commander, because
of band width limitations, and the transport cycle will take a little
longer. 
RIKER: How much longer? 
O'BRIEN: Four, five seconds. About twice the normal time. I'm afraid
you're in for a bumpy ride, Commander.
BARCLAY: What do you? What exactly do you mean by a bumpy ride? 
O'BRIEN: There may be a small amount of static charge accumulation.
You'll feel a bit of tingling. It's nothing to worry about. 
RIKER: Let's do it. Mister Worf. 
(Worf gets onto the pad) 
O'BRIEN: Engaging system interlock. Pattern buffers synchronised. Phase
transition coils at stand by. Energising. He's there. 
RIKER: I'll go next. 
(Barclay's panic levels are steadily mounting) 
O'BRIEN: Engaging interlock. Buffers synched. Energising. 
CRUSHER: I'm ready. 
O'BRIEN: Engaging interlock. Buffers synched. Oh, wait a minute. I'm
reading an ionic fluctuation in the matter stream. Oh, no problem.
Okay. Energising. 
LAFORGE: Reg, you're up. Reg. 
BARCLAY: Aye, sir. 
O'BRIEN: Engaging interlock. Buffers in synch. Phase coils 
BARCLAY: I'm sorry, I just can't do this. 
(and Reg leaves the transporter room)
