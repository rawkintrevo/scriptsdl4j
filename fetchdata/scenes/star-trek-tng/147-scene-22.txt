RIKER
[OC]: It's the effort that counts.

PICARD:
Open.
(hailing frequencies) 
KOLRAMI: I believe the rules are understood by all. 
PICARD: The weapons conversion, Lieutenant Burke? 
(played by Glenn Morshower - as seen in CSI and 24) 
BURKE: (at Worf's station) Complete, Captain. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Signal received. Locked on. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: She's really been stripped down, Captain. 
KOLRAMI: The only offensive systems you'll need will be simulated by
computer. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: What's the Zakdornian word for mismatch? 
KOLRAMI: Challenge. We do not whine about the inequities of life. And
how you perform in a mismatch is precisely what is of interest to
Starfleet. After all, when one is in the superior position, one is
expected to win. 
PICARD: Screen off. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Picard leaves) 
KOLRAMI: Lieutenant Commander Data, I am intrigued by your challenge.
Doctor Pulaski informed me of your desire to play a game of Strategema.

DATA: But I expressed no such interest. 
PULASKI: What Commander Data means is that he would never have asked
you himself, but I know he's very interested in pitting his skill
against yours. 
KOLRAMI: Play against a machine. Why should I wish to? 
PULASKI: I don't blame you. It's no fun going into a game when you know
you're going to lose. 
KOLRAMI: But I wouldn't lose. Now you're no doubt going to tell me that
I have to prove it to you. 
PULASKI: Come on, Data, you can't let that pass. 
DATA: Indeed, I. (pause) Cannot. 
KOLRAMI: Then you will play for the honour of your ship. 
PULASKI: The honour of the ship? It's your reputation that's on the
line.

WORF:
With my knowledge of the Enterprise's security override, we may be able
to convince the sensors that an enemy ship is approaching. Their
instruments would lie to them.
RIKER: If you can pull that off, Mister Worf, it might just give us the
edge we're looking for. 
NAGEL: (a lady officer) But what about the viewscreen? 
WORF: If I am successful, the computer will project a false image of
the enemy ship on the main viewscreen. 
RIKER: So unless someone runs to a window and looks out 
NAGEL: They're going to fall for it.

(We
are
looking out from the warp core.)
WESLEY: The lining's still smooth. We should to be able to do something
with these dilithium fragments we scavenged. 
LAFORGE: Sure, the system is functional. But without antimatter, what
difference does it make? 
WESLEY: Geordi, I have to return to the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Wes, we've only got thirty two hours. 
WESLEY: This is important. 
LAFORGE: And this isn't?

WORF:
Attempt the routing bypass here. If it works, they will be surprised.
NAGEL: Where am I going to get the opticable? 
(Worf reaches up and pulls down a handful of fibreoptics) 
WORF: Anywhere. 
WESLEY: Captain? I left an experiment running back on the Enterprise.
May I go back and shut it down? 
RIKER: It's that important? 
WESLEY: It has to be monitored. And it is my final grade in plasma
physics.

BURKE:
Message from the Hathaway, sir.
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Request permission for Ensign Crusher to reboard
the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Why? 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Apparently he was so anxious to be join the away
team, he left a very critical experiment unattended. 
PICARD: Have you any objection? 
KOLRAMI: He should be escorted, and have no contact with anything save
his research. 
PICARD: Permission granted. Mister Burke, will you handle that? 
BURKE: Aye, sir. 
KOLRAMI: I saw no sense in Riker choosing him anyway. Just a
non-commissioned child.
