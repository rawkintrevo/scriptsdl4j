KURN RIKER OBRIEN GOWRON KULGE WORF PICARD

[Great Hall]

KURN: Our forces in the Mempa sector are now in
full retreat. They will need to regroup near Beta Lankal. 
GOWRON: We destroyed their supply bases in that sector three weeks ago.
How can they continue to fight? 
KURN: They must be getting help. 
KULGE: Maybe they have better leaders. I say you have failed as our
leader, Gowron. 
(and he draws his dagger) 
WORF: There is no time for this! We must make plans before those forces
reach Beta Lankal! How can we oppose the Duras when
we continue to fight among ourselves? 
KURN: Gowron must answer a challenge to his authority. 
WORF: Stop it! Do we to fall upon ourselves like a pack of Ferengi? The
enemy is the Duras. We are at war! 
(Worf steps between the fighters and Gowron takes the opportunity to
kill Kulge) 
GOWRON: Now the war can continue.

[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: We're crossing into Klingon territory,
Captain. 
PICARD: Signal the fleet to maintain yellow alert until further notice.

O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Begin long range scans of the Romulan border. 
O'BRIEN: No uncloaked ships within sensor range. A few subspace
anomalies, but nothing firm. 
PICARD: Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. 
O'BRIEN: Could be, sir. 
PICARD: Open a channel to the Excalibur. 
RIKER [OC]: Excalibur, Riker here. 
PICARD: Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir.
