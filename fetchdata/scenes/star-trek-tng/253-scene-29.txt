(at an aft station)
TAITT: Sensors still can't locate the Borg ship. I'm trying to filter
out the interference. 
BARNABY: We'll be within transporter range in nineteen seconds. 
TAITT: I'm starting to get sensor resolution. There's the ship. 
CRUSHER: We'll enter orbit here. 
BARNABY: Helm, new course, heading zero five two mark seven. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
BARNABY: Stand by to drop out of warp in eight seconds. 
TAITT: Once we're in orbit, we should have about forty five seconds
before they intercept us. 
CRUSHER: Let's hope it's enough time. 
BARNABY: Emergency deceleration in five seconds. 
CRUSHER: Hold on. 
(whoomph) 
CRUSHER: Report. 
TAITT: We're in standard orbit, sir. The Borg ship is on the planet's
far side, and is moving to intercept. 
CRUSHER: Bridge to Transporter rooms. Begin evacuations. 
BARNABY: The Borg will be in weapons range in thirty two seconds. We
still can't locate Captain Picard's team and there's no sign of
Commander Riker or Lieutenant Worf. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Salazar. Report. 
SALAZAR [OC]: We're pulling the last teams off right now. 
[Transporter room]

SALAZAR: But there are six people still unaccounted
for. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Keep trying. 
[Bridge]

BARNABY: The Borg ship is powering up its weapons
array. 
CRUSHER: Come on, Chief. It's now or never. 
TAITT: They're preparing to fire. 
CRUSHER: Raise shields. 
BARNABY: The port nacelle's been hit. 
CRUSHER: Helm, get us out of here. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
BARNABY: We've lost warp engines. 
CRUSHER: Evasive manoeuvres, full impulse. 
(they sail past the massive Borg vessel) 
TAITT: Shields down to eighty percent. 
CRUSHER: Fire phasers. 
BARNABY: Direct hit. No damage to the Borg ship. 
TAITT: Shields down to seventy three percent. 
CRUSHER: What's the status of the warp engines? 
BARNABY: Still down. We can't outrun them. 
CRUSHER: Helm, set a new course, heading three four four mark six. Full
impulse. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Sir, that heading takes us directly into the sun. 
CRUSHER: The databanks should contain information about a process
called metaphasic shielding. 
BARNABY: I know about that research. Commander La Forge was developing
a programme
that would implement metaphasic properties. 
CRUSHER: Right. How far along was he? 
BARNABY: It's in the databanks but it's never been tested. 
CRUSHER: If we had metaphasic shielding, we could enter the sun's
corona but the Borg ship wouldn't be able to follow. Can you bring the
programme online? 
BARNABY: I can, but we have no way of knowing if the shields will hold.

TAITT: Sir, hull temperature is rising. Now at twelve thousand degrees
C. Radiation level nearing ten thousand rads. 
(weapons hit) 
CRUSHER: Report. 
TAITT: Shields at sixty two percent. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, activate the metaphasic programme. It's our best
shot. 
BARNABY: Aye, sir. 
TAITT: Hull temperature is critical. We can't withstand this heat much
longer. 
BARNABY: Programme is online. Engaging metaphasic shield now. 
TAITT: Hull temperature dropping. Down to seven thousand degrees. 
CRUSHER: Maintain course. 
BARNABY: The Borg ship has broken off pursuit. 
CRUSHER: All stop. 
TAITT: Sir, the Borg ship is taking up position relative to ours.
They're going to wait for us to come out. 
CRUSHER: The question is, how long can we survive in here?

[Holding cell]

PICARD: Well, I've done everything that Geordi
said. Now to activate it. 
TROI: How are we going to know whether the pulse reboots Data's ethical
programme? 
PICARD: We'll only tell that when we see his behaviour. 
TROI: Won't he realise something's happened to him? 
PICARD: No, it's one programme among thousands. I just hope this force
field has enough energy to trigger the pulse. 
(he slides the tiny device forward, and the blue is sucked into it) 
[Lore's lab]

LAFORGE: You know, Data, I've been thinking about
some of the times we've had. Like that time we went sailing on Devala
Lake. You remember that? 
DATA: I have a complete memory record of that day. 
LAFORGE: You decided to go swimming, and when you jumped out of the
boat you sank straight to the bottom. 
DATA: I did not have enough buoyancy to get back to the surface. 
LAFORGE: You had to walk over a kilometre along the bottom to get back
to shore. 
DATA: One kilometre forty six metres. 
LAFORGE: It took almost two weeks to get the water out of your servos. 
DATA: I am ready to irradiate your existing brain cells. 
LAFORGE: Data, if you ever go back to the way you were, you might not
be able to forgive yourself for what you're about to do. 
DATA: I am getting some anomalous readings from your neural net. I will
need to do further testing before I proceed. Someone will come and take
you back to your cell.

[Borg compound, outside]

LORE: There you are, brother. Have you made any
progress with La Forge? 
DATA: It is too early to tell if the nano-cortical fibres performed
their function. 
LORE: I suspect none of the humans will survive the process but then,
it's their own fault, isn't it? They should never have come here. What
were they thinking? 
DATA: They came looking for me. 
LORE: Humans are so sentimental. 
DATA: I betrayed them. If they die, I am responsible. 
LORE: Why are you talking like that? Is something wrong with your
programming? Maybe I should check your systems. 
DATA: I do not want you to check my systems. I must resolve these
issues myself. 
LORE: I think I've made a mistake. I don't believe you can tolerate the
amount of emotion I've given you. Perhaps I should cut back a little. 
(he pulls back a fingernail) 
LORE: How's that? 
DATA: I do not like it. 
LORE: Then you prefer having more emotions? 
DATA: Yes. 
LORE: They give you pleasure. 
DATA: Yes. Please, I want more. 
LORE: All right, a little more. For now. Aren't you going to thank me? 
DATA: Thank you. 
LORE: Don't mention it. I just hope this helps to clarify things for
you. 
(Data leaves) 
LORE: I am concerned about my brother, Crosis. I don't believe he
really wants to be a part of our great future.
