WESLEY COMPUTER DATA LAFORGE

[Bridge]

WESLEY: I'm getting an indication of possible
trouble in main Engineering, sir. 
[Observation lounge]

DATA: Can you be more specific? 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: I'm afraid not. I'm reading a problem with
the magnetic containment field which contains the antimatter. Could you
come up here? 
[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: We'll go to Engineering since that's where
the trouble is. Wes, don't disturb the Captain or Commander Riker until
we check this out. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Bridge, this is main Engineering. 
WESLEY [OC]: This is the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Are you running any test programs up there? 
WESLEY [OC]: No. 
LAFORGE: Are the Bynars? 
WESLEY [OC]: Not to my knowledge. Is there a problem? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. There's no one on duty here, and we're getting
some very strange readings from the magnetic containment field. 
DATA: The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I am
initiating Red Alert. 
LAFORGE: Data, I can't maintain the integrity of the containment field.

DATA: Engineering to Captain. (no reply) If the antimatter is released,
the ship will be destroyed. 
LAFORGE: Nothing I do has any effect. I'm losing it. Data, I've
rechecked every circuit. This is not a misread by the computer. 
DATA: Computer, situation analysis. 
COMPUTER: (male voice) Estimate release of antimatter in four minutes
eighteen seconds. Seventeen seconds. Sixteen seconds. 
DATA: Engineering to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: This is the bridge.
