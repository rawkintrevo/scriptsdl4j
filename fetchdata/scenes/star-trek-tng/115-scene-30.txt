[Guest quarters]

TASHA: Set phasers to stun.

[Bridge]

(Worf sneezes) 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Status report. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir. Doctor
Crusher's converted the holodeck into an isolation ward. 
PICARD: And the away team? 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Well, no recent contact, sir, but I have
informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing Romulan
threat to our Neutral Zone outpost. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge until
Commander Riker returns.
