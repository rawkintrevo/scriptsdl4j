[Bridge]

(the weapons fire definitely hits the starboard
nacelle) 
WORF: Direct hit to the port nacelle. Only minimal damage. Hit to the
starboard nacelle. Still, no appreciable damage. 
TROI: Will must've done something to their weapons. 
DATA: I believe you are right, Counsellor. It is now up to us to play
along. Release inertial dampers and cut power to decks thirty one
through thirty seven. 
GIUSTI: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Set phasers to twenty five percent. Return fire. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Mercenary Bridge]

BARAN: Continue firing! 
PICARD: I've lost three plasma relays on the disruptors. Auxiliary
power is, is not available. 
BARAN: Transfer weapons control to my station. There's a way to bypass
the relays and feed power 
(another hit) 
NARIK: The antimatter containment units are starting to buckle! 
TALLERA: The Enterprise has been badly damaged but they still have
superior firepower. If we remain here, we will be destroyed. The
logical course of action is to withdraw. 
BARAN: We've done enough damage. Narik, set course one eight zero, mark
two one five. Warp six. Initiate.
