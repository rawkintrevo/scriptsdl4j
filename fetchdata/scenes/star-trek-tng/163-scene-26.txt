RIKER TASHA PICARD GUINAN CASTILLO DATA

[1701C Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: Captain Garrett. 
TASHA [OC]: This is Lieutenant Yar, sir. Captain Garrett is dead.

[War room]

CASTILLO: I'm prepared to lead the Enterprise back
myself, Captain Picard. 
RIKER: Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last surviving senior officer.
He will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff in
Engineering. 
CASTILLO: I have good people willing to do their best. 
RIKER: Certainly, history never meant for this ship to go into battle
without her captain. 
CASTILLO: I can't speak to that point, sir, but I can get us back to
where we're supposed to be. I believe that's what Captain Garrett would
want me to do. 
DATA [OC]: Commander Data to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
DATA [OC]: Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the time
rift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. 
PICARD: Any signs of other Klingon vessels? 
DATA [OC]: No, sir. 
TASHA: Our coordinates have been transmitted to the Klingon command,
sir. We mustn't remain here. 
CASTILLO: Sir, it is my intention to return, unless you order me not
to. 
PICARD: How soon can your ship be ready? 
CASTILLO: We sustained moderate damage in the attack. I think we can
get underway in a few hours. 
PICARD: Make it so. We'll give you cover. 
[Transporter room]

CASTILLO: One to beam to the Enterprise-C. We keep
saying goodbye, don't we? 
TASHA: I wish there was more time. 
CASTILLO: More time. I think we have all the time we can handle as it
is. 
(They have a passionate kiss) 
CASTILLO: Lieutenant.

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: Can I get you something, Tasha? 
TASHA: Guinan, I have to know something. What happens to me in the
other time line? 
GUINAN: I don't have alternate biographies of the crew. As I said to
the captain, it's just a feeling. 
TASHA: But there's something more when you look at me, isn't there? I
can see it in your eyes, Guinan. We've known each other too long. 
GUINAN: We weren't meant to know each other at all. At least, that's
what I sense when I look at you. Tasha, you're not supposed to be here.

TASHA: Where am I supposed to be? 
GUINAN: Dead. 
TASHA: Do you know how? 
GUINAN: No. But I do know it was an empty death. A death without
purpose.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. Yes, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Captain, I request a transfer to the Enterprise-C. 
PICARD: For what reason? 
TASHA: They need someone at Tactical. 
PICARD: We need you here. 
TASHA: I'm not supposed to be here, sir. 
PICARD: Sit down, Lieutenant. What did she say to you? 
TASHA: I don't belong here, sir. I'm supposed to be dead. 
PICARD: She felt it necessary to reveal that to you? 
TASHA: I felt it was necessary. 
PICARD: I see. You realise that it is very possible the Enterprise-C
will fail. We will continue in this time line in which case your life,
hopefully, will continue for a long while. 
TASHA: I know how important it is that they don't fail, Captain. That's
why I'm requesting this transfer. 
PICARD: You don't belong on that ship, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: No, Captain Garrett belongs on that ship. But she's dead. And I
think there's a certain logic in this request. 
PICARD: There's no logic in this at all. Whether they succeed or not,
the Enterprise-C will be destroyed. 
TASHA: But Captain, at least with someone at Tactical, they will have a
chance to defend themselves well. It may be a matter of seconds or
minutes, but those could be the minutes that change history. Guinan
says I died a senseless death in the other time line. I didn't like the
sound of that, Captain. I've always known the risks that come with a
Starfleet uniform. If I'm to die in one, I'd like my death to count for
something. 
PICARD: Lieutenant. Permission granted. 
TASHA: Thank you, sir.
