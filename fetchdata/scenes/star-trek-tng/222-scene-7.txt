breakdown did registered felt say going let speed care

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: So what are we going to name this nebula?
FGC forty seven just doesn't have the proper ring to it. 
SUTTER: Why don't we call it Sutter's Cloud? 
DATA: The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five
seconds. 
LAFORGE: That's a bit on the long side. Sutter, let's see if you can
get a reading on the particle flux. 
SUTTER: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: I was thinking about something more along the lines of the La
Forge Nebula. It's got sort of a majestic sound, don't you think? 
DATA: Given the selections, I prefer FGC four seven. 
(the ship shakes) 
SUTTER: What was that? 
LAFORGE: It felt like we hit something. 
DATA: Shields have registered an impact, however sensors show nothing
in the vicinity.

[Bridge]

WORF: Forward velocity is down by point two
percent, and dropping. 
PICARD: Engineering. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Report. 
LAFORGE: Could be something wrong with the shields, Captain. We're
checking it out now. 
SUTTER: Systems are normal, sir. 
LAFORGE: So did we hit something or not? Shields say yes, sensors say
no. This is very strange. Ensign, give me a breakdown on shield energy
conversion and then run a spectral. (nearly steps on Clara) Whoa. Where
did you come from? 
CLARA: I'm Clara Sutter. That's my daddy. 
SUTTER: Clara, you can't be here right now. 
CLARA: But Isabella wanted to see Engineering. 
SUTTER: I don't care what Isabella wanted to see, you go back to our
quarters right now. 
CLARA: But Daddy 
PICARD [OC]: Bridge to La Forge. Our speed is still dropping. 
LAFORGE: I hear you, Captain. I'm increasing the power to the impulse
engines, but forward velocity just isn't consistent with engine output.

PICARD [OC]: Explanation. 
LAFORGE: It seems like there's something increasing the drag
coefficient on the ship.
