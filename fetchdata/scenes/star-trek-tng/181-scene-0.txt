K'EHLEYR [on viewscreen]: It's good to see you again, Captain.
Lieutenant Worf. 
PICARD: How may we be of assistance, Ambassador?

PICARD: Lieutenant, please receive our guest. 
WORF: Captain, I must request permission to send another officer. 
PICARD: May I know your reason? 
WORF: My dishonour among Klingons may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, you are a member of this crew, and you will not go
into hiding whenever a Klingon ship uncloaks. 
WORF: I withdraw my request, sir.
