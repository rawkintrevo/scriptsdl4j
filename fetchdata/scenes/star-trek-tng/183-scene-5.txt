[Moon's surface]

(They've fashioned headdresses for themselves, and
Wesley is working in the shadow of the shuttle) 
PICARD: Any luck with the tricorder, Ensign? 
WESLEY: I think so, sir. The scanning range may be a bit limited, but
it's better than nothing. 
GUEST1: These were on board, Captain. They're working. 
(weapons, on makeshift belts) 
PICARD: Excellent. Our communicators may not be able to get a signal
through this strong a magnetic field. I'm fashioning an arrow. If a
search party finds the wreckage, they'll know we've headed for those
mountains. 
(using brittle debris to make the pointer on the sand) 
GUEST1: Are you crazy? They're too far away. We'll never make it. 
PICARD: We can't survive in this sun. Where there's mountains, there's
shelter. 
GUEST1: You've got no right to make the decisions. I'm the captain of
this ship. 
WESLEY: If you want to get out of this, I suggest you listen to Captain
Picard. He's the one who's going to keep us alive. 
PICARD: Thank you, Ensign, that's enough. Captain Dirgo, you're an able
pilot. I welcome your input. Do you feel that there is an alternative
we're overlooking? 
GUEST1: No. 
PICARD: Very well. I suggest a steady pace, not a brisk one. We need to
ration our energy. Try breathing through your nose. That way it will
help to prevent dehydration. I'll lead. Captain Dirgo, will you bring
up the rear? 
(Dirgo says farewell to his ship, picks up the medical bag and off they
trudge) 
(Dirgo is the first one to stumble in the heat) 
WESLEY: And you were worried about how tough the Captain is? 
(Wesley walks off, and Dirgo takes a swig from a concealed bottle) 
(the mountains are a lot closer now) 
GUEST1: Did you find water? 
WESLEY: No, not yet. 
GUEST1: What are you doing with that? 
PICARD: Mister Crusher? 
WESLEY: I'm not sure, sir. It's an energy reading. 
PICARD: Energy reading? What kind? 
WESLEY: Low frequency EM. It's been getting stronger the closer we get
to those mountains. 
GUEST1: What are you saying? Is something over there, waiting for us? 
WESLEY: I'm not sure what it is. It just keeps registers as a repeating
energy pattern. 
PICARD: Ensign, are you suggesting this energy is not naturally
occurring? 
WESLEY: The readings could be indicative of some electromagnetic
properties in the rocks, but I don't think so. 
PICARD: A life form? 
WESLEY: It's possible. The pattern is fairly organised. 
PICARD: Well, we can't go back and we can't stay here. We've got to
keep going for the mountains. No matter what is waiting there.
