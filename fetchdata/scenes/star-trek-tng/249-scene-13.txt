PICARD: So Gowron has come on board in order to
test your claim. 
KOROTH: Gowron knows that his days are nearly over. Now he comes
crawling aboard with some kind of test. 
TORIN: We do not have to prove anything to Gowron. 
KAHLESS: What is this test? 
PICARD: He has brought a knife with him, a knife is was supposed to be
stained with the blood of Kahless. 
TORIN: Gowron has brought the Knife of Kirom? No one is permitted to
remove it from the sacred vault. 
KOROTH: Gowron does not care about what is sacred. 
PICARD: He wants to run a genetic analysis on a sample of the blood and
on you. That should tell us if there is a biological match. Now if you
agree to the test, I will make the Enterprise facilities available to
ensure that it is conducted impartially. 
KAHLESS: (looking at Worf) Perhaps it is time to settle the doubts of
those who still do not believe. I will allow this test.

(Crusher scans the bloodied dagger) 
CRUSHER: There, that should do it. Computer, run a genetic comparison
on this blood sample and the tissue belonging to Kahless. 
COMPUTER: The genetic patterns are identical. 
GOWRON: But how? How can this be? 
WORF: It is true. Kahless has returned.
