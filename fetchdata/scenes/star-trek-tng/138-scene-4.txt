[Observation lounge]

DATA: Analysis bears out that the object was
definitely terrestrial in origin, dated mid twenty first century. 
PICARD: No, no. No Earth ship of that time could have travelled out
this far. 
DATA: Nevertheless, that is what our tests indicate. And the markings
we discovered are consistent with this hypothesis. 
TROI: Any indication of what destroyed it, Data? 
DATA: That is even more significant than the object itself, Counsellor.
On several of its surfaces, the molecules seem to have disintegrated 
RIKER: Disintegrated? How? 
DATA: Almost as if they were hit by a weapon from our time. 
PICARD: Curiouser and curiouser. 
(Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland, if you needed reminding.) 
WESLEY [OC]: Captain, we've detected a large structure on the planet.

[Bridge]

WESLEY: It's a building of some sort, situated on a
plain of frozen methane, smack in the middle of a tremendous storm
belt. 
RIKER: I don't believe this. That structure is surrounded by breathable
air. 
PICARD: Is there any connection between that structure and the ship
fragment we found? 
LAFORGE: Unknown, sir. 
PICARD: Suggestions? 
RIKER: Just one, sir. We could go down there and have a look. 
PICARD: Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I think
we could risk a minimal away team, Number One.
