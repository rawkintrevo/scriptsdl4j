LAFORGE: The power needs to be rerouted through
this venturi chamber before it can be channelled to the engine's coils.

REGINOD: It is broken. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but not for long. See, we are going to reconfigure these
separators, here and over here. 
RIKER [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker. Come in. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. Go ahead.

RIKER: Are you all right? 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Sure. Why do you ask? 
RIKER: Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence from
the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: I don't think there's anything to worry about.

RIKER: Understood. As soon as you complete the repairs, I want you back
here. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir, I should be done here momentarily.

LAFORGE: You see? Like that. (Geordi puts the
circuit boards back) There. Your guidance is now up and running. 
(Then the lights go out) 
LAFORGE: Main power failure? 
GREBNEDLOG: Will our ship go now? 
LAFORGE: Your guidance is operational, but you're not going anywhere,
not with a main power failure. 
GREBNEDLOG: It is broken. 
REGINOD: Can you make it go? 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker?
