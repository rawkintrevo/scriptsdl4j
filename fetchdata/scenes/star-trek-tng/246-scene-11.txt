RIKER WORF PICARD COMPUTER CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: We are about to enter the Indri system, sir. 
RIKER: Riker to Picard. We are approaching Indri Eight. 
PICARD [OC]: On my way. 
DATA: Sensors are picking up severe atmospheric fluctuations on the
planet. 
RIKER: Assume a high orbit. 
PICARD: On screen, Mister Worf. 
(a pretty blue green planet is turning a nasty orange-brown) 
WORF: Some kind of plasma reaction is consuming the lower atmosphere. 
PICARD: Can we stop it? 
WORF: No, sir. The reaction is global. 
DATA: All life on the planet is being destroyed, sir. 
RIKER: Why would anyone want to destroy all the life on an uninhabited,
neutral planet with no strategic importance whatsoever? 
PICARD: All the life. Perhaps the Professor's number blocks had
something to do with organic matter. 
DATA: If we narrow the search parameters to the biological database, it
might increase the chances of the computer finding a match. 
PICARD: I'll be in the lab.

[Laboratory]

COMPUTER: Pattern match found. 
CRUSHER: Specify. 
COMPUTER: The number blocks are mathematical representations of
fragments of deoxyribonucleic acid strands. 
PICARD: DNA fragments? 
CRUSHER: Each from a different lifeform from nineteen different worlds.

PICARD: The planets that these fragments are from are scattered across
the quadrant. No wonder it took the Professor so long to collect them.
But why? 
CRUSHER: Wait a minute. These fragments all seem to have similar
protein configurations. They may be chemically compatible. 
PICARD: But how can that be possible? They're different species from
different planets. There should be no compatibility at all. 
CRUSHER: I know, but look at the base pair combinations, they're
uniform. If I'm right. Computer, connect the DNA fragments according to
protein link compatibility. 
PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: I have no idea.
