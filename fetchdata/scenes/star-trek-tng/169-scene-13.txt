GUINAN: Yes, I know him comes in. He stands at the
bar. He doesn't say much. He orders a warm milk. 
LAFORGE: Figures. 
GUINAN: Warm milk helps you sleep, La Forge. You should try it. What's
this have to do with Barclay? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I'm just trying to figure the man out. Do you
ever talk to him? 
GUINAN: He doesn't talk much. 
LAFORGE: Does he have any friends? 
GUINAN: Not that I've seen. 
LAFORGE: What do you do with a guy like that? 
GUINAN: Well, I just serve him warm milk and let him be. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky. I can't let him be. He's my
problem. 
GUINAN: Well, he's imaginative. 
LAFORGE: How do you know that? 
GUINAN: I know. 
LAFORGE: Well, then maybe he's in the wrong line of work. 
GUINAN: You engineering types don't appreciate imagination? 
LAFORGE: That's not it, Guinan. He just doesn't fit in here. 
GUINAN: Terkim. 
LAFORGE: What? 
GUINAN: Reminds me of Terkim. My mother's brother. Sort of the family
misfit. Everybody told me to stay away from him. Bad influence. 
LAFORGE: Did you? 
GUINAN: Are you kidding? He was the only member of the family who had a
sense of humour. Except no one ever stayed around him long enough to
realize it but me. My mother tells me I remind her of him, and I
probably do. The idea of fitting in just repels me. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I'm not make myself clear, Guinan. Barclay, well, he's
always late. The man's nervous. Nobody wants to be around this guy. 
GUINAN: If I felt that nobody wanted to be around me, I'd probably be
late and nervous too. 
LAFORGE: Guinan, that's not the point. 
GUINAN: Are you sure? Excuse me. 
LAFORGE: Computer, where is Lieutenant Barclay?

[Holodeck - Glade]

LAFORGE: Reg? 
(He comes upon a Gainsborough tableau - Beverly on a floral swing and
Wesley in blue, eating cake. There's a white parakeet in a cane cage
too) 
LAFORGE: Beverly? 
CRUSHER: Good morning, my lord. Manners, my son. Manners. You embarrass
me before our guest. Master Barclay will spank you if you misbehave. 
LAFORGE: Wesley ? 
WESLEY: What do you want? 
LAFORGE: Well, I guess I want Master Barclay. 
CRUSHER: The boys got into another little scrap, I'm afraid. But boys
will be boys. 
(A swordfight enters, with much clashing of swords. three musketeers
versus Barclay) 
LAFORGE: You cannot withstand our assault forever, Barclay. 
DATA: You are outnumbered, Mister Barclay. Say you will yield and it
ends here. 
BARCLAY: I will speak with my sword, sir. 
PICARD: In God's name, where did you learn to fight like this, man? 
BARCLAY: Self taught, my capitaine. Shall I give you a few lessons? 
(Naturally, Barclay is completely victorious) 
PICARD: Who is that? One of your allies? 
BARCLAY: Jean-Luc. Not that old trick. I'm very disappointed in you. 
(Geordi coughs, Reg turns, and the bottom falls out of his world)

BARCLAY: I'll make it easy for you, Commander. I'll
request reassignment. 
LAFORGE: Now, wait a minute. 
BARCLAY: Look, we both know, the whole ship knows, I just can't cut it
here. 
LAFORGE: Hey, Barclay, I've spent a few hours on the holodeck too, you
know. Now, as far as I'm concerned what you do in the holodeck is your
own business, as long as it doesn't interfere with your work. 
BARCLAY: You're, you're not going to tell anyone about this? 
LAFORGE: I don't think everybody would appreciate your imagination like
I do. It is kind of unusual, recreating people you already know. 
BARCLAY: well, it was just. I needed to blow off some steam because
one, one of the officers had been getting on my back. 
LAFORGE: Let me guess. 
BARCLAY: It was you, and I just couldn't tell you what I wanted to tell
you to your face, so it just sort of got out of control. 
LAFORGE: I don't know. There's a part of this that's kind of
therapeutic. Maybe you ought to talk to Counsellor Troi about it. 
BARCLAY: It's, it's, I, when I'm in there I'm just more comfortable.
You don't know what a struggle this has been for me, Commander. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to help, if I can. 
BARCLAY: Being afraid all the time, of forgetting somebody's name, not
knowing what to do with your hands. I mean, I'm the guy who writes down
things to remember to say when there's a party. And then when he
finally get there, he winds up alone in the corner trying to look
comfortable examining a potted plant. 
LAFORGE: You're just shy, Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Just shy. Sounds like nothing serious, doesn't it? You can't
know. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Go ahead.
