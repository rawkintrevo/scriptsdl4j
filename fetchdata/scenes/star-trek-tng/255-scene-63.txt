LAFORGE: It must have read my thoughts through the
probe interface and took the form of my mother to try to talk me into
taking the ship closer to the surface. 
PICARD [OC]: Are these beings

[Laboratory]

PICARD: Responsible for the death of the Raman's
crew? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but I don't think it was on purpose. They probably tried
communicating with them the same way they're communicating with me, by
directly accessing their thoughts. It must've been fatal to the crew. I
guess the interface is what protected me.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I have to take them back, Captain. They
can't survive so far up in the atmosphere. I'll turn the ship around
and come back as soon as I'm 
(rumble, bang, flash) 
[Laboratory]

PICARD: Geordi, what's happening? 
LAFORGE: The atmosphere is getting more turbulent. It's overloading the
systems. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I'm having difficulty keeping the shields
up. 
SILVA: Geordi. We're safe now. Goodbye. 
(she turns into flame and goes through the bulkhead. BANG!) 
LAFORGE: I'm losing power. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: Total shield failure in eight seconds. 
PICARD: Can we switch the input? 
CRUSHER: Almost.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: Shields are failing! 
(and the ship is falling apart)
