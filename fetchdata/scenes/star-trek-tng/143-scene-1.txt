RIKER: This just came in for you from Starfleet 
(Tosses Wesley a data module) 
WESLEY: Testing parameters?
DATA: Do not be apprehensive. Wes. I found the Academy examinations
quite elementary.
WESLEY: You would.
RIKER: Your earlier test results were good enough to get you Academy
credit for your work here. I don't think you have anything to worry
about. 
WESLEY: Those Academy cadets can be extremely competitive. 
RIKER: But you have the practical experience, Wes. 
DATA: Commander Riker is correct. While the information imparted to
cadets at the Academy is unquestionably vital for prospective Starfleet
officers, it nevertheless requires a significant period of
supplementary systems training and situational disciplines. 
RIKER: Didn't I just say that? 
DATA: Yes, sir, but not quite as perspicuously.

PICARD: I will not have you telling me what course

Starbase Five One Five immediately. 
PICARD: Oh, please. I feel fine. 
PULASKI: The truth is, you've ignored this far too long. 
PICARD: This ship has a mission to carry out. 
PULASKI: An astronomical survey to be conducted by the science
officers, I believe. 
PICARD: And I 'was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster
for myself. 
PULASKI: Then we'll perform the procedure right here. 
PICARD: Absolutely not. 
PULASKI: My staff and I are fully capable of giving you the
replacement. 
PICARD: That's not the point. It would be (deep breath) It would be
inappropriate for you to carry out the procedure. 
PULASKI: Captain Picard, I had no idea. You do have an ego, don't you? 
PICARD: Meaning? 
PULASKI: You're concerned about your image. Don't worry. If you get
yourself down to Starbase Five One Five, your image will be safe with
me.
