[Corridor]

TOMALAK: As soon as we arrive at your Outpost
twenty three, the final negotiations should go quickly. 
PICARD: I agree, Ambassador. All of the difficult issues have been
resolved. 
TOMALAK: After much debate. Your Captain Riker is the kind of
negotiator even the Ferengi should avoid. 
PICARD: But we have come to an agreement both sides are happy with,
largely thanks to Captain Riker. 
TOMALAK: And we are grateful, Captain. The new alliance will greatly
benefit my people. 
RIKER: As I hope it will benefit mine. 
TOMALAK: It will, Captain. It will.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Main Bridge. 
TOMALAK: The virus you contracted, Captain. Have you fully recovered? 
PICARD: I assure you Captain Riker is quite well. He's looking forward
to attending the final negotiations as planned. 
TOMALAK: Excellent. The signing of this treaty is an historic occasion.
You, of all people, deserve to be there. 
RIKER: Thank you, Ambassador.

[Bridge]

TOMALAK: So this is the Bridge of the Enterprise.
And this, I assume, is your Tactical position. Impressive. 
RIKER: Excuse me. Admiral, Deanna, I need a moment with you. Commander
Data, if you would accompany the Ambassador on his tour. 
DATA: Certainly, sir. 
RIKER: Excuse us, Ambassador. 
DATA: Ambassador, you may find this of interest. These newly refined
sensors are capable of pinpointing the power emissions of a cloaked
warbird even at warp.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Are you saying you trust Tomalak? 
PICARD: I trust the process we have built with the Romulans over the
past four years. They have nothing to gain by betrayal. 
RIKER: Are you sure? You've always said it's a chess game with the
Romulans. Move, counter move, guile and deceit.
TROI: I sense no such dishonesty in Tomalak. His desire for peace is
sincere. He wants this alliance. There is no cause for concern. 
RIKER: No cause for concern? We're talking about revealing the location
of Outpost twenty three, the key to all of our defences in the Neutral
Zone. 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Will, your information is out of date. The strategic
importance of Outpost twenty three is minimal. Has been for years. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher to Riker. Are you there, Captain? 
RIKER: What is it, Doctor? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Your son has been injured. He's been taken to Sickbay.
You'd better come down here right away.

[Sickbay]

(Young Jean-Luc is having his arm treated) 
JEAN-LUC: Dad. 
RIKER: Are you alright? 
JEAN-LUC: I'm fine. 
RIKER: What happened? 
CRUSHER: It's broken, but it's going to be all right in just a minute.
Now, let's go easy on this arm for a little while, okay? 
RIKER: How'd this happen? 
JEAN-LUC: I was in the gym playing parrises squares. 
RIKER: Parrises squares? 
JEAN-LUC: I fell off the ramp. 
RIKER: At your age? You could break your neck! 
JEAN-LUC: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. 
CRUSHER: Continue the compression attenuator for two more minutes. 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Can I talk to you for a moment? 
RIKER: I'll be right back. 
(they walk away) 
CRUSHER: Will, how old were you when you first started playing parrises
squares? 
RIKER: Alright, I was probably a little younger than he is. It's just
that, for all practical purposes, this is my first day as a father and
he almost kills himself. 
CRUSHER: He didn't almost kill himself. He just broke a wrist, just
like a lot of other boys his age when they fall. 
RIKER: You're right. It's difficult. 
CRUSHER: Difficult for you? What about for Jean-Luc? Can you imagine
how he feels? You've lost sixteen years. Jean-Luc has lost a lot more
than that. First his mother and now his father. 
OGAWA: Good as new, Captain. You can take him home. 
RIKER: Thanks. How's the arm? 
JEAN LUC: It's fine. Dad, I'm really sorry. I mean, I know you've got
more important things to do. 
RIKER: There is nothing more important than this, son.

[Turbolift]

JEAN-LUC: Deck eight. 
RIKER: Halt. I know how hard this is for you. 
JEAN-LUC: It's okay, Dad. 
RIKER: No, okay's not good enough. When I was your age, my own father
he wasn't there for me. And I really needed him. I've often wondered
what kind of father I'd be. I never felt quite ready. The idea even
scared me a little. 
JEAN-LUC: Scared? You? 
RIKER: Yeah. But I guess I got over it. You're here. Resume. It's
important to me that I don't let you down, Jean-Luc. 
JEAN-LUC: You never have, Dad. You've always been there for me. 
RIKER: I'll have to take your word for that because I don't remember
any of it. Your first step, your first tooth, nothing. And I want to
remember. I guess there's only one thing we can do. We've got to build
some new memories. 
[Corridor]

RIKER: I'm not sure it's still in the memory banks,
but I used to have a great fishing
programme on the holodeck. 
JEAN-LUC: The Curtis Creek programme? 
RIKER: You know it? 
JEAN-LUC: Sure. We've gone to Curtis Creek lots of times. 
RIKER: Would you like to go again? 
JEAN-LUC: You bet. 
RIKER: Well as soon as these negotiations are out of the way, you and I
are going fishing. 
JEAN-LUC: Great!

[Riker's quarters]

JEAN-LUC: And then Mom tried to net the fish, and
she fell in the creek, too. And then you tried to pull us both out, and
you fell in. 
RIKER: I'm not sure I want to remember that. 
JEAN-LUC: Mom really liked Curtis Creek. We went there for picnics and
stuff lots of times. 
RIKER: What was she like? 
JEAN-LUC: She was great. I think of her a lot. I'd better go change. 
RIKER: Computer. Display family record. Riker. William T. Limit to
visual. 
(the wall monitor shows a movie of Riker and young J-L having fun) 
RIKER: Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. 
COMPUTER: Please restate request. 
RIKER: Damn. 
JEAN-LUC: What's wrong, Dad? 
RIKER: The computer still isn't working properly. I can't get a visual
of your mother. 
JEAN-LUC: But I know Mom's pictures are there. Did you give a stardate?
Computer. Display family record. Riker, Mrs. William T. Home file.
Stardate 58416. 
(a movie of J-L's 7th birthday, and the woman is a brunette last seen
in a season one episode...) 
RIKER: Min! Minuet. 
JEAN-LUC: Mom was beautiful, wasn't she? 
RIKER: Yes. 
JEAN-LUC: What's wrong, Dad? 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Riker. 
RIKER: Riker here. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, please come to the Bridge. 
RIKER: On my way.
