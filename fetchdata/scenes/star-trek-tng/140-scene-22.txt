[Corridor]

KYLE: I'm leaving at twenty one hundred hours. Can
I have a minute?

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: I've practised my best Academy courtesy, now
it's time for you to go. 
KYLE: It's time for us to have a talk, so lower your shields. 
RIKER: I'm asking you to leave, or I'll 
KYLE: You'll what? You know, it's a shame there's no anbo-jyutsu ring
nearby. 
RIKER: Really? There is. Deck Twelve. The gymnasium. 
KYLE: We can clear the air once and for all. 
RIKER: You're on.

[Doctor's office]

KYLE: Scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me. 
PULASKI: That's right. I thought I knew you, Kyle. 
KYLE: You do, as well as anyone. 
PULASKI: Then what is this I hear about an anbo-jyutsu match with Will?

KYLE: You've heard. 
PULASKI: Haven't we grown beyond the point where we resolve our
problems with physical conflict? 
KYLE: I think you're overreacting. 
PULASKI: I'm overreacting? You're the one who's going out to fight with
his own son. 
KYLE: Don't think of it as a fight, Kate. Think of it as more of a
contest. 
PULASKI: And suppose one of you is injured? 
KYLE: I know where to find a good doctor. Kate 
PULASKI: Kyle. 
KYLE: Will and I have been playing anbo-jyutsu ever since he was eight
old, and he knows how to handle himself. And so do I. 
PULASKI: Don't take this personally, but Will is in his prime. 
KYLE: And I'm no spring chicken, I know. Don't worry. He's never been
able to beat me.
