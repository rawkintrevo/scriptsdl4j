PICARD DATA
pre calls crew identify systems ready offline readings stabilisers

[Shuttlecraft]

DATA: Captain, the ship is not at the pre-arranged
coordinates. 
PICARD: Have they been delayed? 
DATA: I do not know. I am unable to raise them on any communication
channel. 
PICARD: Scan the vicinity. See if you can find them. 
DATA: I found it, sir, two light years away. 
PICARD: Set a course. 
(whoosh) 
DATA: The Enterprise appears to be adrift. I am reading power
fluctuations on all decks. 
PICARD: Life signs? 
DATA: There are life signs. However, sensor readings are highly
distorted. I am unable to identify specific lifeforms. 
PICARD: Adjust the axial stabilisers to match the attitude and rotation
rate of the Enterprise, I'm going to dock the shuttle manually. 
[Shuttlebay]

DATA: Main power is offline. All systems are in
standby or emergency mode. There is no response from any manned
station. 
PICARD: Any sign of the crew? 
DATA: I cannot access internal sensors from here. We will have to go to
the Bridge. 
[Corridor]

(strange calls in the air) 
PICARD: That sounds like animals. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I am able to discern over three hundred different
vocalisations. 
(something large rattles along a Jefferies tube) 
PICARD: Look at this. 
(a shed skin) 
DATA: It is composed of reptilian DNA. I believe it is an epidermal
layer that has been cast off during moulting. 
PICARD: But it seems to be humanoid. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I cannot explain it. There are no species aboard the
Enterprise that shed their skin in this fashion. 
(a little further along there is a door covered in condensation) 
DATA: Sir. 
PICARD: These are Commander Troi's quarters. Can you tell if she's
inside? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Data, I want to have a look in here. Stand ready.
