[Engineering]

(A man jumps into the upper core area and kills an
engineer) 
LAFORGE: Security to Engineering. 
(Geordi just manages to avoid a hail of bullets) 
[Bridge]

WORF: Intruders in Engineering 
DATA: Casualties reported on deck twelve. Sickbay responding. 
PICARD: Seal off all decks. Lock on transporters to the intruder
signals. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Intruder signals unstable, Captain, I cannot lock on.

forcefields will contain them, sir.

jump out. Geordi has seen them) 
LAFORGE: Explosive charge on the main warp chamber. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room three, lock on the
explosive device and energise. 
CREWMAN [OC]: It's scrambling the sensors, Captain. I can't pinpoint
it. 
PICARD: Begin emergency evacuation. Stand by for saucer separation,
Mister La Forge, can you remove the charge from the engine core? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I'm trying. Hold on. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: They've got it locked on somehow. Stand
by. 
(He gets a laser tool and cuts it off the core) 
LAFORGE: Transporter room, lock on my signal and stand by to transport
two kilometres off the starboard nacelle.

TROI: His signal?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Transporter Room, now! 
(There's a bang in space)
