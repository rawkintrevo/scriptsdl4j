PICARD: Status report. 
WESLEY: We're attempting to employ alternate encoding schemes. 
LAFORGE: There could be hundreds of possible combinations. 
PICARD: Is there an intelligence causing this interference? 
LAFORGE: That's impossible to tell, Captain. 
PICARD: It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When he
lost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediately
to the beam down coordinates. 
TROI: I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose one
word to assess his mood, it would be amused. 
PICARD: Amused? 
[Casino]

(Good ol' Tex is settling himself at a blackjack
table, next to a blonde lady. Data goes up to the table) 
GUEST5: Put some chips there, mister. Yes, sirree! You're new around
here, aren't you? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
GUEST5: Sit down. I'm going to teach you how this game is played, boy.
Go ahead. Ante up. 
(Tex puts his Stetson on Data, and Data sits the other side of him) 
GUEST1: He wants you to cut the cards. 
DATA: Ah, is this poker? 
GUEST5: No, no, blackjack. 
DATA: Blackjack. Accessing. Ah. Also known as twenty one, a number
which defines the object of the game. Picture cards are worth ten, aces
one or eleven, all other cards face value. 
GUEST5: Boy, you're right. You are right. 
(Data does a one-handed cut of the pack, and Vanessa whistles at his
skill) 
GUEST5: Pretty smooth. Run 'em, boy. Make 'em nice and friendly. 
GUEST1: Twenty one, twenty one. 
GUEST5: Don't look at your hand, honey. That gal has got to win. Now,
honey, you got fifteen and the dealer's showing ten. 
GUEST1: Do I hit, Texas, or do I stand? 
GUEST5: If you've got to win, you've got to hit. 
GUEST1: Hit me. (a king) Damn! 
GUEST5: Shoot. Hit me. Twenty one, and a winner. Yes, sirree. 
DATA: Hit me. Another please. 
GUEST5: Do you think you've had about enough? 
DATA: If the objective of the game is to approach a total of twenty one
points, I will definitely need another card. 
GUEST1: Yeah. 
GUEST5: Boy, you have got the brass. Do you know what the odds are on a
five card charlie? Hell, you're just throwing your money away. 
DATA: Hit me. 
(Even with the final nine, the two twos and the two threes keep him
from going bust) 
GUEST5: How'd you? Shut my mouth. Hey, you're not one of them card
counting fellas, are you? 
DATA: The number of the cards and their values remain quite constant.
What would be the purpose in counting them? 
GUEST1: Yeah. 
RIKER: Having fun, Data? 
DATA: Fun, sir? While there is a certain amount of enjoyment involved,
I am mainly conducting research into 
RIKER: Save it. We're getting out of here. 
DATA: Understood, sir. 
GUEST5: Guys, you're holding up the game. 
RIKER: Our apologies, sir. 
GUEST5: I'll watch your chips. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. 
GUEST5: Hey. The hat. 
DATA: Sorry, sir. 
GUEST5: Deal them up.
