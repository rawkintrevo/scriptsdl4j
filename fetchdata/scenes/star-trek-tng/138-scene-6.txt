[Bridge]

WESLEY: It's a building of some sort, situated on a
plain of frozen methane, smack in the middle of a tremendous storm
belt. 
RIKER: I don't believe this. That structure is surrounded by breathable
air. 
PICARD: Is there any connection between that structure and the ship
fragment we found? 
LAFORGE: Unknown, sir. 
PICARD: Suggestions? 
RIKER: Just one, sir. We could go down there and have a look. 
PICARD: Breathable air. No life forms that might be dangerous. I think
we could risk a minimal away team, Number One. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker, Data and Worf are the away team) 
O'BRIEN: Give me a moment, gents. We're dealing with an extremely
narrow access point. 
RIKER: Phasers on stun. Ready when you are. 
O'BRIEN: I believe we've got it now. You have a green light, Commander.

RIKER: Energise.

[Planet surface]

(Nothing. Absolute void, except for..) 
DATA: Those ammonia storms are less than a kilometre away, yet they do
not appear to penetrate this breathable zone. 
RIKER: It's like the eye of a hurricane. 
WORF: Commander, what is that? 
(It is a revolving door, with art nouveau decoration. No building, just
the turning door and it's frame) 
RIKER: A door. 
DATA: The structure must be here, yet we cannot see it. 
RIKER: Enterprise, this is Commander Riker.
