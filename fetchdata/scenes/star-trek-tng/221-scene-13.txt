[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: We've been able to stabilise his
condition. If we're lucky he'll regain consciousness in a few days. Set
up level one cranio-sacral display. 
MEDIC [OC]: Yes, Doctor. 
PICARD: I'll advise the Valtese delegation that the conference will
have to be postponed. 
KAMALA: That won't be possible. My ability to imprint on a mate will
only last a matter of hours after the completion of the Finiis'ral. If
I hadn't been removed from stasis prematurely, a delay might have
been possible. But now, I will have to bond with Alrik within two days.

PICARD: But there are points in the negotiations that Briam still has
to address. 
KAMALA: You are familiar with the issues. 
PICARD: Familiar, yes, but I can't represent your peoples' interests. 
KAMALA: You can represent the interests of peace. My people will agree,
I'm certain of it. 
PICARD: But there are customs and rituals of which I have no experience
at all. 
KAMALA: I told you, I'm extremely knowledgeable about Valt. I will help
you prepare.

(Kamala is showing Picard how to play the
xylophone)
KAMALA: Torze qua. 
(he plays the chords and notes) 
KAMALA: That's right. 
PICARD: I'm reminded of piano lessons when I was a child. Preparing for
some dreaded recital. 
KAMALA: You still play? 
PICARD: No. I regret that I gave it up. It used to please my mother.
But I didn't like performing in front of an audience. 
KAMALA: Shy? 
PICARD: No. Just not very good. 
KAMALA: Thank you. For letting down your guard, if only for a moment. 
PICARD: You will have to help me in the pronunciation of this scroll. 
KAMALA: What is it about me you fear? 
PICARD: Kamala. 
KAMALA: Do you find me unattractive? 
PICARD: I find you unavailable. 
KAMALA: I'm being terribly selfish. I apologise. We have something in
common, Captain. When I was a child, I took music lessons, too. 
PICARD: Really? What instrument? 
KAMALA: All of them. 
PICARD: The entire orchestra? 
KAMALA: Plus a few Valtese horns that sound like braying Targhee
Moonbeasts. They are said to soothe the nerves of Valtese men. My
mother never even heard me play. I was taken from her when I was four
and sequestered in a royal village where I was prepared to fulfill my
destiny. 
PICARD: It sounds as if it were a very lonely time for you. 
KAMALA: On the contrary, I had servants and tutors at my side
constantly. You once asked me what I'm like when I'm alone. I've never
been. There was always somebody there to educate me in literature,
history, art, sex. But I have been alone on this journey, and I've
found myself thinking about all the curious questions you asked. You
wanted to know who I am. And as I continue to ask myself, the only
answer that comes to me is, I am for you, Alrik of Valt. Because that's
the truth. In a day, I will bond with a man I've never met. and I will
turn myself into what he wants me to be, for the rest of my life. 
PICARD: I also once asked you if you were doing this of your own
accord. 
KAMALA: I'm honoured to be chosen to serve my people as an emissary of
peace. But I find it ironic on the eve of this ceremony, which I have
spent my entire life preparing for, that I should meet a man like you. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: The Valtese ship has arrived. Chancellor Alrik is ready to
beam aboard.
