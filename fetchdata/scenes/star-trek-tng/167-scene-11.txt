[Cavern]

(a single entrance, almost circular with a nice
flat floor. There's the sound of running water) 
VASH: This is it. We've reached the end of our journey. 
PICARD: Do you have the exact location? 
VASH: Seven metres in from the opening along the wall. 
PICARD: That should make it about here. 
VASH: What the? 
PICARD: Something wrong? 
VASH: I can't get a reading on this. There must be starithium ore in
these rocks. 
PICARD: That leaves us but one alternative. 
(he gets out the spades) 
PICARD: Shall we? 
(They've barely started digging when the aliens beam in) 
VASH: Picard! 
PICARD: A little premature, aren't we? 
GUEST4: We are to be witness to a great moment, Picard. 
VASH: Who the hell are they? 
PICARD: They are security officers from the twenty seventh century.
They're here to take back the Uthat. 
VASH: You knew about this and didn't say anything? 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Vash. Would you have brought me here if I had told
you? 
VASH: Probably not. 
PICARD: My point exactly. 
GUEST3: So the betrayer is herself betrayed. You've put together quite a
little team. 
GUEST4: Do not interrupt the captain. 
PICARD: How did you get here? 
GUEST3: I found the disc in her room. 
VASH: That's impossible. I made a copy as a precaution, but I burned it
before we left. 
GUEST3: Only the outer casing was incinerated. Now, I had no intention
of interrupting you. Please, continue digging. 
(They've got about a metre down when Picard throws down his shovel) 
GUEST3: No one told you to stop digging, human. 
PICARD: I see no reason to continue. 
GUEST3: You will do as I say. 
PICARD: Look about you, Sovak. By now it must be obvious, even to you.
The Uthat is not here. 
GUEST3: Is this some pathetic attempt at trickery? Of course it's here.
We simply haven't found it yet. 
VASH: Are you saying that the professor's findings were wrong? 
PICARD: It would appear so. 
VASH: But how could that be? His evidence was overwhelming. 
GUEST3: Enough with this foolishness. Can't you see he's trying to
deceive us? Return to work this instant! 
VASH: I'm afraid he's right, Sovak. According to the disc we should
have reached it hours ago. 
GUEST3: Lies! Treachery! This cannot be happening. Not another failure.
Not after having come so close. 
GUEST4: It is most puzzling. 
(The aliens beam away) 
PICARD: It's over, Sovak. 
GUEST3: No, I will not be cheated out of my prize. Tell him. Tell him
the professor's research is irrefutable. 
VASH: I don't know anymore. 
GUEST3: Then step aside. 
(Sovak starts digging for himself) 
GUEST3: The Uthat is here, somewhere. It's just waiting to be found. It
can't hide from me forever.
