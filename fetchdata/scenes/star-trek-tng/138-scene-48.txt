RIKER: And for the last thirty eight years I have
survived here. I have come to understand that the alien contaminators
created this place for me out of some sense of guilt, presuming that
the novel we had on board the shuttle about the Hotel Royale was in
fact a guide to our preferred lifestyle and social habits. Obviously,
they thought this was the world from which I came.

RIKER [OC]: I hold no malice toward my benefactors.
They could not possibly know the hell they have put me through.

RIKER: for it was such a badly written book, filled
with endless clich and shallow characters. I shall welcome death when
it comes.

PICARD: I understand, Number One. Now we know why
all that is there.
