PICARD: Initiate sensor sweeps. 
DATA: Aye, sir. The system's sun has entered a period of severe flare
activity. 
RIKER: Now we know what triggered the SOS. 
DATA: Class M readings from the fifth planet in the system. 
PICARD: Take us in. 
WORF: Shields at maximum. 
DATA: Sensors indicate human life form readings thirty metres below the
planet's surface. 
WORF: Hailing on all frequencies. No response so far, but the flares
may be interfering with communications. 
DATA: There is no evidence of an advanced communication network. 
PICARD: They brought a lot of technology. Where is it? 
WORF: There is no artificial power source on the planet. 
DATA: The stellar flares are increasing in magnitude and frequency.
Computer projections indicate they will brush the planet in three point
six hours. 
WORF: Evacuation will be difficult. We can lower our shields for
transport only between the flares. 
TROI: Captain, these people have been isolated for three hundred years.
They could be very unsophisticated. The shock of suddenly being
transported onto a spaceship could frighten them, to say the least. 
PICARD: Your point is well taken, Counsellor. Number One, you're going
to have to go down there. 
RIKER: On my way.

Captain's log, stardate 42827.3. Commander Riker
has reached the caverns, where he is making preparations to begin the
evacuation.

PICARD: What's the situation, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: There are roughly two hundred people down here. 
PICARD: Their condition? 
RIKER [OC]: Surprisingly good. 
PICARD: Are they willing to leave? 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, but 
PICARD: Well, get them up here. 
RIKER [OC]: I'm having a little debate with the colony's leader. It
seems 
PICARD: There's no time, Number One. Initiate the transport. 
RIKER [OC]: But, sir 
PICARD: Whatever the problem, we'll handle it up here. 
RIKER [OC]: Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way. All of us. Riker out.
