(Guinan strolls in and is greeted by a gun) 
JOHNNY: Get inside. Close the door. Who's the doll? 
PICARD: She's a, the doll's my cousin. 
GUINAN: Yeah. Gloria. From Cleveland. 
PICARD: I'm sorry about this Gu, Gloria. I didn't actually mean you to
get involved. She knows nothing about this, Johnny. 
(Johnny gestures her to raise her hands) 
GUINAN: What does that mean? Oh, I see. 
JOHNNY: Yeah, right. What do I look like? A jamoke? You ain't nobody's
cousin and you ain't here for a visit. What do you know about my money?

GUINAN: Your money? 
JOHNNY: The money he stole. 
GUINAN: You stole his money? 
PICARD: Don't listen to him, Gloria. He's lying. 
GUINAN: Johnny. Johnny. Talk to me, Johnny. I'm a great listener. 
JOHNNY: I'm finished with talking, sweetheart. Now, I'm going to get
some action or else. 
(rapid gunfire, Picard and Guinan duck, and Johnny falls dead) 
GUINAN: This is what you do for fun? 
PICARD: It's a mystery. Who was this man? Who killed him? Where's the
money he was talking about? It's a mystery. Now, we have to go search
for clues. 
GUINAN: Ah, and that's fun? 
(tyre squeal outside) 
PICARD: That's fun. A forty eight Packard with white walls. Damn it, I
couldn't get the license plate. 
MADELINE [OC]: Captain Picard? Sorry, there's no Captain Picard here.
You should try down at the docks. Ships come 
PICARD: It's all right, Madeline, I'll take it in here. 
(picks up the phone) 
PICARD: Yes, what is it? 
DATA [OC]: Captain, Lieutenant Commander Data here. Please excuse the
unusual interruption, but under the circumstances I thought that
patching communications through the holodeck programme would be less
obtrusive. 
PICARD: I appreciate your concern, Commander Data. What can I do for
you?
