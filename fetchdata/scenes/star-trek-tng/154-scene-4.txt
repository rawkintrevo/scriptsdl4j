[Corridor]

PICARD: Indulge me, Number One. 
RIKER: I would prefer it if Lieutenant Worf and I were able to a
security sweep of the ship first. 
PICARD: No. Captain's prerogative. This one's mine. We have examined
every conceivable risk. 
RIKER: The risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable,
Captain. 
PICARD: Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed of climbing
inside the bottle? 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: The ship in the bottle. Model air ships. I used to build them
when I was a child. My God, I bet I had a Promellian battle cruiser
too.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Ready to beam down to the vessel? 
O'BRIEN: Locked on to the main bridge, Captain. 
RIKER: You're certain about the atmospheric conditions, Data ? 
DATA: There is adequate oxygen for life support, Commander. 
PICARD: It is exactly as they left it, Number One. In the bottle. The
ship in the bottle. Good Lord, didn't anybody here build ships in
bottles when they were boys? 
WORF: I did not play with toys. 
DATA: I was never a boy. 
O'BRIEN: I did, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Proceed. 
(Picard, Worf and Data are beamed away) 
O'BRIEN: I did. I really did. Ships in bottles. Great fun. 
(The lights dim) 
RIKER: What's that? 
O'BRIEN: I'm not sure. The secondary power bus may need adjusting. 
RIKER: Keep me posted.
