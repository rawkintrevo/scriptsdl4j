RIKER ANAYA WORF PICARD BARCLAY DATA LAFORGE

[Bridge]

WORF: Probe now closing at fifteen point three
metres per second. Collision course. 
DATA: Captain, sensors are reading no particulate emissions or subspace
field distortions. 
PICARD: Then how is it able to move? 
DATA: Method of propulsion is unknown, sir. 
RIKER: Ensign, take us away from it. One quarter impulse. 
ANAYA: (the lady at helm) Aye, sir. 
WORF: The probe is matching our speed and course. 
DATA: Captain, an energy field is forming around the device. Intensity
is three point two terawatts and increasing. 
WORF: Sir, the shuttlecraft shields did not provide sufficient
protection for its computer. Our computer may also be vulnerable. I
recommend withdrawal to a safe distance. 
PICARD: Ensign Anaya, full about. Half impulse. 
ANAYA: One half impulse. 
WORF: The probe is following. 
PICARD: Options, Number One? 
RIKER: We can't use photon torpedoes. An explosion this close could
cripple us. 
WORF: Sir, recommend full phasers. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
WORF: Firing phasers. 
(the probe just glows a bit more) 
WORF: No effect, Captain. 
DATA: The probe's field intensity is continuing to build, sir. We are
in danger. 
RIKER: Riker to La Forge. Can you increase phaser power?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Attempting to now, Commander. Isolate
phasers eighty to one twenty. Shunt all the plasma 
BARCLAY: To the emitters. Yes, sir, I'm already on it. Ready. 
LAFORGE: Phasers are as hot as we can make them, Captain.
