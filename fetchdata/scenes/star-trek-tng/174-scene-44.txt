[Transporter room]

WORF: These phasers have been retuned. Each has a
different frequency spanning the upper EM band. 
SHELBY: All right, a reminder. We only get to use each of these once,
maybe twice, before the Borg learn to adapt. Don't fire until you have
to. 
CRUSHER: What kind of resistance should we expect? 
DATA: At our first encounter, the Borg virtually ignored us when we
beamed aboard their vessel. Clearly they did not consider our being
there a threat to them. 
SHELBY: That may change, however, if we start interfering with their
plans. Shelby to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

SHELBY [OC]: Away team ready. 
RIKER: We've got fifty eight minutes before we have to power down and
disengage. 
SHELBY [OC]: Understood. 
RIKER: Proceed. Commander 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: No unnecessary risks. Clear? 
SHELBY: Very clear, sir. Shelby out. 
O'BRIEN: We've matched warp velocity for transport, Commander. 
SHELBY: Energise.

[Borg ship]

WORF: Tricorder functions minimal. 
SHELBY: Any signs of human life? 
WORF: Inconclusive. 
(They go off down one of many similar walkways. There are Borg in their
alcoves all over the place) 
CRUSHER: Look at this. This is extraordinary. 
(An upside down pyramid on the ceiling, throbbing with power) 
DATA: These appear to be some kind of power wave guide conduits which
allow them to work collectively as they perform ship functions. 
SHELBY: There's no way to take out enough of these to disable them
down. 
CRUSHER: What if we look at this from a mosquito's point of view. 
DATA: Interesting metaphor, Doctor. What is your idea? 
CRUSHER: If we sting them in a tender spot, they might stop for a
minute to scratch. 
(Further on, at an intersection with control panels) 
DATA: Distribution nodes. 
SHELBY: If we take out a few of these, it just might make them scratch.

WORF: The Captain's communicator. It is still activated. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Picard. Can you hear me? 
SHELBY: Can you locate it, Worf? 
WORF: This way.

[Ready room]

RIKER: I strongly recommend redeploying all
available defences to protect sector zero zero one, Admiral. 
HANSON [on monitor]: We're moving to intercept at Wolf three five nine.
We'll make our stand there. How much longer can you maintain pursuit? 
RIKER: Twenty two minutes if they stay at current speed. If we can't
bring them out of warp, we'll do as much damage as we can before we
have to disengage. 
HANSON [on monitor]: Picard? 
RIKER: Nothing yet, sir.

[Borg ship]

WORF: In here. 
(Data gently pulls a drawer out of a wall. But there's no body in it) 
SHELBY: Shelby to Enterprise. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Go ahead. 
SHELBY [OC]: We've found the Captain's uniform and his communicator.
We're resuming our search. 
(La Forge and Wesley enter) 
RIKER: Stand by, Commander. 
WESLEY: We're in business. 
LAFORGE: It'll burn out the main deflector, but it'll be one hell of a
bang. 
RIKER: Radiation danger? 
WESLEY: We're going to have to evacuate the entire forward half of the
secondary hull and the lower three decks of the saucer. 
TROI: I'll see to that. 
RIKER: Commander Shelby 
[Borg ship]

RIKER [OC]: We have only seventeen minutes of warp
power left. Do whatever you can to get them out of warp. 
SHELBY: Acknowledged. Shelby out. Let's take out some of these
distribution nodes and see what happens. 
(Data's single phaser shot has no impact. Worf joining in makes it go
bang. Borg come out of their alcoves and the lights fluctuate. They
take out a second one, then a third) 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: Sir, they've done it. The Borg ship is
dropping out of warp. 
RIKER: Go to impulse. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: Diverting warp energy to main deflector. 
RIKER: Move us to within forty thousand kilometres. Match velocity.
Commence arming sequence. Increase deflector modulation to upper
frequency band. 
[Borg ship]

(Borg approach the away team. They shoot at least
two each) 
SHELBY: Shelby to Enterprise. Encountering resistance. Prepare to beam
us back on my signal. 
(The next wave of Borg are shielded) 
SHELBY: They're adapting to the frequencies. 
(We see a familiar profile) 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc! 
(He turns to face us, and a red laser attachment stares us in the eye) 
WORF: Captain! 
(Worf approaches Picard, but a forcefield knocks him down)
SHELBY: Enterprise, get us out of here.
