LAFORGE [OC]: An ant pushing a tricycle. A slim
chance at best. 
RIKER: Given a choice between slim and none, I'll take slim any day. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, contact all ships in this sector to rendezvous
and join us in relief efforts. 
PICARD: We'll keep you informed of our progress. Picard out. 
(The tiny tractor beam is sent out against the huge moon) 
RIKER: Can you give us any more, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Not without burning out the tractor beam emitter. The
circuits are already beyond the thermal limit. 
DATA: Delta vee is ninety two metres per second. The mass is too great.
We are having an effect but it is negligible. 
(A high-pitched noise penetrates the Bridge) 
RIKER: What is that? 
DATA: Unable to identify source.

LAFORGE: Impulse engines passing safety limits.

LAFORGE [OC]: From automatic shutdown. 
PICARD: Reduce engine power. Tractor beam off. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what the hell do the sensors say? 
WORF: The sound is not registering, Commander. 
(There is a bright flash, and a naked Q is suspended in mid air, lying
on his side, with modesty maintained by the camera angle) 
PICARD: Q! 
Q: Red alert. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We are no closer to

but with the arrival of Q, we now have a good idea of the cause.
