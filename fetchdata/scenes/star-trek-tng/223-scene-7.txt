CRUSHER: Leave him here. He won't survive.
RIKER: I think the Captain understands that.
CRUSHER: I don't.
RIKER: The Borg usually collect their dead. 
CRUSHER: He's not dead.
RIKER: The transmission 
CRUSHER: At least not yet.
RIKER: The transmission that we intercepted was probably a homing
signal. We have to assume they're on their way.
CRUSHER: Let me at least stabilise his condition, give him a chance of
surviving until they get here.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Your concern is noted, Doctor, but any
intervention on our part would alert the Borg to our having been here.

[Crash site]

CRUSHER: I'm afraid we've turned that corner
already.
WORF: Kill it now. Make it appear that it died in the crash. 
[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: Leave no evidence that we were ever
here. 
PICARD: Security measures must be taken before we beam it on board. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Thank you, Captain. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, notify Security to prepare a detention cell.

LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: We're bringing a Borg survivor on board. We'll need to
neutralise the homing signal 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Prevent it from sending or receiving
transmissions of any kind.
LAFORGE: I'll set up a subspace damping field around the detention
cell. 
PICARD [OC]: Very well.
