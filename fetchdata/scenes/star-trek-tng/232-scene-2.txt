RIKER AMANDA

[Corridor]

RIKER: It'll take a few days before you know where
everything is. If you need any help, you just use one of these comm.
panels. 
AMANDA: We're on deck seven, section four. 
RIKER: You're right. 
AMANDA: I practically memorised the specs on the way over here. 
RIKER: You're a quick study. This is it.

[Amanda's quarters]

AMANDA: Is this for me? 
RIKER: It's all yours. 
AMANDA: It's so big. 
RIKER: For honour students, only the best. 
AMANDA: Well, I could've brought my zoo. 
RIKER: Your zoo? 
AMANDA: That's just what my parents call it. Three dogs isn't that
many, is it? 
RIKER: It depends how they get along. 
AMANDA: I could have a dozen. Mother said enough is enough. I'm sure
going to miss 'em. 
RIKER: We'll keep you so busy you won't have a chance to. I've got to
get going. I have to get back to cargo bay two. 
AMANDA: Well, thanks for walking me down. 
RIKER: Sure. 
(Riker leaves) 
AMANDA: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it. 
(I count ten puppies) 
AMANDA: You guys can't stay here. (some vanish) Come on, all of you. 
(she picks up the last two) 
AMANDA: Hello. Come here, little one. You too. Come on, come on. 
(she puts them down and they vanish)
