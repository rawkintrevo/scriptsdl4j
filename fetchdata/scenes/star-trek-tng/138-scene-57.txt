[Observation lounge]

PULASKI: Correct. The cryogenic process would be
nearly instantaneous. 
RIKER [OC]: But I assume you could revive us? 
PULASKI: Yes. 
[Hotel room]

PULASKI [OC]: In theory. 
PICARD [OC]: You must understand, Number One 
[Observation lounge]

PICARD: We'll wait here for months if necessary.
We're just considering options. 
RIKER [OC]: If you're trying to motivate us to find 
[Hotel room]

RIKER: Our own way out of here, you've succeeded,
Captain. 
(The telephone rings, and Worf answers it) 
WORF: Yes? There is a female voice asking if we want room service. 
DATA: I believe she is asking if we want the room cleaned. 
RIKER: Tell her no. 
WORF: No. 
RIKER: What did she say? 
WORF: She said the kitchen will be open twenty four hours if we change
our minds. 
RIKER: We're going to explore the rest of the hotel. We'll keep a comm.
line open. You two go down to the lobby and see if there's anything
that we've missed. You talk to the guests and try to find out who or
what they are. I'll check out the rest of the floors. 

[Ready room]

PICARD: Computer, locate and display the text of
the novel entitled Hotel Royale by Todd Matthews. 
COMPUTER: Accessing. 
PICARD: If the cause of the difficulties is in the novel, we may find
the solution within its pages. Ah. (reading)
'It was a dark and
stormy night'. It's not a promising beginning. 
TROI: It may get better. 
[Casino]

DATA: I suggest we separate and blend in with these
beings. Casual queries, offered inconspicuously, may prove fruitful. 
(Data heads to the table with Texas and Vanessa) 
VANESSA: I need a four. Give me a four. 
TEXAS: Oh, shoot. 
VANESSA: How much do I have left here? 
TEXAS: Honey, now you know it's bad luck to count your chips at the
table. 
VANESSA: Yeah? 
DATA: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire, where are you from? 
TEXAS: Lubbock, Texas. 
DATA: And how did you get here? 
TEXAS: To Vegas? Drove my car. I got a ninety one Caddy with only
eighty thousand miles on it. 
DATA: Where is your automobile now? 
TEXAS: Out front, I suppose. What the hell difference does it make? 
DATA: Could you take me there? 
VANESSA: Hit me. I'm losing my shirt. 
TEXAS: Son, why would I want to do that? Can't you see I'm trying to to
help this little lady? 
DATA: I believe you are trapped inside the Royale, just as I am. 
TEXAS: Sure does seem that way when you're losing, don't it? We're just
trying to turn this lady's wagon around, and win back some lost change.
Otherwise she's in a desperate situation and she's got nowhere to turn.
Well, almost nowhere. 
VANESSA: I stay, right? (holding thirteen) 
TEXAS: I wouldn't. 
DATA: The odds favour standing pat. 
VANESSA: What do I do? 
TEXAS: Do you want a card or what? 
VANESSA: Hit me. (a Jack) Too many. I've almost lost it all. What am I
going to do? 
TEXAS: There, there, there, there, there. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: What did you find? 
WORD: Nothing. 
CLERK: Rita just called. 
BELLBOY: She did? What did she say? 
CLERK: It was kind of hard to tell. She was crying. 
BELLBOY: Crying? Damn. Mickey D thinks he can treat people any way he
wants. Well, that's all over now. 
(Enter Mickey D through the main door, white suit with overcoat draped
across his shoulders) 
MICKEY D: You were told. 
BELLBOY: It's not for you to make the call. It's for Rita. 
MICKEY D: She sent me to tell you. 
CLERK: Okay, boys. Look, we can't afford to have any trouble in here.
Why don't you just take this outside. 
MICKEY D: Yeah, I like that. Come on, baggage man. 
[Ready room]

(Troi and Picard are listening on the open comm.
channel) 
MICKEY D [OC]: Let's you and me take it outside. 
BELLBOY [OC]: When I was a kid, I used to look up to you guys. The
suit, the fancy shoes. I really thought that made you somebody, but
you're nobody. She could make something out of her life 
(Picard mutes it) 
TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? 
PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on down
there is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. 
BELLBOY [OC]: Like Rita. She could do something with her life. She
could be somebody if she only had the chance. 
TROI: With your permission, sir. 
(Troi leaves) 
MICKEY D [OC]: She is somebody. She's my girl. 
BELLBOY [OC]: You got her on the stuff. That's the only reason she
stays with you. Because you feed her sickness. 
[Lobby]

BELLBOY: You got to let me help her. 
MICKEY D: Well why don't we just go outside and talk about it? 
CLERK: Just watch yourself. 
BELLBOY: Don't worry. 
RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. 
(Mickey D shoots the bellboy in the back as he walks to the door. The
customers scream) 
MICKEY D: You should have listened to me, kid. No woman's worth dying
for. Killing for, not dying for. 
(Mickey D leaves) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise.
