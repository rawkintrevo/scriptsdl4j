LAFORGE: That's her. 
WORF: Which one? 
LAFORGE: The one on the right. Don't stare. 
WORF: Why not? 
LAFORGE: Because she'll see. 
WORF: Good. You must let her see the fire in your eyes. 
LAFORGE: But what would I say? 
WORF: Words come later. It is the scent that first speaks of love. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Worf. That helps a lot. 
(A girl in a short skirt brings a couple of glasses back to the bar) 
CHRISTI: Hi, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Hi. 
CHRISTI: So, how have you been? 
LAFORGE: Good. I, er.
CHRISTI: How are things down in Engineering? 
LAFORGE: Fine. They, they've been fine. 
CHRISTI: Well, I'll see you around. 
(She leaves him, and he puts his head on the bar) 
WORF: I have much to teach you about women. 
RIKER [OC]: Mister La Forge, report to Transporter room three.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: What's this all about, Commander? 
RIKER: Sensors have discovered a small one-man spaceship crashed on the
planet. 
CRUSHER: We're picked up life-signs, humanoid, very faint and fading.

[Planet surface]

(A harsh, rocky place littered with bits of metal) 
DATA: Radiation levels within acceptable limits. 
(There is a man tumbled out the back of a shuttlecraft sized ship. The
man has a badly burned face) 
LAFORGE: We can beam him out from under there, get him right up to
Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: He's not stable enough for transport. There's damage to his
brain stem, autonomic functions are failing. His heart needs active
neurofeedback. It can't regulate itself. I need a volunteer. 
LAFORGE: Right here. 
CRUSHER: I'm going to hook your nervous systems to the tricorder. Your
brain will regulate both systems. That
should stabilise him long enough to get him up to the ship. 
CRUSHER: Take deep, regular breaths. If anything goes wrong I'll break
the connection. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
(Something golden leaps from the injured man into Geordi's head via the
neural thingummyjig) 
CRUSHER: Geordi! 
LAFORGE: I'm fine. No problem. 
CRUSHER: Transporter room, three to beam directly to Sickbay.
