PICARD PHILLIPA NAKAMURA

[Starbase 173]

(Enterprise is docked at a space station. You can
see her from the window) 
(Picard is relaxing in the coffee lounge when he sees a woman at the
top of the stairs) 
PICARD: My God. (He walks over to her) Phillipa Louvois. And back in
uniform. It's been ten years, but seeing you again like this makes it
seem like fifty. If we weren't around all these people, do you know
what I would like to do? 
PHILLIPA: Bust a chair across my teeth? 
PICARD: After that. 
PHILLIPA: Ain't love wonderful. 
(They sit together at a table) 
PICARD: So, what are you doing out here? 
PHILLIPA: I am in charge of the Twenty third Sector JAG office. We're
brand new. I have no staff but one terrified little Ensign. Hopefully
we can make some good law out here. 
PICARD: Anything is possible. So you came back to Starfleet. 
PHILLIPA: Still the most exciting and worthwhile place to be. 
PICARD: You had no reason to leave. 
PHILLIPA: They forced me out. 
PICARD: No. That was your own damn stubborn pride. 
PHILLIPA: When I prosecuted you in the Stargazer court martial, I was
doing my job. 
PICARD: Oh, you did more than your job. You enjoyed it. 
PHILLIPA: Not true! A court martial is standard procedure when a ship
is lost. I was doing my duty as an officer of the Judge Advocate
General. 
PICARD: You always enjoyed the adversarial process more than arriving
at the truth. Well, I hope you've learned a little wisdom along the
way. 
PHILLIPA: You know, I never thought I would say this, but it's good to
see you again. It brings a sense of order and stability to my universe
to know that you're still a pompous ass. And a damn sexy man. 
NAKAMURA: Captain Picard?
PHILLIPA: Admiral. 
NAKAMURA: Captain Louvois. You're acquainted with Captain Picard? 
PHILLIPA: Oh, yes. We're old friends. Excuse me. Picard, call me. You
can buy me dinner. 
(Phillipa exits) 
NAKAMURA: Captain, it's good to see you again. 
PICARD: Admiral. 
NAKAMURA: May I present Commander Bruce Maddox. 
PICARD: Commander. 
NAKAMURA: He has an interesting proposal for you, but that can wait for
a while. I'm eager to see the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Yes, sir. This way.
