PICARD TROI DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I don't understand it, Captain. All of a
sudden, cargo bay five started to depressurise. 
PICARD: Did everyone get out in time? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and I've re-established the containment field, but
I'm reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of
transporter activity. Something weird is happening there, Captain. 
PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find out
what's going on. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

LAFORGE: It looks like the ship's replicator and
transporter systems have been merged somehow. to create this. The
question is, what is it? Ensign, I want to run a full spectral analysis
on this. 
(the ship shakes and a barrel falls) 
LAFORGE: I'm picking up a massive power fluctuations. The ship is
losing its structural integrity.
