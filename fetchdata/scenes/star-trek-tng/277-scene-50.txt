RIKER OBRIEN LAFORGE PICARD GAINES DATA

[Future - Bridge]

GAINES: Entering the Devron system, sir. 
RIKER: Full stop. 
DATA: Sensors are picking up a small temporal anomaly off the port bow.

RIKER: On screen. 
PICARD: I was right. 
LAFORGE: It's an anti-time eruption. It seems to have been formed
within the last six hours. 
PICARD: We must stop it here so it can't travel back through time. 
RIKER: Mister Data, we need a solution and we need it now. 
DATA: The anomaly is being sustained by the continuing tachyon pulses
in the other two time periods. I suggest shutting them down. 
PICARD: The next time I'm there, it's the first thing I'll do. 
RIKER: Isn't there something more we can do here to seal the rupture
somehow? 
DATA: I will investigate the options.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, disengage the tachyon pulse. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Do it. The convergence of the tachyon pulses from the three
time periods is what is causing the anomaly. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Is there any change in the anomaly? 
[Past - Bridge]

DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Disengage the tachyon pulse. 
O'BRIEN: but e haven't finished the scan, sir. 
PICARD: I know that. But it is imperative that you disengage the
tachyon pulse immediately. 
DATA: Aye, sir. Disengaging. 
PICARD: Why isn't the anomaly being affected? 
O'BRIEN: Why would it be, sir?
