TASHA: We'd better find a defensive position. If
Data's right 
RIKER: He usually is. 
TASHA: We're going to have company any minute now, and this time I
don't know how we're going to stop it.

Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in
command of the star drive section. After separating from the saucer, we
have returned to Minos to rescue the away team. Unfortunately, I have
only one option left, and it's a long shot. 
[Battle Bridge]

T'SU: Shields and deflectors are up. 
LAFORGE: Ensign T'Su, when I order the shields down, you have one
responsibility. Locate the away team and get them up here. You may only
have a few seconds. 
SOLIS: Approaching the planet, sir. 
LAFORGE: Ride's going to get a little bumpy. Things are going to happen
fast. Just keep alert, stay calm. Let's focus on what we're doing. You
know your jobs. You've been trained, you've been tested. You've earned
the right to sit in those chairs.

[Cavern]

PICARD: That sound again. 
DATA: Another weapon has been launched, sir. 
PICARD: We've got to find some way to stop this system. 
DATA: I would need to see the programme schematic. 
SALESMAN: You've got it. 
PICARD: Is it possible to re-adjust the targeting sequence? 
SALESMAN: Absolutely. It wouldn't be much good without it. 
PICARD: Data, assign it a neutral target. 
DATA: The target must be specific, sir. 
PICARD: Itself, then. Itself or it's own power source. 
DATA: The force of that explosion would destroy this cavern and
everyone on the surface. 
SALESMAN: Watch now. This is the fourth and final projectile. The Echo
Papa series Six Oh Seven is about to complete this phase of its
mission.

[Planet Surface]

TASHA: We could split up. 
RIKER: What good would that do? 
TASHA: Confuse it, delay it. Something. 
RIKER: It would still get us. It would just take a little longer. 
TASHA: It might give one of us long enough to get out of range. 
RIKER: Out of range? 
TASHA: Forget I said it. These devices wiped out an entire planet. I
don't think it has a range. 
RIKER: Then what does that leave us? Right. That's what I thought. 
(a blast behind them) 
TASHA: On the other hand, we could look for deeper cover. 
RIKER: You got any ideas? 
TASHA: None. 
[Cavern]

PICARD: Give me some options, Data, quickly. 
CRUSHER: Why don't you just shut it off? 
PICARD: Is that possible? 
CRUSHER: Why not? It's a machine, isn't it? 
PICARD: Shut it off. 
SALESMAN: Why? You haven't seen half of what this beauty can do. 
PICARD: We've seen enough. 
SALESMAN: Does that mean you're going to buy it? 
PICARD: Yes. Yes, we've seen enough. You've made a sale. 
SALESMAN: You won't be sorry. 
PICARD: Good. Now end the demonstration. 
SALESMAN: Done. 
(The salesman disappears, and so does the 'projectile') 

[Planet Surface]

(Tasha's mouth is wide open)
PICARD [OC]: Number One! 
RIKER: Right here. That was close.

[Cavern]

PICARD: La Forge, everything's alright. We've
neutralised it.
