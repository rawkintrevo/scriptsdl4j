(the lounge is in darkness when he enters, then) 
ALL: Surprise! 
WESLEY: Mom! 
CRUSHER: Welcome home. 
WESLEY: Hi, Mom. 
PICARD: Wesley. 
WESLEY: Captain. 
PICARD: Quomodo tua Latinitas est? 
WESLEY: Praestat quam prius. 
PICARD: Oppido bonum. Your Latin has improved. 
TROI: You're looking very handsome. 
CRUSHER: You really do that cadet uniform justice, Wesley. 
LAFORGE: I bet you're driving all the girls wild. 
WORF: Wesley. Tarvokian pound cake. I made it myself. 
WESLEY: Thanks, Worf. 
DATA: Wesley, was our attempt to make you uncomfortable effective? 
WESLEY: You bet it was. For a second there, I thought I was on the
wrong ship. 
DATA: Did you find our deception pleasing? 
WESLEY: Yeah. It's fun to be surprised. 
RIKER: Are you here to work or to play, Mister Crusher? 
WESLEY: Sir. 
RIKER: I know you're on vacation. Probably like to sleep and spend some
time on the holodeck. But if you're so inclined, we could use your help
with the Phoenix Cluster survey. 
WESLEY: Sounds great, sir. 
LAFORGE: Excellent. As soon as you get settled, come down to
Engineering and we'll get you started. 
CRUSHER: So what kind of game is this? 
TROI: Come by my quarters and I'll show it to you.

DATA: Have you found the Academy challenging,
Wesley? 
WESLEY: Yeah. I thought after being on the Enterprise, it would be a
breeze, but there's a lot more to learn than just starship operations.
What was your first year like? 
DATA: Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of human
understanding often created social obstacles. 
WESLEY: Like what? 
DATA: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes,
several of which I fell victim to. 
WESLEY: Tell me about it. My first week that I was there, this guy
named Adam Martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud.
It took me a while, but I got him back really good. 
DATA: Good for you. 
WESLEY: Thanks. 
DATA: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an
Academy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? 
WESLEY: They still hold it, every year. 
DATA: A notably awkward experience. 
WESLEY: I know what you mean. I can't even dance. 
DATA: Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. 
WESLEY: The Dancing Doctor? She tried to teach me too, but I just don't
have the knack. 
DATA: I would be happy to teach you dancing. I have programmed a
comprehensive seventeen part
course with some interesting holographic partners. 
WESLEY: I'll let you know.
