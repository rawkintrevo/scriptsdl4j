[Romulan office]

(Pardek, a stocky man, enters) 
NERAL: Ah, Senator Pardek. You received my message.
PARDEK: I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.
NERAL: What do you know of this human? Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet
Captain. 
PARDEK: I know nothing of him.
NERAL: You haven't seen him recently?
PARDEK: To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
NERAL: I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here.
Perhaps here already.
PARDEK: Here on Romulus?
NERAL: Yes. Curious, isn't it. I suppose we'd better find out if the
report is accurate or merely rumour. Circulate his likeness among the
security forces. Remind them that if he is here, he's probably
disguised as one of us.
PARDEK: I'll see to it.

[Romulan street]

DATA: This is definitely the street on which the
intelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir. Adjusting for the
optical distortions, I am able to verify the architectural features.
PICARD: Where were they standing? Data, you're moving about in a very,
well, android way.
DATA: I am sorry, Captain. I will be more careful.
PICARD: Don't call me Captain.
DATA: I understand, sir. I have found the place where they were
standing. 
PICARD: Where?
DATA: It is here, at this doorway. A legal intercessor's office. The
name is similar to Pardek's. It would appear to be one of his relatives.
(Picard knocks, then tries the handle) 
PICARD: He's not open for business yet. 
DATA: Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I have clearly determined
Pardek's routine. On days when the Senate is not in session, he
invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
PICARD: Very well. Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we?
