LAFORGE: If we're going to maintain our realignment
progressions we shouldn't be pushing warp eight for at least an hour.

PICARD: Commander. 
(The lights dim) 
COMPUTER: Evacuate Bridge. Deck one life support failure in thirty
seconds. 
RIKER: Turbolifts two, three, four, everyone. 
PICARD: Transfer helm to Engineering, Geordi. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: La Forge, let's get a diagnostic sweep underway. 
COMPUTER: Evacuate Bridge. Deck one life support failure in twenty
seconds. 
PICARD: Reassemble in Engineering. 
(Data is the only one left on the Bridge) 
COMPUTER: Evacuate Bridge. Deck one life support failure in ten
seconds. 
(Data starts working on a rear science station) 
COMPUTER: Deck one life support has been terminated.

KOPF: Our velocity is holding steady at warp nine
point three. Do you wish to override, Commander? 
LAFORGE: No, not yet. Computer, isolate cause of life support failure. 
COMPUTER: Atmosphere conditioning pumps on deck one are operating in
negative mode. 
LAFORGE: How could that be? There are seven independent safety
interlocks to prevent that. 
(Picard and Worf enter, then others) 
LAFORGE: Captain, I believe we've found the problem, but it really
doesn't make sense. 
PICARD: Bring the Enterprise to a full stop, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Full stop, Ensign. 
KOPF: It's not responding, sir. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to have to do this at the manual input level, sir.
Wes. 
RIKER: We're still at the altered heading, Captain, holding at warp
nine point three. 
WORF: Captain. Force fields have been established on all main Bridge
turbolift doors and service crawlways. 
PICARD: Computer, locate Lieutenant Commander Data. 
COMPUTER: Commander Data is on the main Bridge. 
RIKER: What the hell is he up to? 
PICARD: Number One, take a security team up to deck two. Try and break
through from below. Commander? 
LAFORGE: Everything's locked up, Captain. We have no control of impulse
or warp engines from here. 
WESLEY: Navigation's not responding either, sir. 
PICARD: Picard to main bridge.
