(The hole in the hull is a lot bigger) 
KARGAN: What is the status? 
TACTICS: Unchanged. The rate of increase continues. 
KARGAN: Commander Riker, check the organism growth with Engineering. 
(Riker leaves) 
KARGAN: Keep him under scrutiny. 
KLAG: Captain, I'm not convinced Riker knew of any plot against us. If
he did, why would he have come on board? 
KARGAN: Because he was ordered to. 
KLAG: To die? 
KARGAN: It's the expectation of any officer to be ordered to die at any
time. 
KLAG: For a Klingon perhaps, but Riker's people do not volunteer for
death so easily. He may be a spy, but he's no coward. 
KARGAN: That only proves that he is intelligent. And you might not be
as strong as you used to be. 
TACTICS: Captain, I've picked up the Enterprise. 
KARGAN: So soon? 
TACTICS: The Enterprise is on an intercept course with us. 
(Riker enters) 
KARGAN: You almost had me believing this was a misunderstanding. 
RIKER: But? 
KARGAN: The Enterprise has changed course and is following us. Why? 
RIKER: Ask them. 
KARGAN: The reason is obvious. Their intent is clear. How long before
we make contact? 
TACTICS: Less than fifteen minutes, sir. 
KARGAN: Put the ship on full battle alert. Arm all photon torpedoes.
Let them charge into their destruction.

WESLEY: Captain, our bearings show that we should
be in contact with the Klingon vessel now. 
DATA: Slow to impulse. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Impulse speed. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies are open. There is no response. 
PICARD: Continue transmitting. 
DATA: The Pagh is either cloaked or destroyed, sir. 
PICARD: Conduct an intensive scan of the area.
