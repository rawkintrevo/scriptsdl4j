RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD DATA NAKAMURA

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, incoming message from Admiral
Nakamura. 
PICARD: On screen. 
PICARD: Admiral. 
NAKAMURA [on viewscreen]: Captain. We were expecting you this morning.
Is there a problem? 
PICARD: Actually, we have been experiencing a few minor difficulties
with our new warp core, but my Chief Engineer assures me that we will
be under way within the hour. 
NAKAMURA [on viewscreen]: You're not trying to avoid this particular
engagement, are you, Picard? 
PICARD: No, no, certainly not. I'm really looking forward to it. 
NAKAMURA [on viewscreen]: Good. I'll expect you soon. Nakamura out. 
RIKER: I think he's on to you, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Geordi.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We've just started it up, Captain. All
systems are holding steady. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Ready when you are, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign Gates, set a course and engage. 
(this time they start to go, and then stop) 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Engineering, report. 
DATA: The warp field has collapsed, sir. 
LAFORGE: It looks like we've blown the entire power converter, Captain.
Impulse engines are down too. We're not going anywhere. But I know just
how to fix this. Give me two, three hours, tops. 
LAFORGE: Now what?

[Bridge]

RIKER: Talk about going nowhere fast. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, open a channel to Starbase two nineteen. Advise
Admiral Nakamura I'll be a little later than I thought. 
WORF: Aye, sir.
