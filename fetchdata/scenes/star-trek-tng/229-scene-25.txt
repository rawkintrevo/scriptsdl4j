RIKER WORF PICARD TROI ALKAR CHIEF COMPUTER OGAWA CRUSHER

[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: All right, Deanna, just what the hell is all
this?
TROI: Imzadi, do you still care about me?
RIKER: Of course I care about you. I'm worried about you. What's all
this?
TROI: Don't you think I'm attractive?
RIKER: This just isn't you.
TROI: Oh, it is. You want me, don't you?
(she pulls him in for a kiss) 
RIKER: Deanna.
TROI: I need you.
(Her long nails scratch his neck, drawing blood) 
RIKER: What is this?
TROI: Please! 
(Next morning, Troi is in uniform when the doorbell rings) 
TROI: Come in.
ALKAR: Deanna, I'm leaving for the surface.
(She turns to us, showing her grey hair and lined face) 
TROI: You said you'd take me with you.
ALKAR: I know, but that's not possible now.
TROI: You told me I'd be helpful. You needed me.
ALKAR: And I still do. You've done so much for me.
TROI: Then take me. Don't leave me here. Is Liva going with you?
ALKAR: She's been on Seronia for weeks. She knows the people, the
situation.
TROI: She wants to take you away from me.
ALKAR: Deanna, you are my anchor. I need you more than you can possibly
realise. Do you understand that? I need you here, making it possible
for me to do my work.
TROI: I won't let her have you! I'll stop her! (she follows him into
the corridor) I will go with you. Take me with you. Please, Alkar.
Don't leave me. Don't do this! No!

[Crusher's office]

(Will is getting his scratches healed) 
RIKER: You wouldn't have recognised her. Her dress, her hair,
everything about her. I'm closer to Deanna than I've ever been to
anyone, but last night she was someone that I had never seen before.
CRUSHER: And you don't know of anything that might have caused her to
behave like that?
RIKER: No. I've thought and thought about it. I don't have an answer.
CRUSHER: Computer, location of Counsellor Troi.
COMPUTER: Deck six, corridor B. 
CRUSHER: Let's go.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Ambassador, I came to alert you that the
Rekags and the Seronians are in disagreement about the seating
arrangements at the conference table.
ALKAR: I'm not surprised.
PICARD: The good news, however, is that the cease fire seems to be
holding.
ALKAR: And that is by far the best news. Thank you, Captain.
PICARD: Chief. 
(Troi enters, looking even older) 
TROI: Will you take me with you?
PICARD: Deanna? 
ALKAR: Deanna, I've already told you I can't
TROI: I won't let her have you 
(Troi produces a knife, and Picard wrestles her for it, getting cut in
the process. The transporter chief and Jarth pull her off him) 
PICARD: Security to Transporter room two.
TROI: Don't try and stop me! No, no, let go! 
(Riker and Crusher enter) 
PICARD: It's nothing, it's superficial. What happened to Deanna?
CRUSHER: All of the systems in her body have elevated readings. Take
her to Sickbay. I want to see you in Sickbay too. 
ALKAR: Captain, perhaps we should delay transporting to the surface. 
PICARD: No. You should proceed with your mission.
ALKAR: Very well.
PICARD: Chief, transport them to the planet surface.
CHIEF: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

(Troi is writhing in a restraining forcefield) 
CRUSHER: We'll have to sedate her. Twenty cc's of melorazine.
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor.
CRUSHER: How's it feeling?
PICARD: It's a little stiff, but it'll be fine.
CRUSHER: It'll disappear in a day or two.
OGAWA: Doctor Crusher? I think you should see these readings, Doctor.
Her neurotransmitter levels are three hundred percent above normal.
CRUSHER: If you remember, I found extremely high levels of
neurotransmitter residue in Alkar's mother.
PICARD: Could Deanna have picked up some kind of disease from her?
CRUSHER: I don't know. I need to do that autopsy. I don't care about
the customs of Alkar's people. I need to find out if there's a
connection between what killed Maylor and what's happening to Troi.
PICARD: Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
WORF [OC]: Worf here, Captain.
PICARD: Mister Worf, contact Ambassador Alkar. I need to speak with
him. 
OGAWA: Doctor, neural energy is now three hundred forty percent above
normal. 
WORF [OC]: Captain, Ambassador Alkar is at the negotiation table and
cannot be disturbed.
PICARD: Proceed with the autopsy. 
Medical log, stardate 46075.1. I have performed an
autopsy on Alkar's mother, but instead of answering our questions, the
results have created an even deeper mystery.
