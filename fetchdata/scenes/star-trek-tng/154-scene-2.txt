[Ten forward]

(Wesley and Data are playing 3D chess. Outside is a
field of planetary fragments) 
WESLEY: This was the final battle, wasn't it? 
DATA: Neither side intended Orelious Nine to be the decisive conflict. 
WESLEY: There's not much left, is there. 
DATA: The destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weapons
of the period. 
(Geordi enters, disconsolate and back in uniform) 
WESLEY: Uh, oh. 
DATA: I beg your pardon, Wesley? 
WESLEY: Geordi had a big date with Christy tonight. He spent days
putting together the perfect
programme. Looks like it ended kind of early. 
DATA: Uh, oh. 
RIKER [OC]: Commander Data to the Bridge immediately. 
DATA: Acknowledged.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're picking up a signal, coordinates two
one one mark six one. 
PICARD: It would seen to be an ancient interplanetary code. Mister
Data? 
DATA: Confirmed, sir. 
RIKER: Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time? Not possible. 
PICARD: Well, hardly possible, Number One. Lay in a course to the
source of the signal. 
(short trip through the rubble) 
DATA: Approaching the source, Captain. 
PICARD: Put it on the viewer. 
WORF: A Promellian battle cruiser? 
PICARD: With its Lang-cycle fusion engines still intact. 
DATA: Sensors indicate no life signs aboard, Captain. 
PICARD: I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum.
I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probably
initiated over a thousand years ago.

Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived at
Orelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars and
Promellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we have
found a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the
centuries.
