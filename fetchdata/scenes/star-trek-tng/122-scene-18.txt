(As a vaguely humanoid shape rises wet and
glistening from the slick) 
RIKER: Trouble.

Captain's log, supplemental. While on a mission to
rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team has
encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different
forms, including one which resembles humanoid.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Easy, Number One. Let's find out what it is
we're dealing with. 
RIKER [OC]: Agreed, Captain. 
PICARD: Number One, I don't believe that the location of the crash and
the proximity of the creature is a coincidence. 

[Planet surface]

RIKER: I am Commander William Riker of the USS
Enterprise. 
ARMUS: I am Armus. Why are you here? 
RIKER: We mean you no harm. We have injured crewmen in the
shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass? 
ARMUS: You haven't given me a good enough reason. 
RIKER: Preserving life, all life, is very important to us. 
ARMUS: Why? 
RIKER: We believe everything in the universe has a right to exist. 
ARMUS: An interesting notion which I do not share. You may now leave,
if you wish. 
TASHA: We're not going without our shuttle crew. 
ARMUS: I warn you. 
TASHA: Enough! We have people who need attention. We won't hurt you,
but we must help them. 
(Armus lets lose a bolt of energy which sends Tasha flying a long way.
Riker and Data's phasers have no effect on Armus)
PICARD [OC]: Number One! 
RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. 
DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. 
RIKER: We had no effect on it. 
(Armus sinks back into the slick) 
PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! 
CRUSHER: She's dead.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, get them up, now. 
Transporter Room]

CRUSHER: I need her in Sickbay now. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert, Lieutenant Worf. I'll
be in Sickbay. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Status, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Unchanged. 
PICARD: Can you bring her back? 
CRUSHER: We'll see. Neural stimulator. 
NURSE: Neural stimulator locked in. 
CRUSHER: Interlock current feeds. Set sensitivity factor to four point
four. 
NURSE: Affirmative. 
NURSE 2: Monitoring two point three, one point eight. 
RIKER: You did it. 
CRUSHER: No. I've got her on full support. There is no independent
brain function. 
NURSE 2: Current feeds operating. 
NURSE: She's not responding, Doctor. Her synaptic network is breaking
down. 
CRUSHER: Inject norep. 
NURSE: Neurons are beginning to depolarise. 
CRUSHER: Let's go for direct reticular stimulation. 
NURSE: Direct? 
CRUSHER: Do it! (Tasha jerks from the shock) Increase to seventy
microvolts. 
(Tasha moves less this time) 
CRUSHER: Eighty five microvolts. (nothing) Again. (still nothing)
Ninety. Again. Again. She's gone. 
PICARD: Gone? 
CRUSHER: There was too much synaptic damage. That thing just sucked the
life right out of her. There's nothing I can do.
