[Chez Picard]

(Picard is at a desk by the front window. According
to the computer screen, this Atlantis Project is to create a land mass
over the mid-Atlantic ridge.) 
MARIE: Jean Luc? Are you all right? 
PICARD: I seem to have made a rather disturbing discovery. Louis
mentioned the Atlantis project needed a director, and I found myself
actually thinking about it. 
MARIE: Why shouldn't you? 
PICARD: Leaving my career, the Enterprise? 
MARIE: Considering what you've just been through 
PICARD: No, it's not that. Or is it? 
MARIE: Besides, it would be wonderful to have you back home. Given a
little time, maybe you and your brother might even get to like one
another. 
PICARD: Well, I already like his choice in wives. I never thanked you
for your correspondence. It made me feel like part of the family. 
MARIE: You're not like part of the family. You are part of the family,
Jean Luc Picard. 
(The door bell has chimed) 
ROBERT: Don't worry, my dear, I've got it. 
LOUIS: Robert. 
MARIE: Louis, come in. Let me get you some wine. You can talk business.

ROBERT: Business? 
PICARD: Well, there's nothing much to talk about. 
LOUIS: I'm interested to know what you thought about our plans. 
PICARD: I've only had a chance to glance at them. I've a few ideas. 
LOUIS: Wonderful. We should discuss them with the board of governors.
I've set up a meeting. 
PICARD: Meeting? 
LOUIS: Just a preliminary conversation. Tomorrow morning? 
PICARD: Preliminary to what? 
LOUIS: They want you. I mentioned your interest in the project, that's
all. That's all I had to say. They jumped at the prospect. 
PICARD: I never said there was a prospect. 
LOUIS: At least listen to them, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: All right. Very good. Fine. I'll listen. 
LOUIS: You won't regret it, Jean-Luc. I promise you. I'll see you in
the morning. 
[Crusher's office]

WESLEY: I don't understand, Mom. What kind of
message? 
CRUSHER: I don't know exactly. Your father made it a few weeks after
you were born. 
WESLEY: Why? 
CRUSHER: He felt it was important to say certain things. And to make
sure that he didn't forget to tell you later. 
WESLEY: Do you know what it says? 
CRUSHER: No. But he wanted you to have this when you turned eighteen.
And I want you to have it, too.
