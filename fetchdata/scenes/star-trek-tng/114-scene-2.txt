sweet ahh choo stand party sensors actually away bigger

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Sir, we are now twenty minutes from
Omicron Theta, mark! 
RIKER: Stand by for subwarp. Head for standard orbit of Data's planet.
I wonder why Data hasn't come up here.
PICARD: He said he wanted to be alone. Perhaps it's a bigger moment for
him than we thought. 
[Data's Quarters]

DATA: Aah, ahh, ahh 
(Wesley enters) 
WESLEY: Data! 
DATA: Choo! 
WESLEY: What are you doing?
DATA: Sneezing.
WESLEY: Have you got a cold?
DATA: A cold what?
WESLEY: It's a disease my mom says people used to get.
DATA: Ah. But humans still sneeze for other reasons and I cannot seem
to do it right.
WESLEY: How can you be practicing something like sneezing when we're
arriving at your home planet for the first time? Aren't you interested
in that?
DATA: More than interested. Fascinated. One might say agog. But I also
find sneezing interesting. 
WESLEY: Captain Picard wishes to see you on the Bridge. 
[Bridge]

TASHA: Captain, confirming class M reading there.
But the sensors aren't showing any life readings. Not even vegetation.
PICARD: Strange. The cruiser that found Data reported farmlands here.
(Data and Wesley enter) 
RIKER: Do you want to take her into orbit, Data?
DATA: No, thank you, sir.
PICARD: Continue on into close parking orbit.
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
DATA: I could say home sweet home, sir, if I understood how the word
sweet applies.
PICARD: It usually refers to the memories.
RIKER: It usually refers to one's own memories, Captain. Do the
memories you were given include farms, Data?
DATA: Affirmative, sir. But the colony's principal interest was science.
TASHA: Data, I can't understand how you can hold the memories of four
hundred and eleven people. If that means every experience, every day of
their life?
DATA: It does not, unfortunately. It means only the knowledge they had
accumulated. Actually, I am quite deficient in some basic human
information. Sneezing, for example.
PICARD: Sneezing?
LAFORGE: Approaching close parking orbit, sir.
PICARD: Assemble your away party, Commander. This must be an exciting
moment for you, Mister Data. I'm tempted to lead the away team myself,
except that my First Officer would object.
RIKER: How would Starfleet judge me if I didn't? An entire Earth colony
did disappear down there.
PICARD: You see? 
LAFORGE: Now in close parking orbit, sir.
PICARD: Mister Data, welcome home.

First Officer's log, stardate 4124.5. We have found
Data's home to be a completely dead world made out of lifeless
vegetation. No insects, not even soil bacteria. What is it that could
kill everything on an entire planet?
