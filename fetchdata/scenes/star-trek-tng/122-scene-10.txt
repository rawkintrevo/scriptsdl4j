(The team beam down onto a barren rock-strewn
surface under a salmon pink sky. One of the nacelles has broken off the
little shuttlecraft) 
CRUSHER: Let's go. The life signs are weak. 
(Their way is blocked by what seems to be an oil slick) 
RIKER: What is this? 
TASHA: No idea. We'll go around, just to be on the safe side. 
(The slick moves to stay between them and the shuttle) 
TASHA: Let's try the other way. 
(It moves again) 
RIKER: Enterprise, this is Riker. We've got a problem. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: What kind of problem, Number One? 
RIKER [OC]: I'm not sure yet. There appears to be some kind of a slick
blocking our path. Will keep you apprised. 
PICARD: Maintain an open frequency. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. 
DATA: Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is, but I can tell
you what it is not. 
RIKER: Explain. 
DATA: There is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems. No
internal organs. Cellular structure unknown. It does not have any
proteins which are known to us. 
CRUSHER: It's narrower over here. We can get over it. 
RIKER: How is it moving, Data? 
DATA: I do not know, sir. It does not appear to have a skeletal
framework or musculature. 
RIKER: Then what's causing it to move? 
DATA: It appears to be following us, sir. 
RIKER: No sign of intelligence, no brain as we know it, yet evidence of
thought, Mister Data? 
DATA: Insufficient information, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Is it a life form, Data? 
DATA [OC]: Again, insufficient information, sir. 
PICARD: Theorise.
