BEATA TROI LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD RIKER RAMSEY CREWMAN DATA

[Hideout]

TROI: Tasha! 
(Below them is a cave and settlement, and a man at a table) 
RAMSEY: Welcome. I've been expecting you. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Picard to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

(Worf sneezes) 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Status report. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Eighty-two more reported cases of the virus, sir. Doctor
Crusher's converted the holodeck into an isolation ward. 
PICARD: And the away team? 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Well, no recent contact, sir, but I have
informed them of the medical situation up here and the growing Romulan
threat to our Neutral Zone outpost. 
[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Keep me advised. You have the Bridge until
Commander Riker returns. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Engineering reports a computer malf (sneeze)
I'm sorry, I'm getting sick. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure half the ship knows that by now. Report to Sickbay,
Lieutenant. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering to bridge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: The computer won't accept the variant climate controls. 
LAFORGE: On my way. 
WORF: With all respect, Lieutenant, there are people to do that job
now. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Engineering. Lieutenant Wong knows the system. I'm
sure she'll be able to resolve all problems. Worf, thanks for the
advice. 
[Hideout]

RAMSEY: How did you find me? 
DATA: Actually, it was quite simple. Angel One has no platinum.
Enterprise scanners did the rest. 
RAMSEY: Platinum, was it? My wings. I kept them for their sentimental
value. 
TASHA: Where are the other survivors, Mister Ramsey? 
RAMSEY: Oh, they're nearby. They're packing, as a matter of fact, since
we can no longer remain here. 
TROI: Seven years on an alien planet, and I sense no anticipation, no
excitement
at being rescued. 
RAMSEY: What is it that you think you're rescuing me from? My shipmates
and I have all taken wives. A few even have children. You can't rescue
a man from a place that he calls his home. 
[Beata's quarters]

(Beata has slipped into something more comfortable)

RIKER: Why were you so hesitant at first to tell us about the Odin
survivors? 
BEATA: Simply because Ramsey and his men are anarchists. I had to make
sure you weren't here to fuel their struggle. I like the way your eyes
pick up the colour of your tunic. 
RIKER: It's not our position to interfere in the domestic affairs of
other societies. 
BEATA: But you can interact. 
RIKER: Of course. Otherwise, how can we learn? 
BEATA: Is that why you're here with me tonight? To learn? 
RIKER: Yes. 
BEATA: About our society. 
RIKER: Yes. 
BEATA: Well, in our society, it is the men who are the fortunate ones,
enjoying all life has to offer while we women devote ourselves to the
obligation of making life work. 
RIKER: In our society, we share the responsibilities and the pleasures
equally. Which is why I am able to be here with you while the women of
the away team go to find Ramsey. 
BEATA: You'll have to remind me to thank them when they come back for
giving us this time. 
(She kisses him) 
BEATA: You resist. Don't you find me attractive? 
RIKER: Yes, I find you very attractive. 
BEATA: You attract me like no man ever has. 
RIKER: It's not my function to seduce or be seduced by the leader of
another world. 
BEATA: It's not the reason. 
RIKER: No, it's not. But will you still respect me in the morning? 
BEATA: I hope so. 
(They get into a clinch just as Trent enters and hands a gift to Riker)

RIKER: Thank you, Trent. 
BEATA: You may go. 
(Trent leaves reluctantly. Riker opens the gift for Beata) 
RIKER: Compliments of the USS Enterprise. It's called an Albeni
meditation crystal. 
(He touches it with a rod, and it pulses with a yellow glow) 
BEATA: Very impressive. And now I must repay you in kind.
