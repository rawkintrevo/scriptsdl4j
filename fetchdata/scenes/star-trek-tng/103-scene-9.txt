TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

[Tsiolkovsky]

RIKER: As I said, all dead.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are downloading the
research information gathered on the collapsing star nearby. I am
concerned at being in such close orbit, but the Tsiolkovsky's research
records will no doubt predict the time of the star's final collapse.

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: I can't find anything unusual in any of
the tricorder readings they've sent over, Captain. 
PICARD: Give me a theory, Doctor. Anything. Madness? Mass hysteria?
Delusion? 
TROI: Any or all, Captain. 
PICARD: All right. Let's bring the away team back. Set the transporter
to maximum decontamination, and then full examination and observation
when they're here.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: If you were any more perfect, Data, I'd
write you up in a Starfleet medical textbook. 
DATA: I am already listed in several bio-mechanical texts, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Yes of course. You're next, Lieutenant. 
(Geordi lays on the bed) 
CRUSHER: Normal all across. Except, why are you perspiring, Lieutenant?

LAFORGE: I suppose because you have it too hot in here. What else would
it be? 
RIKER: That doesn't sound like you, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe it's not. Maybe she threw her voice. Hey, it was a
joke. 
CRUSHER: Of course, but I would like to run one or two more tests on
you, Lieutenant. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge, 
PICARD: Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: [OC]: I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge to Sickbay until
further notice. 
PICARD: Do we have a problem, Doctor? 
[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: I don't know yet.
