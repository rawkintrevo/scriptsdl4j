TRAVELLER: Our goal will be to create a stable
gateway between our reality and your mother's reality. 
WESLEY: We've tried. We can't stabilise the link. 
TRAVELLER: Of course not. The equations are only the first step. We
will be going beyond mathematics. 
WESLEY: Just tell me what I have to do. 
TRAVELLER: Begin by letting go of your guilt, Wesley. 
WESLEY: It's my fault. I shouldn't have tried 
TRAVELLER: Focus on the present. You will have to be here completely to
help her back. You must open yourself to time and space and the
intricate threads that bind them. Begin entering your warp field
equations. Now close your eyes. See past the numbers. Trust yourself. 
WESLEY: I can't. I can't do it. 
TRAVELLER: When the time comes, you will, Wesley. You will.

and five metres in diameter. 
CRUSHER: It surrounds the ship? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. 
CRUSHER: If there's nothing wrong with me, maybe there's something
wrong with the universe. Computer, what is beyond the mass energy
field? 
COMPUTER: Sensors cannot penetrate the field. 
CRUSHER: Here's a question you shouldn't be able to answer. What is the
nature of the universe? 
COMPUTER: The universe is a spheroid region seven hundred and five
metres in diameter.
