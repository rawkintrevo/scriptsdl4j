LWAXANA: I must admit, when you first approached me
aboard the Enterprise, I was intrigued. 
TOG: You mean revolted. 
LWAXANA: Perhaps a little. Do you forgive me? 
TOG: Yes. With your powers we could be a formidable team. 
(She grabs his hand to stop him removing her dress, but never looks
directly at him) 
LWAXANA: My, you have great strength in your hands. 
TOG: And you like that? 
LWAXANA: I have always admired strong males. 
TOG: You are beautiful. It is impossible for me to resist you. 
LWAXANA: Then don't. 
(They pucker up and fall back on the bed. Troi cringes)

DATA: Initial scans of ionisation patterns
complete, sir. Now correlating sensor readings. 
PICARD: It's almost incomprehensible, the amount of energy being
expended. 
DATA: Actually, it is five point three four times ten to the forty
first watts, sir. Well within the norm for this type of phenomena. 
PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, Data, but that takes away none of the
wonder.

[Holding room]

NIBOR: Check. 
RIKER: I'm sick of this game. 
NIBOR: Of course, now that you're losing. 
RIKER: Who's losing? I'm just tired of standing up. 
NIBOR: You can't resign now. 
RIKER: It's hard to play from in here. I can't even see the whole
board. 
NIBOR: Ah, then you'll finish the game if I let you out of the cell? 
RIKER: I might. 
NIBOR: Clever, human, but I'm not that foolish. 
RIKER: What, do you think I'm going to try to escape? What would that
get me? You've already got her. Besides, where would I go? 
NIBOR: I do not trust you. 
RIKER: Fine. Thanks for the game. 
NIBOR: Come out here. (puts the forcefield back up) Now save your rook,
if you can.
