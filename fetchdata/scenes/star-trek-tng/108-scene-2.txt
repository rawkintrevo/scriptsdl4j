(Back in normal uniform) 
PICARD: But do you understand the basis of all this nonsense between
them? 
RIKER: No sir. I didn't understand that kind of hostility even when I
studied Earth history. 
PICARD: Really? Oh, yes, well these life forms feel such passionate
hatred matters of custom, God concepts, even, strangely enough,
economic systems 
DATA: Sir, my sensors are picking up an unusual energy object ahead. 
PICARD: On screen. 
TASHA: Confirmed, sir. My sensors read nothing solid but considerable
energy in changing patterns. 
DATA: Also travelling at warp speed, sir. Intriguing. I can find no
match with anything in our records, sir. 
PICARD: Change course to make a close sensor pass. We can then increase
warp speed and reach Parliament on schedule. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Sensor Maintenance]

(Geordi and Worf are checking the screens in the
small room) 
LAFORGE: So, Worf, why the interest in this? It's just routine
maintenance on the sensor assemblies. 
WORF: Simple, Geordi. Our Captain wants his junior officers to learn,
learn, learn. 
LAFORGE: Not just the junior ones. Okay, you hold this relay offline
while I adjust these sensor circuits. 
TASHA [OC]: Security to Sensor Maintenance. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant La Forge here.
