RIKER CRUSHER WORF KEHLEYR

[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: One of the Klingons who died in the
explosion was with Duras, the other was with Gowron. I've been
examining the bodies, trying to get a clue to where the bomb was
hidden. There's always a pattern in the lacerations and tissue damage.
It would normally give a clear indication as to the direction,
distance, force of impact. 
RIKER: Normally? 
CRUSHER: In this case, the pattern was virtually impossible to detect.
I couldn't understand it until I looked at the dynoscans. This wound is
different from all of the others. It was made from the inside out. The
bomb was implanted in one of their forearms. 
RIKER: It's considered an honourable way for a Klingon to die, a
suicide that takes an enemy with it. Which one of them was it? 
CRUSHER: Duras' man.

[Corridor]

WORF: When we have more time I will take you to the
holodeck and demonstrate in more detail 
[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(Worf and Alexander enter to find a broken table
and K'Ehleyr lying across a chair. There is blood) 
WORF: Medical emergency, deck eight, room one four two! 
(Worf takes K'Ehleyr in his arms. She is very badly injured and can
barely whisper) 
WORF: Gowron? 
K'EHLEYR: No. 
WORF: Duras! 
K'EHLEYR: Alexander. 
(She puts Alexander's hand into Worf's, then dies) 
WORF: K'Ehleyr. K'Ehleyr! 
(He does the death roar, which frightens Alexander, then lays her on
the floor) 
WORF: You have never seen death. Then look. And always remember. 
(Crusher arrives with an assistant) 
WORF: Stay with the doctor. 
CRUSHER: Worf, when did you 
(But he has already left) 
[Worf's quarters]

(Worf removes his baldric, takes the bat'leth from
the wall. As an afterthought, he takes off his
comm. badge too)
