incubate attempt necessary attempting alive field position precisely sent

[Romulan Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Suggest what the Romulans were doing? 
DATA: They may have been attempting to eject their engine core. 
TROI: I thought I heard one of the Engineers say something about a
power transfer. Something about an energy feedback. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain. It looks to me like they were trying to stop
whatever was happening here. 
PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge 
[Runabout living section]

PICARD: From where you are, can you determine
what's happening on the Romulan Bridge? 
[Romulan Engineering]

LAFORGE: I think so, Captain. Wait. Something's not
right here. Data, was this man always standing right here. 
(the Romulan grabs Geordi, there's an energy flash and they both fall.
Geordi is convulsing) 
TROI: He's in neural shock, 
DATA: We must get him to the runabout. 
TROI: There isn't time. He's dying. 
(she takes Geordi's armband off) 
TROI: At least this way, he'll be alive in the other time frame. We
might have a chance to save him later. Is the Romulan still alive? 
DATA: Yes, but I am getting unusual readings from his bioscan. I am not
sure he is a Romulan.

[Runabout living section]

DATA: His cellular structure does not conform to
any known species. His bioelectric patterns are in a state of temporal
flux. I do not believe that this being is native to our time continuum.

PICARD: Mister Data, you said that you found organic matter in the
temporal aperture. 
DATA: Correct, sir. 
PICARD: I'd like to take a closer look at those readings. 
(Data calls them up on the wall monitor) 
DATA: This is a biospectral analysis of the temporal aperture. The
organic readings originated from these dark spots. 
PICARD: They appear to contain some sort of energy patterns. Can you
isolate one of them and magnify? 
(Data does so) 
PICARD: They look like cellular clusters. 
DATA: Its bioelectric patterns are similar to those of the alien's.
However, they are significantly less complex. Its cellular structure
appears to be in a state of mitosis. 
PICARD: Data, this could be some sort of embryo. 
DATA: It is possible. If I could further scan the aperture, it might be
possible to 
TROI: Captain? 
(the alien is awake) 
ALIEN: Must save. No. 
PICARD: Who are you? 
ALIEN: This body is not mine. It was necessary to assume it to exist in
your time. 
TROI: Why are you here? 
ALIEN: We had to come to save them. They were in danger. 
PICARD: Who were in danger? 
ALIEN: Our young. They will die in the gravity well. It is artificial. 
TROI: Artificial gravity well? Do you mean the Romulan engine core? 
ALIEN: Yes. Our young are trapped. We must get them out, return them to
our time. 
DATA: His molecular structure is destabilising. 
PICARD: How were your young trapped in the core? 
ALIEN: We must use a natural gravity well to incubate our young. We
thought the Romulan core would suffice. It did not. 
DATA: Captain, I believe the aliens mistook the artificial singularity,
which the Romulans use in their engine, for a natural one. A black
hole. They tried to use it as a nest. 
TROI: That's what deactivated the Warbird's engine core. So the
Romulans sent out a distress call. 
PICARD: The Enterprise responded, and found the warbird suffering from
an apparent engine failure, and they attempted a power transfer. 
ALIEN: Power transfer. Must stop the power transfer. Ruptured time,
destroy our young 
DATA: When the power transfer came into contact with the alien nest, I
believe it disrupted the space-time continuum. 
PICARD: Did you who attacked the Enterprise? 
ALIEN: Yes. Had to stop power transfer. 
PICARD: Are there any others like you here? 
ALIEN: One other. 
PICARD: Do you know where he is? Could he help us restore normal time? 
(but the alien vanishes) 
(later) 
DATA: I estimate the core breach will consume the Enterprise in
approximately seven hours, two minutes. 
PICARD: Is it possible to lock onto the core itself, beam it into
space? 
DATA: No, sir. We would have to surround the core with a subspace
isolation field. It is not possible to generate a field of that
magnitude from the runabout. 
PICARD: Mister Data, when you scanned the temporal aperture with your
tricorder, it caused time to move forwards and then back again. 
DATA: Correct, sir. 
PICARD: What if we could reverse that process? Cause time move
backwards and then forwards. 
TROI: We might be able to run time back to a point before the warp core
breach occurred and then find a way to prevent the power transfer. And
then when time goes forward 
PICARD: The breach never happens. 
DATA: I could attempt to remodulate the tricorder's delta-band
emissions. It should be possible to better control the temporal
aperture. 
PICARD: Make it so. If this works, we may not have much time to prevent
the power transfer. We'll have to decide precisely where to be and what
to do the very instant that time begins to move backwards. 
Captain's log, supplemental. After placing the
modified tricorder on the Romulan ship, we have returned to the
Enterprise.

DATA [OC]: I have reached Engineering, Captain.
Standing by. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. Counsellor, are you in position?

[Sickbay]

TROI: Ready, Captain.

[Bridge]

PICARD: All right, Mister Data. 
[Engineering]

DATA: Initiating tricorder emissions.
