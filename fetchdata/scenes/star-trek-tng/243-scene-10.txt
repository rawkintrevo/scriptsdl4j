[Meeting hall]

(At the communal evening meal) 
GUEST0: Aren't you hungry, L'Kor? Or are you upset because your
prisoner has not returned? 
L'KOR: I should not have sent the boy with him. If he has been hurt 
GUEST0: Don't worry, my friend. They'll come back. After all, a warrior
keeps his word. Isn't that so? 
BA'EL: Father if I wanted to visit Romulus, or the Klingon Home world,
would I be allowed to go? 
(Toq enters carrying a dead quadruped, skinned and gutted) 
GUEST5: Ka'la! Tonight, we eat well. 
GUEST0: Get that off my table. 
GUEST5: You do not kill an animal unless you intend to eat it. 
GUEST0: Get rid of it. 
GUEST5: I intend to, Tokath. But not until it's cooked. Today I learned
the ritual hunt. But that is not all I learned. I discovered that
warrior's blood runs in my veins. I do not know how or why, but we have
forgotten ourselves. Our stories are not told, our songs are not sung.
Tonight, as we came home, we sang a song of victory. A song known only
to me as a lullaby. But it is a warrior's song. Bagh Da tuHmoh. Fire
streaks the heavens. ChojaH Duh rHo. Battle has begun. Bagh Da tuHmoh.
ChojaH Duh rHo. ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo. 
(others join in and I cannot be bothered to try and transcribe it all.)

GUEST0: Ba'el. 
ALL: Ylja'Qo ylja'Qo! ylja'Qo!! 
(later, when the rest of the people have left) 
GUEST0: Well, Worf, you've had quite an effect on the young people. 
WORF: I have done nothing more than show them what they are. 
GUEST0: No. You have shown them what you want them to be. Tell me this.
Do you know of any place, any time in history, when Klingons and
Romulans have lived together in peace? We have despised each other,
fought each other, for centuries. Except here, on this remote planet,
Romulans and Klingons live together in harmony. No government, no
leader, has ever done what I have done here. 
WORF: And what about Toq? I saw what happened to him when he caught the
scent of his prey on the wind. For the first time in his life, he felt
powerful, and that is what he has been denied living here. And that is
what you have tried to take away from him. Now you may be content to
sit here in the jungle and wither to old age, but Toq and the others
have tasted what it is to feel truly alive, and they will not give that
up now. 
GUEST0: Enough of this. We could talk all night and not convince each
other. I offer you a choice. Live with us as one of us 
WORF: Or? 
GUEST0: Or I will have you put to death. 
WORF: Then that is what you will have to do. 
GUEST0: Worf, consider this carefully. 
WORF: That death will be honourable. The young people will see what it
is to die as a Klingon.
