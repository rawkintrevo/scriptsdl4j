[Wesley's room]

LEDA: Will you at least eat? 
(She puts the tray on the table and leaves) 
WESLEY: No, Alexandra. 
ALEXANDRA: Why? 
WESLEY: We can't eat. I know you're hungry. We all are. But it's our
way of telling them that we want to go home. Understand? 
ALEXANDRA: Yes. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and Data get on the pads) 
RIKER: We're ready, Lieutenant Worf. 
[Bridge]

RADUE [on viewscreen]: Captain, you may come down
now to conclude our discussions, or your ship may leave. It's your
choice. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude our negotiations.

(They are beamed away) 
WORF: Transporter room, now!

[Aldean corridor]

(Data and Riker arrive safely and head off into) 
[Custodian room]

DATA: This is it, Commander. It is programmed to
accept only authorised voice command. 
RIKER: There's no way we can override. 
DATA: No, but I can scramble the input so that nobody else can. 
[First Unit]

RADUE: Before we begin, Captain, you must speak
with the children. It seems they are on some sort of strike. I don't
understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm not very good with
children. 
PICARD: Strike? I'll see what I can do.
