RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY DUFFY DATA BARCLAY

[Engineering]

BARCLAY: It's the injectors. 
LAFORGE: Override. 
BARCLAY: It's not a computer problem. The mechanism is physically
jammed. I can't clear it. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Speed increasing, sir. Warp seven point six,
seven point six five. Warp seven point seven. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We can't shut it down, Captain. Antimatter
flow is increasing. She's accelerating out of control.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: There's nothing I can do. 
WORF: Approaching warp nine sir. 
PICARD: Red alert. 
RIKER: Estimated time to structural failure. 
DATA: At this rate of acceleration, fifteen minutes forty seconds, sir.

RIKER: Did you copy that, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, Commander. 
RIKER: Recommendations.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I'll let you know as soon as we have some.
La Forge out. Okay, this ship is going to start tearing itself apart in
fifteen minutes. I want every idea on the table. I don't care how
outrageous. 
DUFFY: What about attempting a magnetic quench on the fusion
pre-burners? 
LAFORGE: No, I already tried that. The magnetic fields won't reset. 
WESLEY: Could the fuel inlet servos be caught in cycle? 
LAFORGE: If they were, the swirl dampers would be frozen too and they
aren't. 
DUFFY: Nothing showed up in the diagnostic sweep at all? 
BARCLAY: The tests showed there were problems, I mean no problems with
the flow, the flow of the. 
LAFORGE: There's nothing wrong with the computer control protocols or
the power transfer systems. As far as we can determine, the injectors
are just physically jammed. 
DUFFY: Injectors freeze, anti-grav unit goes down, and transporter
malfunctions. 
WESLEY: And a twisted glass. 
LAFORGE: What's the connection?

[Bridge]

WORF: Exceeding warp nine point four. 
PICARD: Begin evacuation of secondary hull. Prepare for emergency
saucer separation. 
WORF: Standing by to release docking clamps. 
RIKER: Reroute systems to primary hull power sources. 
DATA: The plasma flow to the nacelles is uneven due to injector lock.
An emergency saucer separation could rupture the warp field. 
(The ship shakes under the stress) 
DATA: Twelve minutes to structural failure, sir.
