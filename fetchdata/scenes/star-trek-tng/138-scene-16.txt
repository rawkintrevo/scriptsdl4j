RIKER: Well, this is what we came here for.
Captain, we're entering.

[Lobby]

(Worf leads the way into a very elegant foyer and
lobby in a Middle Eastern style. Lots of marble and palm plants, very
twenties or thirties. We hear the laughter of people having a good time
at blackjack tables) 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Enterprise to away team, come in. 
LAFORGE: We're receiving no signal at all from them, sir. 
PICARD: Transporter room. lock on to the landing party. Beam them up. 
LAFORGE: We've got nothing to lock on to, sir. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. We've entered the
structure. Riker to Enterprise, come in. Come in, Enterprise. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: When they went through that antique
doorway, the signal just disappeared, sir.
PICARD: What's causing the interference? 
LAFORGE: Unknown. 
PICARD: Are they receiving us? 
LAFORGE: No. We're going to have to recalibrate all the frequencies to
find one that'll work. 
PICARD: Then do it.

[Lobby]

DATA: Sir, without communication, we should beam up
immediately. 
RIKER: We're here, there's no danger. We'll look around then leave. 
BELLBOY: Checking in, gentlemen? You'll have to go to the front desk. 
RIKER: Very good. We'll start with that. 
CLERK: Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice trip? 
RIKER: Do you know us? 
CLERK: We've been expecting you. A trio of foreign gentlemen. 
RIKER: Yes. We're from the United Federation of Planets. 
CLERK: Of course you are. Welcome to the Hotel Royale 
BELLBOY: Excuse me. Did Rita call? 
CLERK: I'm busy. 
BELLBOY: You're busy? This is my life I'm talking about here. Now did
Rita call or not? 
CLERK: No, and for your own good you'd better quit thinking about Rita.

BELLBOY: I'm not afraid of Mickey D. 
CLERK: Then you're a fool. Anybody with any sense is afraid of Mickey
D. 
BELLBOY: If Rita calls, you let me know. 
(Bellboy leaves) 
CLERK: Kid's just asking for trouble. Rita's too much for him to
handle, and Mickey D's going to plant
his face in the pavement. Now, here are your room keys. And some
complimentary casino chips. Enjoy. 
WORF: What is this place? How did a being like you get here? 
CLERK: Why, this is the Royale, of course. And my personal life is
really none of your business, thank you. 
RIKER: What he means is, what planet is this? 
CLERK: I beg your pardon? 
RIKER: This planet. What do you call it? 
CLERK: Earth. What do you call it? 
WORF: We call it Theta Eight. 
CLERK: How charming. 
(The manager returns to putting mail into pigeon holes, so the team
take a stroll amongst the tables) 
DATA: Commander 
RIKER: Yes, Data? 
DATA: None of these people are emitting life signs. 
WORF: You mean they're not alive? 
RIKER: Then what are they? 
WORF: These beings, are they machines, or mere illusions designed to
deceive us? 
DATA: Not illusion, Lieutenant. They do exist, but they do not register
as either man or machine. 
DATA: Take this creature, for example. He does not exhibit any DNA
structure. 
TEXAS: Excuse me, son. Look who's talking. Man, you sound just like my
ex-wife. All right. Time to get back to business! 
DATA: What sort of business do you suppose he is getting down to?

[Bridge]

PICARD: Status report. 
WESLEY: We're attempting to employ alternate encoding schemes. 
LAFORGE: There could be hundreds of possible combinations. 
PICARD: Is there an intelligence causing this interference? 
LAFORGE: That's impossible to tell, Captain. 
PICARD: It's unlike Commander Riker not to follow procedure. When he
lost contact with the Enterprise, he should have returned immediately
to the beam down coordinates. 
TROI: I don't feel he's in any danger. In fact, if I could choose one
word to assess his mood, it would be amused. 
PICARD: Amused?
