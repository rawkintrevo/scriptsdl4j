Captain's log, stardate 41416.2. We're orbiting
Relva Seven, where Wesley Crusher is about to be tested for entrance
into Starfleet Academy. And to my great surprise, I have just learned
that my old friend Admiral Gregory Quinn is on Relva Seven, and has
requested to be beamed aboard the Enterprise immediately. 
[Transporter room]

(Immediately after Wesley is beamed down, Quinn and
Remmick are beamed aboard. Quinn is old, silver-haired. Remmick is
probably thirties, high forehead) 
PICARD: Welcome aboard, Admiral. 
QUINN: Thank you. Captain Jean Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Dexter
Remmick. 
REMMICK: Sir. 
PICARD: Allow me to introduce my staff. First Officer William Riker,
Chief Medical Officer Beverly Crusher, Chief of Security, Natasha Yar.
Well, what can we do for you? 
QUINN: I need to speak with you. 
PICARD: Certainly. This way. Number One? 
QUINN: Alone. 
PICARD: Is this a personal matter? 
QUINN: Official business. 
PICARD: Well then my First Officer 
QUINN: Alone, Captain.
