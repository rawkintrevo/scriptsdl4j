RIKER CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Observation Lounge]

(Data is painting an image on glass) 
LAFORGE: Well, what do you think? 
RIKER: Tell me what it's supposed to be, then I'll give you my opinion.

DATA: It is an attempt at pure creativity. 
LAFORGE: What we're investigating is, can Data be creative? 
DATA: And this is my attempt, with guidance from Geordi. 
LAFORGE: I suggested the zylo eggs. 
RIKER: Is that what those are? 
RIKER: Keep notes. This project might turn out to be of interest to
scholars in the future. 
LAFORGE: Really? 
RIKER: Well of course. Think about it. A blind man teaching an android
how to paint? That's got to be worth a couple of pages in somebody's
book.

RIKER: You look like you're packing to leave
forever. 
CRUSHER: Oh, Commander Riker. No, I'm just gathering my notes.
Professor Terence Epstein is at this starbase. 
RIKER: Is that someone I should know of? 
CRUSHER: He's the leading mind in cybernetics. He lectured at my
medical school. You know the disaster at Micromius? 
[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Well, since then I've been working on an
approach that combines cybernetics and regeneration. It sounds
impossible, I know, but I have found an approach which will work. I
mean, what an opportunity. To have a chance to talk with Doctor
Epstein. Sorry, Will, I'd love to chat, but I have to go.
