PICARD RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE KAZAGO

[Bridge]

RIKER: Open hailing frequencies, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Open, sir. 
RIKER: I'll take it in the Ready room. Secure channel, La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Secure, Sir.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Starship Ferengi, this is Commander Riker
here. I'd like to speak to First Officer Kazago. 
KAZAGO [OC]: A problem, Riker? 
RIKER: Are our channels secure on your end? 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: It is now. 
RIKER: Are you aware of the details of the Battle of Maxia? 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: Captain Bok has just made me aware of it, Riker.
The infamy of your Picard is now fully known. 
RIKER: Infamy? 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: I would call the wanton destruction of an unarmed
vessel infamy. 
RIKER: And if I produced evidence that Captain Picard's log entry was
falsified to indicate that? 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: I can hardly imagine you contacted me to discuss
an ancient battle. What do you want of me? 
RIKER: Just one question. 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: As you humans say, I'm all ears. 
RIKER: First Officer to First Officer, Kazago, if your Captain Bok knew
about this, then why this peaceful meeting to present us with the
Stargazer? 
KAZAGO [on monitor]: We freely give you back your derelict warship and
now you accuse us of crime, Riker? I can bear no more insults!

[Picard's quarters]

(the doorbell chimes) 
PICARD: Yes? Who the hell is it? 
(Crusher enters.) 
CRUSHER: Not resting, Captain? 
PICARD: More like dying, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Over here. 
PICARD: What is wrong with me? 
CRUSHER: I wish to hell I knew, Captain, but something unusual has
definitely been happening to you. 
PICARD: Why do doctors always say the obvious as though it's a
revelation? 
CRUSHER: Why do captains always act like they're immortal? 
(she tries another painkiller) 
PICARD: No.
