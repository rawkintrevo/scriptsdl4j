CREWMAN CRUSHER RUSSELL WORF
attempt checking welcome brilliant medlab active approval injury really

[Sickbay]

WORF: What happened? 
CRUSHER: The containers you were checking fell on you. You're lucky to
be alive. 
(Worf tries to sit up, but cannot) 
WORF: Doctor, I will not attempt to leave Sickbay without your
approval. The restraining field is not necessary. 
CRUSHER: Worf, there is no restraining field. 
WORF: But I can't move my legs. 
CRUSHER: I know. You can't move because one of the containers shattered
seven of your vertebrae and crushed your spinal cord. I'm afraid
there's no way we can repair this kind of injury.

Captain's log, stardate 45587.3. Lieutenant Worf
has been removed from active duty following a severe injury. Although a
neuro-specialist has arrived, Doctor Crusher believes his paralysis may
be permanent.

Think Hillary Clinton) 
CRUSHER: Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly
Crusher. 
RUSSELL: A pleasure. I have some equipment aboard the Potemkin. Would
you please have it sent to one of your medical labs. 
CRUSHER: Of course. Send it to medlab four. 
CREWMAN: Yes, Doctor. 
RUSSELL: Before we get down to business, I just wanted to say that I
had the pleasure of reading your paper on cybernetic regeneration
recently. 
CRUSHER: Really? You're the first person to mention it. 
RUSSELL: I thought it was brilliant.
