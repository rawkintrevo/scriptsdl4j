[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is listening to the 3rd Brandenburg with an
unfamiliar instrument in it, when the doorbell chimes) 
PICARD: Computer, pause playback. Come. Oh, Commander Daren. 
NELLA: I hope you don't mind me dropping by like this? 
PICARD: No, please, come in. I'm delighted. 
NELLA: What kind of flute is that? 
PICARD: It's Ressikan. 
NELLA: I've never saw one before. 
PICARD: They're not made anymore. 
NELLA: Have you been playing long? 
PICARD: Er, yes, a long time. 
NELLA: I'd love to hear you play sometime. 
PICARD: I'm not very good. 
NELLA: That doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. 
PICARD: Yes, but I wouldn't want to inflict it on someone else. 
NELLA: May I try? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. Yes, you're not holding it quite right. May I? 
NELLA: Please. 
(Picard plays one of his plaintive melodies) 
NELLA: You're better than you think. Really. We should play together. 
PICARD: There isn't a piano. 
NELLA: Ah, but there is. 
(she unrolls a keyboard on the coffee table) 
NELLA: I picked it up on Mataline Two. It's amazing. 
(a quick grand piano arpeggio) 
PICARD: That is remarkable. Why don't you play something? 
NELLA: You start and I'll jump in. 
PICARD: What shall we play? 
NELLA: What were you working on before I came in? 
PICARD: Bach, the third Brandenburg. 
NELLA: Perfect. Go ahead. 
(Picard starts, but gets lost when she joins in) 
PICARD: I'm sorry. 
NELLA: It's all right. You're not used to playing with anyone, are you?

PICARD: Just the computer. 
NELLA: I may not be as precise as a computer, but I think you'll enjoy
it more. Why don't we start with something a little simpler. How about?

(she plays Frere Jacque and they do the roundel) 
NELLA: Good. Very good. Now let's have a little fun with it. 
(she plays it with minor variations, and Picard's eyes pop) 
NELLA: You try it. Improvise around the melody. Anything you want. 
(he does) 
NELLA: That's wonderful. Keep going. It's so good. 
(they play it though) 
NELLA: You're definitely better than you think. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, my fencing partner's cancelled
for this afternoon. I was wondering if you wanted to join me? 
RIKER: Fencing? I'm really not very good. 
PICARD: It doesn't matter so as long as you enjoy it. 
RIKER: Why not? 
PICARD: Good. Excellent. Fourteen hundred hours, then.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: You have a mild strain. 
NELLA: I've been playing the piano a lot. I guess the Captain and I
overdid it a little last night. 
CRUSHER: The Captain? 
NELLA: Yes, he plays a kind of flute. A Ressikan, I think he said. 
CRUSHER: Yes, but I didn't know he played duets. 
NELLA: He never did before. He seemed to enjoy it. He's actually quite
promising. 
CRUSHER: I see. 
NELLA: Tell me, have you known him long? 
CRUSHER: Yes, a very long time. 
NELLA: He seems somewhat isolated. 
CRUSHER: I'd say he's a very private person, but not isolated. There,
that should help. 
NELLA: That feels much better. Thank you. 
CRUSHER: Good. 
NELLA: I was afraid I might have to cancel. 
CRUSHER: Another duet?
