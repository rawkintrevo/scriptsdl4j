[Crusher's office]

WORF: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, good. Come in. Please sit down. We have finally
found a compatible ribosome match for the Romulan. But only one. You. 
WORF: That is impossible. I am a Klingon. 
CRUSHER: Different species, yes. But many humanoids have comparable
cell structures. And you have what this Romulan needs. There's
absolutely no risk to you. You did understand that was the purpose of
all the testing? 
WORF: I have no objection to tests. 
CRUSHER: You have an objection to being a donor? 
WORF: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, I understand your feelings about the Romulans, but
this is not the time or place. 
WORF: If you had seen them kill your parents, you would understand,
Doctor, it is always the time and place for those feelings. 
CRUSHER: This Romulan didn't murder your parents. And you are the only
one who can save his life. 
WORF: Then he will die.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: I sure wish you'd put that away. 
BOCHRA: You're afraid of dying. 
LAFORGE: You bet I am. Who isn't? 
BOCHRA: I'm not. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
BOCHRA: To die in the service of my people. 
LAFORGE: Ah, the Romulan path to glory. 
BOCHRA: You can be sarcastic now, but in a few millennia, when humans
are extinct and the Romulan Empire spans the galaxy. 
LAFORGE: You really believe that stuff, don't you, Commodore? 
BOCHRA: You may address me as Centurion Bochra. 
LAFORGE: Bochra? Good, solid Romulan name. What's the matter? 
BOCHRA: Nothing. 
LAFORGE: Wrong. Your heart rate just shot way up. (taps the Visor) It
translates a wide range of radiation into neural impulses. Allows me to
see. 
BOCHRA: Without it, you're blind? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
BOCHRA: How did this happen? 
LAFORGE: I was born that way. 
BOCHRA: And your parents let you live? 
LAFORGE: What kind of question is that? Of course they let me live. 
BOCHRA: No wonder your race is weak. You waste time and resources on
defective children. 
LAFORGE: Whoa. I must be having some sort of polarity shift. The
diagnostic insists everything's fine. Hey, hey, your body temperature's
gone up another full point. 
BOCHRA: What are you saying? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. It must be this place, all that electromagnetic
soup, it's wreaking havoc on our nervous systems. Your metabolism's
messed up, so's my interface with the Visor. We've got to get out of
here while we still can. 
BOCHRA: Sit down. 
LAFORGE: Bochra 
BOCHRA: Sit down!

[Bridge]

(Riker is hanging over Wesley's shoulder) 
RIKER: What is that? 
WESLEY: It's just a background fluctuation, Commander. He hasn't found
it yet. 
RIKER: Then he must be hurt or dead. When does our next window open up,
Mister Data? 
DATA: There is no indication, Commander. I have no way to predict. 
WORF: Incoming Romulan transmission, Captain. 
RIKER: They're early. 
DATA: The Romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away from
the edge of the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Close enough, however, to see we're not there. On screen. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Picard, I'm approaching the Federation border
and the Enterprise is not to be found. Why? 
PICARD: My away team is unable to leave the surface because of the
storms. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And my officer? 
PICARD: He is alive. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: His life remains in jeopardy? 
PICARD: Yes. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And yet you will still not permit me to cross
into your precious Federation space to retrieve him? 
PICARD: If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me make
it again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless they
are prepared to do battle. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: But a mission of mercy? 
PICARD: A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caught
on a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I have already explained. 
PICARD: And I have rejected your explanation. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Territories! You would measure territories
against a man's life? 
PICARD: Commander, I am singularly impressed by your concern for a
life. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picard
out.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Bochra. Bochra, you're in bad shape and my
vision's getting worse. Now there's a beacon out there that'll get us
back to my ship, but not if I can't find it. 
BOCHRA: I cannot surrender to the Federation. 
LAFORGE: Then stay here and die. 
BOCHRA: If the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid
capture? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I might, if I thought it was necessary. If the
stakes were high enough. But they'd have to be pretty damn high. I
guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan, huh? 
BOCHRA: I no more wish to die than you do. 
LAFORGE: Bochra, there are times when it is necessary to die for one's
ideals. Do you believe this is one of those times? 
(Bochra puts down the phaser) 
LAFORGE: Come on. Let's go find that beacon. Whoa! 
BOCHRA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: Everything's gone blank. I'm blind.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come. Worf. 
WORF: You are busy. Forgive my intrusion. 
RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. 
WORF: With respect, sir, you cannot. I am asked to give up the very
lifeblood of my mother and my father to those who murdered them. 
RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? 
WORF: Yes. 
RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with the
Romulans. 
WORF: Impossible. 
RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Think
how many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here now
like this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame?
Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carry
the bitterness on another generation? 
WORF: Then you believe I should? 
RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. 
WORF: My Starfleet training tells me one thing, but everything I am
tells me another. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. 
WORF: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end.
I thought it important for you to see him again. It's not too late to
change your mind. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PATAHK: Come close to me, Klingon. Let me die with my hands at your
throat. 
WORF: There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive. 
PATAHK: Then you've come to hear me beg for my life? 
WORF: No. 
PATAHK: I would rather die than pollute my body with Klingon filth!
