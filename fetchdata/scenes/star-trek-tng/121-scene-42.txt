beautiful correct ve weapon stop commander looking tragedy encounter

[Cavern]

(Picard and Crusher are far enough apart to be out
of sight of each other, but not earshot) 
PICARD: We seem to be pretty well sealed in, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: No exits? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
CRUSHER: If you find one, go. 
PICARD: Tired of my company already? Beverly. Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm tired. I need to sleep. Woke up too early. 
PICARD: Talk to me, stay awake. Tell me something. Tell me about those
roots. How did you know their medicinal values? 
CRUSHER: My grandmother. 
PICARD: Your grandmother was a doctor? 
CRUSHER: No. 
PICARD: Oh. She was a botanist, then? 
CRUSHER: No. She helped to colonise Arveda Three. 
PICARD: Arveda Three? That's such a tragedy. Did she survive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Once the medical supplies had run out, she had to use
what was at hand. So she learned all about roots and herbs, and then
taught it to me. 
PICARD: You were part of that colony. I didn't know that. But then
there must be a lot of things about you that I don't know. 
CRUSHER: Quite a few. 
PICARD: What? Now just a minute. Here's something odd. It's glowing. 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
PICARD: I don't know. It's covered up. I'm just clearing away the dirt.
It's a viewscreen. It seems to still be operative. 
(He presses a button and the whole wall lights up) 
PICARD: It's a tracking device of some kind. 
CRUSHER: Tracking what? 
PICARD: There are three moving indicators. Possibly the away team. 
SALESMAN: Beautiful, isn't it? It's the centrepiece of the whole unit. 
CRUSHER: Who's that? 
PICARD: A projection. It's the automated salesman who greeted us on the
Enterprise. What unit? 
SALESMAN: Why, the Echo Papa Six Oh Seven. Our proudest achievement.
The ultimate in weapons system technology. 
PICARD: Is that what's behind the attack on my people? 
SALESMAN: Impressive demonstration, isn't it? 
PICARD: Demonstration? It tried to kill us. 
SALESMAN: Versatile, powerful, and easy to use. The Six Oh Seven does
it all. Its various modules can gather information, neutralise ground
personnel, even destroy enemy space vessels. 
PICARD: The Enterprise. Is one of those things after my ship? Tell me. 
SALESMAN: Of course I can tell you. I am programmed to answer any and
all questions about the unit. I can talk terms, arrange for delivery,
whatever you need. 
CRUSHER: It doesn't understand anything other than what it's peddling. 
SALESMAN: The Six Oh Seven represents the state of the art in dynamic,
adaptive design. It learns from each encounter, and improves itself. 
PICARD: So what went wrong? Where are it's creators? Where are the
people of Minos? 
SALESMAN: Once unleashed, the unit is invincible. The perfect killing
system.
PICARD: Too perfect. You poor fools, your own creation destroyed you.
What was that noise? 
SALESMAN: The unit has analysed its last attack and constructed a new,
stronger, deadlier weapon. In a moment, it will launch that weapon
against the targets on the surface. 
PICARD: Abort it! 
SALESMAN: Why would I want to do that? It can't demonstrate its
abilities unless we let it leave the nest. 
[Planet surface]

DATA: They are down there, sir. 
RIKER: Let's clear some of that away. 
TASHA: If Data's calculations are correct, the next one should show
itself in two minutes. 
RIKER: Captain! 
[Cavern]

RIKER [OC]: Can you hear me? 
PICARD: Yes, we're here! 
RIKER: Are you all right? 
(The away team are looking down through the hole at Crusher) 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher is seriously hurt. We can't contact the
Enterprise. The communicators are out. 
RIKER: Yes, our communicators are out too. 
PICARD: Those devices are part of a system located down here. Another
one is about to be released. Watch yourselves. 
TASHA: We know, Captain. 
RIKER: It's too far down there. There's nothing to hold on to. No way
to climb down. 
[Planet surface]

TASHA: I'm surprised either of them survived. 
DATA: I can do it, Commander. 
RIKER: How? 
DATA: Jump. 
RIKER: Data, it's over ten metres. 
DATA: Eleven point seven five, sir. 
TASHA: Data, you may be sturdy, but you're not indestructible. 
DATA: I believe I can safely traverse the distance. 
RIKER: Captain, Data's going down to join you down there. Be my guest.

[Cavern]

(Data lands easily next to Beverly) 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: At your service, Captain.

[Planet Surface]

TASHA: We'd better find a defensive position. If
Data's right 
RIKER: He usually is. 
TASHA: We're going to have company any minute now, and this time I
don't know how we're going to stop it.

Ship's log, supplemental. Lieutenant La Forge in
command of the star drive section. After separating from the saucer, we
have returned to Minos to rescue the away team. Unfortunately, I have
only one option left, and it's a long shot. 
[Battle Bridge]

T'SU: Shields and deflectors are up. 
LAFORGE: Ensign T'Su, when I order the shields down, you have one
responsibility. Locate the away team and get them up here. You may only
have a few seconds. 
SOLIS: Approaching the planet, sir. 
LAFORGE: Ride's going to get a little bumpy. Things are going to happen
fast. Just keep alert, stay calm. Let's focus on what we're doing. You
know your jobs. You've been trained, you've been tested. You've earned
the right to sit in those chairs.
