TROI: Captain, Kate knew what she was doing. 
PICARD: I wish I could be certain that we'd tried everything.
WORF: Commander Data is ready to come aboard, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
[Transporter room]

CREWMAN: No life forms present. 
O'BRIEN: You may step down, sir. 
PICARD: Data, tell me if. It's good to see you again. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Now, quickly. If the changes in Doctor Pulaski's DNA were
reversed, would it be possible 
DATA: It is not reversible, sir. The subtle molecular transposition of 
PICARD: Yes, yes, yes. But say if it were undone, would she be normal
again? 
DATA: As normal as ever, sir. 
PICARD: You said that the transporter could be modified to filter out
the changes in Doctor Pulaski? 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir, but we were unable to locate her trace pattern. 
PICARD: Well, what if we used a sample of her DNA, say from a blood
test taken before she was exposed to the disease? Could that be used to
filter out the genetic changes? 
O'BRIEN: Well, I'd have to get into the biofilter bus to patch in a
molecular matrix reader. That's no problem. But the waveform modulator
will be overloaded without the regeneration limiter in the first stage
circuit. 
DATA: Interesting. However, theoretically, 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Can you do the modifications? 
O'BRIEN: I think so, sir. 
PICARD: Then make it so. 
O'BRIEN: You heard what he said. Let's get those panels off. 
[Doctor's office]

RIKER: A blood test, a tissue sample, anything that
would have a sample of Doctor Pulaski's original DNA. 
DATA: No, sir. Her records were shipped by way of Starfleet
headquarters. They have not caught up with us yet. 
RIKER: This is ridiculous. A cell, a single cell. Let's check her
quarters. 
[Pulaski's quarters]

RIKER: Anything. A fingernail, a hair. 
DATA: Hair brush. 
(Which for some reason she keeps at the back of a clothes drawer) 
DATA: It has a follicle, sir. Live cells.

PICARD: Darwin Station, this is the Enterprise. 
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: Go ahead, Captain. I'm here. 
PICARD: Doctor, we may have a solution. We have a sample of your normal
DNA to use as a filter in the transporter. We think that we can beam
you aboard while filtering out any of the genetic problems caused by
the disease. 
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: Interesting theory, Captain. If it works, we
could use the same technique to save Doctor Kingsley and her
colleagues. 
PICARD: I think you should know, this has never been attempted before. 
PULASKI [on viewscreen]: Well, I'll tell you one thing. If I live
through this, I'll have a much better understanding of geriatrics.

[Transporter room]

(La Forge and Data are assisting O'Brien and his
crewman with the modifications) 
PICARD: All set, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: Almost ready, sir. There's just one thing. 
PICARD: Yes? 
O'BRIEN: This modification's one way only. If it doesn't work we won't
be able to reverse transport the Doctor back to the planet. 
PICARD: Then I'll operate the transporter controls myself. If she's
going to be consigned to oblivion, then 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. I'll be monitoring the medical scans. But
you'll be able to tell if it's worked by watching the stack. 
PICARD: Doctor Pulaski, are you ready? 
PULASKI [OC]: I suppose I am, Captain. 
PICARD: Here we go. 
(The figure that starts to materialise is white-haired and old) 
PICARD: It's not working. 
O'BRIEN: Captain, wait. 
(He taps his board and she becomes younger, and solid. Picard and
Pulaski embrace.) 
DATA: Doctor. 
LAFORGE: Good to see you, Doctor. 
PICARD: Welcome back, Doctor. Come. 
[Corridor]

PULASKI: Captain, if this hadn't worked? 
PICARD: If this hadn't worked, it would have been necessary to beam
your energy into empty space. 
PULASKI: And spread my atoms spread across the galaxy. 
PICARD: Yes. I'm sorry. 
PULASKI: No, no, don't be sorry. Every time I get into the damn thing,
I'm convinced that's what's going to happen.

Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. The
adults of Darwin Station have been restored to normal health using our
transporter. They will remain on Gagarin Four and continue their
research in hopes of one day rejoining their children.
