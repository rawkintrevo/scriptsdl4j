TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI DATA

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The pull on the Enterprise is steady. I'm
having to hold the warp engines at thirty percent in order to maintain
our present position. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Transfer Engine control to the Bridge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: On my way, Captain. 
TROI: Captain, there is a consciousness here. Not thought, more like
instinct. 
PICARD: What do you think, Number One? 
RIKER: I think we're being probed. 
DATA: The beam is coming from the centre of the vortex. Sensors show it
to be only a mass of energy. 
PICARD: What is it trying to learn? 
TROI: I think it's trying to determine if we are a life force. 
PICARD: We'll stay and investigate. 
RIKER: Agreed. 
PICARD: Unless that was the mistake. Staying too long. 
RIKER: Possibly. 
PICARD: We should go now. 
RIKER: Well 
PICARD: That would be the prudent move. I never thought I'd hear myself
saying something like that. 
RIKER: Under the circumstances, sir, I think you're right. 
PICARD: But you would rather stay and find out what it is? What is its
intent? 
LAFORGE: Engineering, transfer to Bridge. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Sir. 
PICARD: Try and take us out of here. Maximum warp. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. I've set the velocity at warp nine. 
PICARD: Engage. 
LAFORGE: Warp engines are at ninety one percent. 
PICARD: Put it to the wall, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(The ship shakes, but they're not actually going anywhere) 
LAFORGE: I can't hold it. 
RIKER: Captain, the engines can't handle the strain. 
PICARD: All stop. 
(The Enterprise slides gently backwards into the top of the funnel) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: I'm re-engaging warp engines, Captain. 
PICARD: Status? 
WORF: All decks have reported. No damage. No injuries. 
LAFORGE: Captain, the hold on the Enterprise is still very strong. I'm
having to hold at warp seven just to maintain our position. 
PICARD: Everything we do tightens its grip. Let's see what we can
learn. Launch a Class one probe. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(The probe is intercepted by an energy bolt and destroyed) 
PICARD: Mister Worf 
(Picard gets zapped by an energy bolt, and so does his counterpart in
Sickbay) 
PICARD: That was personal. 
LAFORGE: Captain, the power drain needed to hold this position is
enormous. 
PICARD: How long can you maintain it? 
LAFORGE: Just a few minutes and then we're going to have to shut down
again. 
PULASKI [OC]: Captain some kind of energy 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Just surrounded my patient. 
PICARD [OC]: Is he still alive? 
PULASKI: Yes 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Arm the photons, Mister Worf. Lock on the
centre of the vortex. 
WORF: Photon torpedoes locked on target. 
PICARD: Hold for my order. 
(Picard gets zapped again and thrown against a bulkhead) 
RIKER: Like a rag in a dog's mouth. 
LAFORGE: I am now at maximum warp. 
TROI: It's you, Captain. It was the entire ship, but now it has focused
its attention entirely on you. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I can't hold it any longer. If we don't shut down
right now, we are going 
PICARD: Hold this position. Counsellor, if I were to leave the
Enterprise, would its attention still be focused on me? 
TROI: Yes. I think it would. 
RIKER: You'd never survive. 
PICARD: But in those few seconds, the Enterprise might break free.
That's what he, that's what the other Picard must have thought. 
RIKER: Captain, where are you going? 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: You're leaving the ship? 
PICARD: We may be on a road that has no turns.
