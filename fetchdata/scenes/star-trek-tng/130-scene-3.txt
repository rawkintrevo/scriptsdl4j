OKONA: Now, that's sex appeal. 
DATA: Sexual attraction in this context is not a part of my
programming. I am an android. 
OKONA: Well, then. Have you seen any good looking computers lately?
That's a joke. It's funny. 
DATA: Ah. Of course it is.

OKONA: Will that do what the original did? 
LAFORGE: Sure will, and better. Let me show you. On your old one, the
zelebium contacts that wore down and then fused. What I've done is
replace them with tricellite. 
OKONA: Tricellite isn't available in this system. If I ever had to
replace it. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry, you won't. Your ship will never outlast this
part. 
OKONA: Because of the part or the way I fly my ship? 
LAFORGE: Well, this part, but the stress test did show that you tend to
push your ship a little beyond its design capabilities. 
OKONA: Blame the pattern of my life, Lieutenant La Forge. Because it
relegates me to cargo carrying rather than the grand explorations you
enjoy, I'm forced to add a measure of flamboyancy and a zest to the
doldrum of my existence.
