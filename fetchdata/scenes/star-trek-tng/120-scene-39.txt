[Engineering]

KONMEL: What magnificent battles we could have at
the helm of this ship. 
WORF: Perhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time. They belong
buried with the past. 
KORRIS: Standing here we will never know. Our answer lies out there.
Our instincts will lead us. 
KONMEL: Instincts that have not been dulled by living among civilised
men.

[Bridge]

DATA: I believe, sir, that was the first time
outsiders have witnessed the Klingon death ritual. 
PICARD: I can understand them looking at a dying man's eyes, but the
howling? 
DATA: It was a warning. 
PICARD: To whom? 
DATA: They are warning the dead, sir. Beware, a Klingon warrior is
about to arrive. 
LAFORGE: Captain, that unidentified vessel is approaching us at warp
five. Intersect one hour, sixteen minutes, thirty three seconds. 
PICARD: Can we get a visual? 
LAFORGE: I can try, sir. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
LAFORGE: Hello. 
RIKER: Klingons. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open. 
PICARD: Klingon cruiser, this is Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: I am Commander K'Nera. What is your purpose in
this area? 
PICARD: We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingon
survivors. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: That is all that is left of the crew of the
cruiser T'Acog? 
PICARD: They were not off the cruiser. They were from the freighter
Batris. The leader is Captain Korris. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: You have him on your ship? He is alive? 
PICARD: Yes. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: He is a criminal. A renegade, who with two
others stole that freighter, and somehow destroyed the Klingon cruiser
sent to bring them back. We expect the criminals to be delivered into
our custody as soon as we are within transporter range. 
(ends transmission) 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, where are they now? 
TASHA: They're with Worf on deck seventeen. 
PICARD: Deck seventeen? 
TASHA: Yes, sir. Near the auxiliary turbolift to the battle bridge.
Shall I alert Lieutenant Worf? 
PICARD: No. Send a security team. 
RIKER: You don't think Worf would allow them access to the battle
bridge? 
PICARD: I think, Number One, we cannot assume anything. 
TASHA: Captain, shall I stay at my tactical position or lead the
security team? 
PICARD: Lead the security team, and, Lieutenant, you understand with
whom you are dealing. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

KORRIS: We have heard this ship can separate in
time of battle. 
WORF: Yes. When relieved of its bulk, the Enterprise becomes an
exceptional weapon. 
TASHA: Worf. 
KORRIS: They have come for us. 
TASHA: Step aside. 
WORF: What is the problem? 
TASHA: The Captain wants those two taken into custody. 
KORRIS: Do not let them take us, Worf. Help us. 
KONMEL: Listen to the voice of your blood. You are not of these people.

KORRIS: Yes. Join us. 
(There's a tense moment, then a nearby turbolift opens and a little
girl runs out) 
TASHA: Go back! Please, turn around and go back to your mother. 
(Korris picks the girl up) 
TASHA: Bridge, we have a hostage situation on deck seventeen. 
(Korris glares, and hands the girl to Worf, who gives her to her
mother) 
GIRL: Mommy. 
TASHA: Bridge, this is Lieutenant Yar. Disregard. Situation is under
control. By order of the Captain, you are confined to Security. 
(Korris and Konmel are taken away) 
TASHA: I thought for a minute we had a problem. 
WORF: Oh? 
TASHA: Yes. It looked like Korris was going to hold that little girl as
a hostage. 
WORF: That is not our way. Cowards take hostages. Klingons do not. 
[Brig]

KORRIS: Ri'ario.

[Bridge]

(Worf enters) 
PICARD: Lieutenant. The Klingon vessel has to arrived. They have
requested return of the renegades. 
WORF: They will be tried and executed, sir. 
PICARD: I know. Lieutenant, understand that I am not unmindful of the
mixed feelings you must have about this incident. 
WORF: Thank you, sir. Are there no other options, sir? 
PICARD: None that I can see. 
RIKER: He seems to be handling this quite well, sir. 
PICARD: So far. He must be torn. These are his people. 
DATA: The Klingon vessel is within range, sir. They are requesting
visual contact. 
PICARD: Open frequencies. 
DATA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: We are in position now to receive the
criminals. 
PICARD: We're prepared to transfer. 
WORF: Captain. Request permission to address the Captain on the Klingon
vessel. I know it is against standard procedure, but there is something
I must say. 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
WORF: K'Mongi B'Mus. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: G'Armond T'Ris. What is it you want? 
WORF: To plead. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: You waste your time. Their actions threaten the
alliance. They disobeyed and must be punished. 
WORF: Yes, they must be punished, but not executed with dishonour. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: Why do you care? 
WORF: What burns in their eyes, fires my soul. I hear their words, and
I see it all as it was. Part of me longs for that time. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: It's bred in the bone. We all do. 
WORF: Then send them to a planet in the Halee system, where they can
meet death on their feet with a weapon in their hands, not tied and
helpless. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: When one of us dies that way it diminishes all
of us. 
WORF: Yes. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: Brother, I feel as you. I too wish they could
fly free, but I have no choice. 
WORF: Sir. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: We await the transfer. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, escort the prisoners to the Transporter room. 
TASHA [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Brig]

(The prisoners are taking elements from their
belts, the hooks from their boots and building a gun of some sort. Then
Korris uses a metal piece to deactivate the forcefield)

[Corridor]

GUARD: This is Ramos. The forcefield in Security
Three has been broken. 
(He tries to go in, and gets shot) 
(Another guard dodges Konmel's shots and gets him, although it takes
three blasts to put him down. Korris uses Ramos's phaser to kill the
guard) 
TASHA: Lieutenant Yar to Bridge.
