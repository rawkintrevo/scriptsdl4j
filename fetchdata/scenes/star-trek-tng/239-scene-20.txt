TROI AQUIEL WORF PICARD LAFORGE RIKER TORAK DATA MORAG

[Observation lounge]

MORAG: I killed no one! 
RIKER: We found your DNA on the bulkheads and the console. We know you
were there. 
TORAK: Answer their questions. 
MORAG: Yes. Yes, I was there. My patrol route takes me near the station
every six days. Three days ago, I hailed them. There was no response. I
was concerned. 
TROI: Concerned? 
MORAG: Yes. I went aboard to see what had happened. There was no one
was there, so I left. 
RIKER: Is that all? 
MORAG: That's all. 
DATA: Commander Morag, we have discovered that the encrypted message
bank on the station has been tampered with. Our analysis indicates that
twenty seven priority Starfleet messages are missing. 
MORAG: What of it? 
DATA: Your DNA was also found on the message control module. 
MORAG: This is outrageous! We will not tolerate these ridiculous
accusations! 
TORAK: This is a diplomatic matter, Morag! Do not make me search your
ship. 
MORAG: Yes, I did take the messages. 
PICARD: Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha? 
MORAG: No. I killed no one. There was no one there. I took the codes,
but I killed no one. 
PICARD: Governor, we would like Commander Morag to remain on board the
Enterprise until this investigation is complete. 
TORAK: Take him. 
WORF: This way.

[Relay Station ops]

LAFORGE: Last night, after I dropped you off at
your quarters you established a subspace link with this console.
You deleted some of Rocha's personal files, didn't you? 
AQUIEL: Yes, I did. 
LAFORGE: Why? 
AQUIEL: I found a letter Rocha was planning to send to Starfleet
Command about me. The letter said I had become belligerent and
insubordinate. He was going to ask for a formal hearing. Geordi, I know
how this looks. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, it looks bad. I find out that you've erased a letter
that contained a possible motivation for murder? 
AQUIEL: I didn't kill him. 
LAFORGE: Then explain this. 
AQUIEL: I was afraid if they found the letter they'd blame me for the
murder. I'm not a model officer. I realise that. Sometimes I act on
impulse instead of thinking things through. 
LAFORGE: Aquiel, this really complicates things. 
[Aquiel's quarters] 
(she grabs a case and starts packing) 
LAFORGE: What are you doing? 
AQUIEL: Getting out of here. 
LAFORGE: Aquiel, running away isn't going to prove your innocence.
Facing the situation will. 
AQUIEL: I'm scared, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Look, we'll get through this. I promise you, okay? 
AQUIEL: Then you believe me? 
LAFORGE: Yes, I do.

Medical Officer's log, supplemental. I've isolated
the cellular residue from the
deck plate, but the DNA has destabilised. I'm attempting to reform it.
