[War room]

CASTILLO: I'm prepared to lead the Enterprise back
myself, Captain Picard. 
RIKER: Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the last surviving senior officer.
He will have limited support from Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff in
Engineering. 
CASTILLO: I have good people willing to do their best. 
RIKER: Certainly, history never meant for this ship to go into battle
without her captain. 
CASTILLO: I can't speak to that point, sir, but I can get us back to
where we're supposed to be. I believe that's what Captain Garrett would
want me to do. 
DATA [OC]: Commander Data to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
DATA [OC]: Sir, sensors are showing additional instability in the time
rift. Possibly the result of the battle with the Klingons. 
PICARD: Any signs of other Klingon vessels? 
DATA [OC]: No, sir. 
TASHA: Our coordinates have been transmitted to the Klingon command,
sir. We mustn't remain here. 
CASTILLO: Sir, it is my intention to return, unless you order me not
to. 
PICARD: How soon can your ship be ready? 
CASTILLO: We sustained moderate damage in the attack. I think we can
get underway in a few hours. 
PICARD: Make it so. We'll give you cover.
