TROI IAN LAFORGE PICARD RIKER PULASKI WESLEY COMPUTER DEALT DATA

[Cargo deck five]

RIKER: Why this module and not the others? 
DATA: Computer, run diagnostic on module L seven three. 
COMPUTER: (male) All circuits functional. 
LAFORGE: Environment's as programmed. Temperature ninety seven degrees
Kelvin. Radiation flux zero. Stasis field nominal. Everything exactly
as it should be, right down the line. 
DATA: Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growth
actually occurring in module L seven three? 
COMPUTER: Confirmed. 
(Pulaski enters) 
RIKER: Doctor, one of the specimens is growing. 
PULASKI: Destroy it now. 
DEALT: I can't. 
RIKER: Data, prepare to jettison the module. 
DEALT: We can't do that either. It will go into a spore and remain
until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship. The results
would be disastrous. 
RIKER: Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think it
is, it's actually worse. 
DEALT: This is not going to hold it. 
RIKER: Go on. 
DEALT: The rate of growth is increasing so rapidly, within thirty
minutes it's going to push out of it's module. Within two hours, it'll
break out of the containment area. 
LAFORGE: No, no, no. It can't break through this. 
DEALT: Yes, it will. 
RIKER: Captain, we may not be able to get control of this situation. I
recommend we arrange transfer of all non-essential personnel to the
saucer section. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: If we lose containment, we should be
prepared to separate. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
[Cargo deck five]

PULASKI: Why this one specimen and none of the
others? Something is stimulating it. Do you have its etiology? Do you
know how it was developed? 
DEALT: Yes, it's right over here. 
PULASKI: It's a mutated strain developed by Doctor Susan Nuress during
an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the Oby System. It
was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests. This particular one
bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth? 
DEALT: It could, but I. I've got something. 
RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? 
DEALT: I don't know. It wasn't here before. 
PULASKI: Well, it is now. What emits that type of radiation? 
DATA: A subspace phase inverter. 
LAFORGE: We don't have one. 
DATA: Certain cyanoacrylates. 
PULASKI: Also not on this ship. What else? Because it's here and we
better find it.

[Troi's quarters]

(It's Ian's bed time) 
IAN: I can feel that some of the people are very worried. 
TROI: Yes. I feel it too, but don't you worry. 
IAN: It's me, Mommy. I'm the reason. 
TROI: What? 
IAN: It's me. 
TROI: You? 
IAN: Yes. I have to leave you now, or it'll be very bad for everyone. 
TROI: What are you saying? 
IAN: I have to leave now. 
TROI: Leave? You are going to die. No, you can't! Sickbay, this is
Counsellor Troi, I need the Doctor in my quarters now! Ian! Ian, no.
Ian. 
(Pulaski arrives with Data and Riker) 
TROI: It's Ian. Hurry. 
PULASKI: What happened? Did he eat anything? Did he fall? 
TROI: No. 
DATA: Commander, the child is the source of the unusual radiation. 
TROI: Ian said he's the reason the ship is in danger. 
DATA: That analysis is correct. 
PULASKI: I'm losing life signs. 
TROI: You must save him. 
PULASKI: I'm sorry. 
(As Troi weeps by the bed, Ian turns into a ball of light which she can
hold in her hands. She calms and smiles, then it flies out into space) 
LAFORGE [OC]: Commander Riker, the containment field has stabilised. 
RIKER: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
TROI: Then Ian was right. He was the cause. 
RIKER: Apparently so. 
TROI: He is a life force entity. When we passed each other in space, he
was curious about us, so he decided the best way to learn was to go
through the process. To be born, to live as one of us and in that way
to understand us. He never meant any harm. 
RIKER: There was a moment when you smiled. 
TROI: He said, thank you. I told him we will miss him. And I will.

[Bridge]

(approaching a space station) 
PICARD: Standard station orbit, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir, standard orbit. 
PICARD: Transporter room three, this is the Captain. We have arrived. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Let's make this transfer with all
deliberate speed. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I'll be glad to be relieved of this cargo. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
WESLEY: Captain. Could I see you when you have a moment? 
PICARD: In my Ready room, when your duties permit. 
WESLEY: Thank you, sir.
