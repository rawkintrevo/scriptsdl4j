TAURIK: Excuse me, sir. Do you have a minute? 
LAFORGE: Sure, Taurik. What is it? 
TAURIK: I'd like you to take a look at something. 
LAFORGE: Have you been improvising again, Ensign? 
TAURIK: In a manner of speaking. I'm running a computer simulation to
test a new warp field configuration. 
LAFORGE: You've got a problem here. Your plasma flow to the nacelles is
out of sync. 
TAURIK: Actually, sir, that was done deliberately. As you can see, this
configuration has increased overall warp field integrity by seven
percent. 
LAFORGE: You're right. 
TAURIK: Doctor Nils Diaz has been experimenting with this technique at
the Tanaline Propulsion Laboratory. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm familiar with his work, but I never heard anything
about this. 
TAURIK: His findings have not been released yet. I was able to review a
preliminary report when I was at the Academy. 
LAFORGE: I look forward to reading about it 
TAURIK: I predict that when these findings are made public, they will
become a new model for warp field operation. 
LAFORGE: Sounds interesting. 
TAURIK: With your permission, sir, I'd like to begin tests to see if
the technique can be adapted to our warp drive. 
LAFORGE: There might be variables that you didn't account for. 
TAURIK: I was quite thorough. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure you were, but I'd still need to see your simulation
before I authorise any tests. 
TAURIK: As you wish. 
LAFORGE: If you have any other ideas for increasing efficiency, don't
hesitate to run them by me. 
TAURIK: As a matter of fact, sir, I do. When would be a good time to
discuss them? 
LAFORGE: I'll get back to you on that.
