RIKER: Lock phasers on target. 
SITO: Phasers locked. 
DATA: The enemy is firing. 
RIKER: Helm, hard to starboard. 
LAVELLE: Hard to starboard. 
RIKER: Fire phasers. 
(a pause as she finds the right buttons) 
SITO: Firing. 
DATA: Target is destroyed. 
RIKER: End simulation sequence. Secure from drill. Alpha shift, your
response time was seven percent slower than the gamma shift. All
departments, submit drill evaluation reports

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: By oh nine hundred hours. 
LAFORGE: Ensign, you'll write that report. 
TAURIK: Yes, sir.

RIKER: What happened back there, Ensign? 
SITO: I'm sorry, sir. When we changed course I had to re-lock phasers
before I could fire. 
RIKER: Next time, try letting the locking relay float until the actual
order to fire is given. They may not teach that trick at the Academy,
but it works. 
SITO: Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: Lavelle. 
LAVELLE: Sir? 
RIKER: Resume previous course and speed. 
LAVELLE: Aye, aye, sir. 
RIKER: One aye is sufficient acknowledgment, Ensign. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Helm, change course for the Argaya system, maximum warp. 
LAVELLE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: What happened to the rendezvous with the Clement? 
PICARD: I've just received new orders from Starfleet. We'll discuss it
in the Observation lounge. Mister Data, Mister Worf. 
RIKER: Ensign Sito, take over at Ops. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
(Riker, Data, Worf and Picard leave) 
SITO: The Argaya system's close to the Cardassian border. I wonder why
we're going there. How'd you like to be a spider under that table? 
LAVELLE: What? 
SITO: A spider under the table. 
LAVELLE: Is that like a fly on the wall? 
SITO: I guess so. You did really well during the drill. 
LAVELLE: Well apparently Commander Riker didn't think so. I swear he's
got it in for me. 
SITO: You're imagining things. 
LAVELLE: Yeah? Then how come you're sitting in that chair instead of
me? 
SITO: I guess he figured I need more practice than you do.
