[Particle fountain laboratory]

FARALLON: We're definitely making progress,
Captain. I'm not sure we'll be at full capacity within the forty eight
hour deadline, but we'll be close. 
LAFORGE: It looks like there's still some difficulty with the phase
selectors. 
FARALLON: That's true, but I'm sure it's the last real problem. 
PICARD: I hope for the sake of the project that I hope you're right,
Doctor. 
FARALLON: I understand, sir. We're going to do our best. 
(and the lights go out) 
FARALLON: This is strange. Primary power is still online. 
LAFORGE: Maybe it's another power grid malfunction? 
FARALLON: I don't think so. Something seems to be drawing power into
the main particle impeller. That's not a good sign. It could mean 
(the place rocks) 
FARALLON: We've lost internal confinement. The particle stream is
beginning to surge. 
LAFORGE: Captain, a radiation field is going to flood this chamber.
We've got to get everybody out of here immediately. 
PICARD: Understood. Doctor, the station must be evacuated. 
FARALLON: Captain, I might still 
PICARD: That is an order, Doctor. Now, assemble all personnel on the
transporter pad. Now! Picard to Enterprise.

PICARD [OC]: Do you read me? 
RIKER: Riker here, sir. 
WORF: Radiation field is increasing. We are losing communications. 
PICARD [OC]: Prepare for emergency transport. 
RIKER: Red alert. Riker to transporter room two. Prepare for emergency
transport.

[Particle fountain laboratory]

LAFORGE: The radiation is setting up a field
ionisation effect, Captain. We've got less than a minute to beam out of
here. 
PICARD: Is that everybody? 
FARALLON: Where's Takenta? He was over there, near the impeller
control. 
LAFORGE: I'll get him. Takenta! 
(Geordi disappears from view then there's a big flash) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge! Stand by to transport. 
FARALLON: Captain, you'll be trapped here. 
(Picard beams them away) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge! Mister La Forge, are you all right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I'm fine, Captain. I only caught the edge of it. He's
dead.

[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: Chief, do you have them? 
KELSO: They're here, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: Is everyone all right? 
FARALLON: We're fine, sir. But Captain Picard, Commander La Forge and
one of my men

[Bridge]

FARALLON [OC]: Are still on the station. 
RIKER: Kelso, can you get them off?
