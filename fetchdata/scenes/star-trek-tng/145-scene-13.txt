[Hill's outer office]

PICARD: So, Madeline, I'll see you later. Activate
programme. 
GUEST2: Leaving, Dix? You're not to Rex's bar, are you? 
PICARD: Rex's bar? Why do you ask? 
GUEST2: It's one of the messages I left on your desk. 
PICARD: That sounds like an excellent idea. Would you care to join me? 
GUEST2: Me? Have a drink with you? 
PICARD: Why not? 
GUEST2: There ain't no why not about it. It's just that this is the
first time you ever asked. 
PICARD: Is that a problem? 
GUEST2: Not for me, but you'd better take this. (a revolver) 
PICARD: Why? 
GUEST2: Because if we're going to Rex's bar, you're gonna need it.

[Rex's Bar]

(Mostly empty, Moonlight Serenade playing, ceiling
fans turning lazily) 
GUEST5: Hey, Dix. What do you know and what do you say? See this?
(newspaper) Germany's getting ready to invade England. 
GUEST2: Who's going to stop them? 
GUEST5: Somebody'd better. 
GUEST2: Just as long as it isn't us. The last thing America needs to
do is fight in another world war. 
PICARD: Actually, the Second World War, although disastrous, did end
with the United States taking its place as a dominant world power and
cultural influence in the second half of the twentieth century.
Additionally, that war was a catalyst of technological advancement.
Developments in rocketry and fission resonate on into the twenty fourth
century. 
GUEST5: I don't know if I should pour you one, Dix. Sounds like you've got
a snootful already. 
PICARD: What's this? 
GUEST5: The usual. 
PICARD: Ah, now let me see. That would be Scotch, neat. 
GUEST5: What else? 
(Picard takes Madeline's proffered cigarette, Rex lights it. He takes a
puff then looks at it from arms length) 
GUEST5: And for the lady? 
GUEST2: Rye and ginger. 
(Rex taps the bar and rubs his fingers together. Picard imitates him) 
PICARD: Money. I keep forgetting the need to carry money. I must
remember not to let this happen again. 
GUEST5: Right. I don't mind you being on the cuff, but you're up the
sleeve halfway to my collar. 
PICARD: Is that why you wanted to see me, about my bar bill? 
GUEST5: No, it's on account of Jimmy Cuzzo. 
PICARD: Jimmy Cuzzo. I know that name. 
GUEST2: He's why I gave you the gun. 
PICARD: What was the name of that case he was involved in? The Parrot's
Claw. 
GUEST2: Jeez, Dix. Cuzzo's the guy who iced Marty O'Farron. They
never would have nailed him if it hadn't been for you. Your testimony
got him arraigned. 
GUEST5: Yeah. Yours and mine. 
PICARD: So you brought me here because you didn't want to face him
alone. 
GUEST5: I don't want to face him at all. I'm hoping that seeing us
together will slow him up long enough to get some things straight. 
PICARD: And if it doesn't? 
GUEST5: Then you just have to kill him.
