(a large orange sun is on the viewscreen) 
RIKER: Very impressive. 
TROI: It's beautiful, but frightening at the same time.
DATA: Captain, I am detecting a transmission emanating from within the
system.
RIKER: What sort of signal?
DATA: It is self-repeating, of unknown pattern.
PICARD: Where is it coming from?
DATA: A small moon orbiting the fourth planet.
PICARD: Life signs?
DATA: Indeterminate. I am attempting to screen out sensor interference.
Readings are still inconclusive, however the moon's atmosphere is
capable of supporting life.
RIKER: It could be a distress call. Helm, take us into transport range.
Doctor Crusher, meet me in transporter room two with a medical away
team.
CRUSHER [OC]: Acknowledged.

[Crash site]

CRUSHER: I'm reading one life form, very weak signs.
(they go to the square-shaped wreckage and lift a piece of metal off a
body with pale skin and lots of cybernetic implants) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise.
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Number One.
RIKER: We've found the wreckage of a small craft.
