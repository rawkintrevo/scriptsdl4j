LETEK: If he moves, kill him. 
MORDOC: Letek, has what we've done broken our agreement with their
captain? 
LETEK: We will accuse the humans of preparing to ambush us. It will be
our word against theirs and who is more trustworthy, Mordoc? (the comm.
badge) It looks like gold. Tastes like gold. 
RIKER: It is gold. 
(Renewed thunder and lightning makes the Ferengi try to cover their
ears) 
LETEK: Accursed planet! 
RIKER: It's nothing compared to what our Captain will do when he finds
out you've broken our landing party agreement. 
LETEK: What part of the agreement? You appeared and attacked us. Are
you one of their assassins? 
RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker, First Officer of the USS
Enterprise. You have a lot to learn.

MORDOC: Is this a female? 
KAYRON: A human female, Letek?

to wear clothing. 
MORDOC: Sickening.

PICARD: I've diverted the reserve power to the
family decks. They'll last longest. Is there anything else we can do,
Doctor? Where's Wesley? 
CRUSHER: He's in our quarters. I was tempted to give him a sedative. 
PICARD: You shouldn't. 
CRUSHER: I know, but he's my son. I love him. 
PICARD: He has the right to meet death awake. 
CRUSHER: Is that a male perspective? 
PICARD: Rubbish
