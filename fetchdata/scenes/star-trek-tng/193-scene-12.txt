LARSON: (a lady engineer) Commander, warp power has
been transferred to the shield grid. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but by whom? 
(Reg wanders over and presses a control next to La Forge, then returns
to his own panel) 
LAFORGE: Barclay, what are you doing? 
BARCLAY: Lieutenant Barclay to Captain Picard. You can fire photon
torpedoes. 
[Bridge]

BARCLAY [OC]: Maximum yield, full spread. 
RIKER: We're too close. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm certain the shields will hold. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I don't know how he did it, but shield
strength has been increased by three hundred percent. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: It should be enough, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf. Photon torpedoes. Maximum yield, full spread. 
WORF: Aye. 
(three direct hits and a big light display. The ship rocks) 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Barclay.

[Engineering]

BARCLAY: You're welcome, Captain. Barclay out. I'm
sorry if I overstepped my authority. 
LAFORGE: (to himself) Don't mention it.

Captain's log, stardate 44705.3. The Enterprise has
destroyed the alien probe, but now we are left with the difficult task
of repairing the Argus Telescope. Failure to do so would represent an
incalculable scientific loss.
