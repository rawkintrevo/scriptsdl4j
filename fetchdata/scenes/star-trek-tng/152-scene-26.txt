MAN: Where? 
TROI: Over there. 
[Assembly hall]

RIKER: That knot won't hold. If I may? 
FENTO: Please do. 
RIKER: You need a knot that'll tighten under pressure. Let me show you.

[Path]

OJI: Father, the sun's reaching its zenith. If I
don't go to measure 
LIKO: Go.

[Assembly hall]

(Riker is gagging the bound Fento) 
RIKER: Forgive me, friend, but the stranger must be set free. 
[Outside the hall]

OJI: Riker? 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and prepare to beam us directly to
Sickbay, but hang on for my signal. 
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged, Commander. 
OJI: Riker, stop!

[Path]

(The adults hear her calling) 
NURIA: Oji? 
OJI [OC]: It's Riker, he's taking Palmer! 
NURIA: Hali. Yuri, don't let her escape.
(Riker rounds a rock outcrop out of line of Hali's bow, and hides) 
RIKER: I'm clear. Energise!

[Sickbay]

RIKER: Data, has Counsellor Troi beamed up? 
DATA [OC]: Negative, Commander. Sensors show she's in the midst of a
group of Mintakans. 
RIKER: Damn.

[Assembly hall]

(Fento is untied) 
NURIA: He is all right. Hali, find Riker and Palmer. 
LIKO: Why did you and Riker take Palmer from us? 
TROI: We did not take Palmer.
