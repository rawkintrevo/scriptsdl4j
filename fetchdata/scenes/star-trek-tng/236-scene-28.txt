CARDASSIAN RIKER WORF JELLICO CRUSHER DATA

[Chamber]

(the door slides open and they dash into another
rock chamber with just one single pulsing piece of equipment.) 
CRUSHER: There's no one here. There's no lab. PICARD: It's a trap. Come
on. 
(there is weapons fire, then the door starts to close. Worf blocks it
with his body. Beverly squeezes through but Picard is in hand-to-hand
combat) 
WORF: Captain! 
(an injured Cardassian shoots Worf in the shoulder and he falls out of
the chamber. By the time Picard gets there, the door is shut)

[Installation entrance]

CRUSHER: Let's go. WORF: The Captain. 
CRUSHER: No. There are five more of them heading this way from another
tunnel. Come on. Now! 
[Chamber]

(Picard drops his phaser. One of the Cardassians
switches off the device and they take their prisoner away) 
CARDASSIAN: Come on. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Captain on the Bridge. 
JELLICO: What have you got, Will? 
RIKER: I'm not sure. We're picking up a lot of coded messages from a
Cardassian planet near the border. 
JELLICO: Which planet? 
RIKER: Celtris Three. 
JELLICO: Can you detect any theta-band subspace emissions coming from
Celtris? 
RIKER: There are some residual traces. It seems there were emissions up
until a few minutes ago. 
JELLICO: Open a secure channel to Admiral Nechayev. Priority two. Put
it through to my Ready room. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.
