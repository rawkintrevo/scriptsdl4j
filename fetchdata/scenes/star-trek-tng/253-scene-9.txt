[Planet surface]

(Worf and Riker hide from a Borg patrol, then come
over a ridge.) 
WORF: Commander. 
(it's the building, and they're surrounded by Borg)

[Caverns]

RIKER: Hugh? 
GUEST7: Why are you here, Commander Riker? Hasn't the crew of the
Enterprise caused enough damage already? 
(a little later) 
WORF: So you blame us for what has happened to the Borg? 
GUEST7: You gave me a sense of individuality, changed me, then sent me
back to the Collective. You must have known that change would be passed
on to others. 
RIKER: We considered it. We knew it was a possibility. 
GUEST7: Then you made it possible for Lore to dominate us. 
WORF: I cannot accept that. Lore is only one. The Borg could have
stopped him. 
GUEST7: You don't know the condition we were in when he found us. Before
my experience on the Enterprise, the Borg were a single-minded
Collective. The voices in our heads were smooth and flowing. But after
I returned, those voices began to change. They became uneven,
discordant. For the first time, individual Borg had differing ideas
about how to proceed. We couldn't function. Some Borg fought each
other. Others simply shut themselves down. Many starved to death. 
RIKER: And then Lore came along. 
GUEST7: You probably can't imagine what it is like to be so lost and
frightened that you will listen to any voice which promises change. 
WORF: Even if that voice insists on controlling you. 
GUEST7: That's what we wanted. Someone to show us the way out of
confusion. Lore promised clarity and purpose. In the beginning, he
seemed like a saviour. The promise of becoming a superior race, of
becoming fully artificial was
compelling. We gladly did everything he asked of us. But after a while,
it became clear that Lore had no idea how to keep his promise. That's
when he began talking about the need for us to make sacrifices. Before
we realised it, this was the result. 
RIKER: What happened to them? 
GUEST7: Lore began to experiment, trying to re-make us in his image. This
is the result of my encounter with the Enterprise, Commander. So you
can see I don't particularly welcome your presence here. 
RIKER: I'm sorry you feel that way. We just came to get our people. We
won't cause you any more trouble. 
GUEST7: Tell me about my friend. 
RIKER: Friend? 
GUEST7: The human called Geordi. 
RIKER: I wish I could tell you about him. We think he may be held
inside the compound. 
GUEST7: I cannot help you. I cannot risk our being discovered. 
RIKER: Can you at least show us a way into the compound? 
GUEST7: These caverns lead to tunnels which run beneath the compound.
Some of them connect with the environmental control ducts. 
WORF: Show us. If we can determine the geography of the compound, we
can form a rescue plan.
