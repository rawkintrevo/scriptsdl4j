[Data's quarters]

(Spot is sitting on the computer console) 
DATA: Spot. Spot. Spot, down. Spot, down. Down. Spot. (lifting the cat
off the desk) Down. This is down. Down is good. This is up. Up is no. 
(doorbell) 
DATA: (to Spot) One moment. Come in. 
LAFORGE: Data. I had another idea that might help boost the power
conversion levels. Could you give me a hand? 
DATA: I would be happy to. 
LAFORGE: Don't tell me you're trying to teach the cat to use the
console. 
DATA: It is part of her training programme. I am teaching Spot to jump
down from the desk on my command. 
LAFORGE: How's it going? 
DATA: I have not been entirely successful. 
(Spot meows, and Data goes to the replicator) 
DATA: Feline supplement number two twenty one. 
LAFORGE: Data, that cat definitely has a mind of her own. Maybe she's
just not trainable. 
DATA: I suppose I must accept that possibility. It may be that Spot
lacks the intelligence necessary to learn the appropriate responses to
my commands. 
(Spot meows again and Data fetches her a toy) 
LAFORGE: I don't know about Spot, but it seems to me your training is
coming along just fine. Come on, let's go.
