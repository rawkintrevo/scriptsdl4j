[Outside Holodeck]

LAFORGE: LaForge to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
LAFORGE: I can't find the Captain, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: I told you, he's in the holodeck.
LAFORGE: I'm at the holodeck. Something's gone wrong.
RIKER [OC]: What are you saying? 
LAFORGE: I can't communicate with him, I can't access the programme,
and I can't open the doors.

Enterprise log, supplemental. First Officer
reporting. Due to an unknown breakdown in the holodeck, we are unable
to contact the Captain.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Tasha, take over. I'm going to holodeck
three. 
WESLEY: Commander? I've studied all the technical manuals on the
holodecks, sir. I think I can be of some help down there. 
RIKER: Geordi's well equipped to deal with the situation, Wes. Right
now, your duty's here on the Bridge.
TROI: Will. His mother's missing too. 
RIKER: Come on, Wesley. 
[Interrogation room]

BELL: And you say you never met her before she came
to hire you. 
PICARD: I've already told you that twice. 
BELL: Yeah? Well you're going to have to tell me again. 
PICARD: Look fellas, this is no longer amusing. 
MCNARY: Easy, Dan! 
BELL: You think you're tough, Hill, but you're nothing! 
(Bell leaves) 
MCNARY: Don't take him too seriously, Dix. His old lady's been giving
him a hard time. You know how it is. 
PICARD: Actually, I do need to get out of here. 
MCNARY: I'll see what I can do.
