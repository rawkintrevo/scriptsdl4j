[Arkaria base]

DATA: Hmm. Yes. I find it fascinating that your
family chose to drop the prefix Pel from your surname. It was my
understanding that Pel Orton is a more noble appellation on Arkaria
than simply Orton. 
ORTON: Yes. 
DATA: Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend toward a more egalitarian
society is partly responsible, eh? 
ORTON: Perhaps. 
HUTCH: The crew of the Magellan actually put on a talent show here.
Captain Conklin did a poetry reading, if you can imagine that. 
RIKER: I'm trying to. 
HUTCH: Did I ever tell you how I came to be stationed here? It's a
fascinating story. I was serving on Admiral Mitchell's staff on
Starbase ninety seven. Awful place, by the way. 
RIKER: Have you met our Commander Data? 
DATA: As a matter of fact, I find it oddly amusing. 
HUTCH: No, I don't think so. 
RIKER: I'll introduce you. 
DATA: There are several cultures in this sector with extremely similar
etymological histories. For example 
RIKER: Mister Data, I don't know if you've had a chance to meet our
host, Commander Hutchinson. Call him Hutch. Lieutenant Commander Data,
our second officer. 
HUTCH: A pleasure. 
DATA: The pleasure is mine, Hutch. I have been meaning to compliment
you on your choice of colours here. 
HUTCH: Oh, you really think so? It wasn't easy making a final decision,
let me tell you. 
DATA: I can well imagine. The light in this room would make colour
selection exceptionally problematic. 
HUTCH: Precisely. 
ORTON: Thank you. 
RIKER: You're welcome. I'm not sure which one to feel sorry for. 
WAITER: Mister Orton? 
ORTON: You'll excuse me, Commander. 
RIKER: Geordi, what happened to the Captain? 
LAFORGE: Oh, he went back to the ship to get his saddle. 
RIKER: His saddle? 
LAFORGE: Any serious rider would have his own saddle. 
RIKER: Oh. 
LAFORGE: Probably he went right to the stables. I bet he's ten
kilometres from here already. 
RIKER: Lucky him. Thank you.

(Picard drags the unconscious Devor into the room
and starts rifling through drawers.) 
KELSEY [OC]: Kelsey to Devor. Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply. Devor, do
you read me? Kelsey to Kiros. 
KIROS [OC]: This is Kiros. 
KELSEY [OC]: Devor isn't responding. There must be too much
interference from the baryon sweep. Go find him and see if he finished
by passing the regulator on deck seven, then meet us in main
Engineering. 
KIROS [OC]: Understood. 
(Picard wakes Devor) 
PICARD: Hey. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? 
DEVOR: The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency plasma field. Your phaser
won't work. 
PICARD: You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laser
welder can be deadly. What's going on in main Engineering? I suggest
that you cooperate. 
DEVOR: You're Starfleet. You won't kill me. 
PICARD: You sure? 
(Picard hypos him instead) 
PICARD: Seems you're right.

Tallman in alien makeup as Kiros)
