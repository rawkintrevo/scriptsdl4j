[Ten Forward]

VASH: I don't understand, I thought being the
ship's Counsellor meant the Captain confided in you. 
TROI: He does, when he thinks it's necessary. 
VASH: And he never spoke to you about me? 
TROI: Not that I recall. 
VASH: Not even a hint? 
TROI: You must understand, the Captain is a very 
TROI + VASH: Private man. 
VASH: I know. Excuse me? 
TROI: Of course. 
WORF: Nice legs. For a human. 
VASH: Jean-Luc, we need to talk. 
PICARD: Excuse me. 
(they go to a quiet corner) 
PICARD: The reception seems to be going well. 
VASH: Forget the reception for a moment. Why have you never mentioned
me to your friends? 
PICARD: What would you have me tell them? 
VASH: Maybe that we met, for one thing. That we had an adventure
together, some fun. 
PICARD: It wouldn't be possible. 
VASH: Why not? 
PICARD: It would be inappropriate. 
VASH: I wasn't expecting you to go into intimate details. 
PICARD: A Captain does not reveal his personal feelings with his crew. 
VASH: Is that a Starfleet regulation, or did you just make that up
yourself? 
PICARD: I'm sorry if you're upset. 
VASH: And I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
