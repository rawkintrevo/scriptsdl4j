[Someone's quarters]

RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the
deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards have been sufficiently
randomised. 
WORF: I hope so. 
DATA: Eight. Ace. Queen. The dealer receives a four. 
WORF: No bet. 
DATA: Ten. Seven. No help there. A pair of ladies for the Doctor.
Dealer receives a nine. Doctor? May I remind you since you show the
highest hand, you control the next bet. 
WORF: Is there something wrong, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: No. I bet ten. 
DATA: Jack. Four. Deuce. Six. 
CRUSHER: Twenty. 
RIKER: Your twenty and I'll raise you fifty. You're going to call my
bluff, aren't you. I think I'll quit while I'm ahead. 
CRUSHER: How did you know I was going to call your bluff? 
RIKER: I just had a feeling. 
CRUSHER: Me too. 
OGAWA [OC]: Ogawa to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Go ahead. 
OGAWA [OC]: Commander La Forge needs you in Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: On my way.

LAFORGE: At first I thought the catwalk was

CRUSHER: You have all the symptoms of an inner ear infection. That
would explain your the headaches and the dizziness. But there's no
physical 
LAFORGE: What? What is it? 
CRUSHER: Geordi, have you ever had these symptoms before? 
LAFORGE: Now that you mention it, I think I have. 
CRUSHER: Do you recall when? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't. 
CRUSHER: We've had this discussion before and I know I've given you
this examination. Let's check the medical logs. You've been treated
several times for headaches related to your visor, but I read no
mention of dizziness. 
LAFORGE: Must be dj vu. 
CRUSHER: Both of us? About the same thing?
