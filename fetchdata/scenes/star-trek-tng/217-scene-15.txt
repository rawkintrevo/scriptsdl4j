TROI SOREN RIKER
ve people come cuddly thought stored names pure friends

[Woods]

SOREN: One of my favourites is this menellen tree.
The leaves first turn pure white, and then blue, when the weather gets
cold. This is called a falla bush. It produces a fragrant flower on
only one day of the year. 
(and finally they get down to the real purpose of the walk, with Riker
trying to eat her tonsils)

detailed map of null space will prevent the loss of other ships, we
remain in orbit of J'naii, charting the anomaly.

[Troi's quarters]

(Troi is taking a woollen doll from a suitcase when
the doorbell rings) 
TROI: Come in. Hello, Will. 
RIKER: What's all this? 
TROI: Wonderful things. My mother sent me a box that belonged to one of
my father's ancestors. It was stored on Earth and just recently turned
up. 
RIKER: Do you know who any of these people are? 
TROI: No. Some of the pictures have names on, but most of them don't. I
look at these faces and I wonder who they are and if they could be
related to me. 
RIKER: This one looks like you. (a cuddly toy) Deanna, I have something
on my mind. I had to see you. 
TROI: Has something happened? 
RIKER: I've met someone. Someone who's becoming important to me. 
TROI: Soren. 
RIKER: Yes. You're my friend. I thought, I don't know, I thought I
should tell you. 
TROI: I'm glad you did. 
RIKER: Nothing will change between us, will it? 
TROI: Of course it will. All relationships are constantly changing. But
we'll still be friends, maybe better friends. You're a part of my life,
and I'm a part of yours. That much will always be true. 
(and they kiss, too)
