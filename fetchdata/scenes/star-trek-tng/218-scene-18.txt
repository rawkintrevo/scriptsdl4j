TROI CRUSHER LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER RO DATA

[Engineering]

(Geordi is making adjustments inside Data's head) 
LAFORGE: You know, it's possible we've tried this a thousand times and
it's never worked. 
CRUSHER: Do you have a feeling that you've done this before? 
LAFORGE: No, I don't. 
CRUSHER: Neither do I. Maybe that's a good sign. 
LAFORGE: Let's test the emitter. 
DATA: Particle accelerators at full power. 
LAFORGE: Dekyon field active. Particle flux nominal. We're in business.

CRUSHER: All we need now is a message. 
RIKER [OC]: Senior officers, report to the Bridge. 
(Red alert sounds) 
CRUSHER: On our way.

[Bridge]

RIKER: We've got to figure out how we've handled
this before. 
PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. 
RO: Aye sir. Captain manoeuvring thrusters are not responding. 
DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating. 
LAFORGE: All main systems just went down. Power levels are dropping
rapidly. 
DATA: There is an energy build up in the distortion field. 
TROI: We have to get out of here now. 
DATA: Captain, something is emerging. 
(here comes the ship) 
RIKER: Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres. 
WORF: Shields inoperative. 
RO: The helm's not responding. 
DATA: The vessel is on a collision course. Impact in thirty six
seconds. 
PICARD: Hail them. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Suggestions? 
RIKER: Decompress main shuttlebay. The explosive reaction may blow us
out of the way. 
DATA: Captain, I recommend we use the tractor beam to alter the other
ship's trajectory. 
PICARD: Make it so, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Engaging tractor beam. 
(thump) 
RIKER: Damage report! 
CRUSHER: Casualty reports are coming in from all over the ship. 
DATA: Starboard nacelle has sustained a direct impact. We are venting
drive plasma. 
LAFORGE: Initiating emergency core shutdown. 
RO: Inertial dampers failing. We're losing attitude control. 
RIKER: This is the Bridge. All hands to emergency escape pods. 
DATA: Core shutdown is unsuccessful. We are losing antimatter
containment. 
LAFORGE: We got to eject the core! 
DATA: Ejection systems are offline. Core breach is imminent. 
(Data taps something into his dekyon emitter) 
PICARD: All hands abandon ship. Repeat, all hands abandon 
(KaBOOM!!!!)

Captain's log, stardate 45652.1. The Enterprise has
entered an area of space known as the Typhon Expanse. We are the first
Starfleet vessel to chart this unexplored region.
