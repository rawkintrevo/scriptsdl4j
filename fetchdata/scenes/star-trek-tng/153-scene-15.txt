[Jeremy's quarters]

(Jeremy is watching family movies on a personal
monitor) 
JEREMY [OC]: Captain Patches, an alien ship on the surface. What's it
made of, Captain. Oh, no, we've been hit, Captain. We're going down. 
DAD [OC]: That was great. Now, let's get a shot of mom. 
MARLA [on monitor]: What are you doing? I'll turn your lens into
(something) shards. Go away! Go away! Go away! Over there. Over there. 
(And the camera swings round to young Jeremy holding a kitten) 
JEREMY [on monitor]: Patches. Captain Patches is coming in for a
landing on the sofa! 
(The doorbell chimes) 
JEREMY [OC]: Oh, no, he's going to crash. 
WORF: Jeremy Aster? I'm Lieutenant Worf. May I enter? 
JEREMY: You were in command of the away team. 
WORF: Yes. I was with Lieutenant Aster, your mother, when she died. 
JEREMY: You're a Klingon, aren't you. 
WORF: Yes. 
JEREMY: We studied about Klingons in school. 
WORF: What did they teach you about us? 
JEREMY: You used to be our enemies. 
WORF: Did they also teach you that every Klingon hopes to die in the
line of duty as your mother did? In my tradition, we do not grieve the
loss of the body. We celebrate the releasing of the spirit. 
JEREMY: I understand death. They teach us all about it. 
WORF: Jeremy Aster, we may both understand it, but we must bring
meaning to your mother's death. Perhaps we can do it together.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. Counsellor, how's the boy? 
TROI: He's being very brave. 
PICARD: Good. 
TROI: No, he has to get past brave. He's very angry and he has to learn
how to express that anger before he can really say goodbye to his
mother. 
PICARD: How can we help? 
TROI: Well, I've asked Beverly if we might get Wesley to talk to Jeremy
about his father's death. The one unusual element is Worf. 
PICARD: Oh? 
TROI: In many ways he's suffering as badly as the boy. He wishes to
involve Jeremy in a Klingon ceremony called R'uustai, the Bonding 
PICARD: I know of that. Perhaps it will be helpful to both of them. 
TROI: I don't think Jeremy's ready to accept Worf right now. Perhaps
later, but it will have to be handled most delicately. 
PICARD: As you always do. I break the unpleasant news and there my
responsibility ends, but you, you have to stay with them through the
entire grieving process. 
TROI: We deal with our pain in many different ways, but over the years
I've discovered it is in our joy that the uniqueness of each individual
is revealed. If I can help a person back to a state of joy, well, my
role has its rewards. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we're picking up an energy field on the planet
surface. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Location? 
RIKER: Two kilometres north of the away team's beam-down point. 
PICARD: Indeed? Full scan. 
DATA: Inconclusive, Captain. 
TROI: Sir, I', sensing a presence on the planet. Very vague. 
PICARD: Life form? 
TROI: I can't be sure. The emotions of the crew are particularly strong
right now. It's difficult to filter them out. 
PICARD: Data, scan analysis on main viewer. 
(Something looks as if it is streaming off the planet) 
[Crusher's office]

WESLEY: Hi. 
CRUSHER: Hi. Troi stopped by a little while ago. She was wondering if
you might be willing to talk to Jeremy Aster at some point. 
WESLEY: Me? What for? 
CRUSHER: About your Dad. 
WESLEY: What am I going to tell him? 
CRUSHER: It would help him to talk with someone who's been through
this. We had each other, Wes. He doesn't have anyone to lean on right
now. And he might be more comfortable talking to someone who's not much
older than he is. 
WESLEY: Okay, I'll think about it. 
CRUSHER: Okay. 
WESLEY: Do you ever think about him, Mom? 
CRUSHER: Your father? Sure I do. 
WESLEY: Sometimes I can't even remember what his face looks like. It
scares me. 
CRUSHER: It happens to all of us, Wes. Sometimes I can't get his face
out of my mind. 
WESLEY: Today, today it's like I can see it all as clearly as if it
were yesterday. I can remember the way Dad looked when he hugged me
goodbye. Captain Picard's eyes when he came to tell us 
(Beverly reaches for her son. They're both close to tears)
