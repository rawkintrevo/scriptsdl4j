[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Data enters) 
PICARD: Data, Captain Louvois has issued a ruling. You are the property
of Starfleet Command. You can not resign. 
DATA: I see. From limitless options I am reduced to none, or rather
one. I can only hope that Commander Maddox is more capable than it
would appear. 
PICARD: Data, you're not going to submit. We're going to fight this. I
challenged the ruling. Captain Louvois will be compelled to hold a
hearing. She may be overly attached to the letter of the law, but I
suspect that she still understands its spirit. We will put to rest this
question of your legal status once and for all. Now, I have been asked
to represent you, but if there is some other officer with which you
would feel more happy? 
DATA: Captain, I have complete confidence in your ability to represent
my interests.

(Then up pops 'emergency manual control' and Data's off-switch location
is displayed. Riker is fascinated at this new information, then
realises the implication)
