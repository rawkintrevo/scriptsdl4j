[Corridor]

(The light pops up through the floor, hides from
them follow a couple of crew, and goes up into crew quarters. It seems
to examine one man asleep, then passes through a bulkhead, goes
underneath the sheets and into Deanna Troi, who wakes up panting)

Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1. There has been an
outbreak of an unclassified plasma plague in the Rachelis system. We
are on an emergency run to collect specimens of the deadly plague and
transport them to Science Station Tango Sierra, where hopefully an
antidote can be produced.

[Turbolift]

(Wesley has come out of the lift and gone straight
back in with Picard) 
PICARD: Deck ten, forward station one. 
WESLEY: Hello, Captain. 
PICARD: Ensign. I'm sorry this mission will delay your reunion with
your mother. 
WESLEY: That's all right. That will give me the time to finish some
projects I have to do. It's going to be hard leaving the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Mixed feelings for all of us. It's always difficult leaving any
ship, just as it was for your mother
