PICARD VASH VASH [OC] CREWMAN
head liar doorbell embarrassed going contrary known ruins came

[Corridor]

CREWMAN: Captain. 
(The crewman goes round the corner, there's no one else in sight, so
Picard rings a doorbell) 
VASH [OC]: Who's there? 
PICARD: It's me. 
VASH [OC]: Who? 
PICARD: Jean-Luc. 
[Vash's quarters]

VASH: Yes? 
PICARD: May I come in? 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Let me try to explain. I am by no means embarrassed by your
presence here. On the contrary. 
(then he spots a PADD on a table) 
PICARD: What's this? A map of the ruins? I thought that I was the only
reason you came to Tagus. 
VASH: I never fooled you for a second. Still, you are the most
important reason. 
PICARD: Am I? 
VASH: That's the trouble with being such a well-known liar. Even when
I'm telling the truth, no one believes me. 
(Picard goes into the next room and comes out with a shovel and
something else) 
PICARD: This equipment will have to be confiscated. 
VASH: Is that necessary? 
PICARD: If the Taguans were to catch you down there. 
VASH: Oh, come on. You gave me the same warning about Sarathong Five. 
PICARD: I remember. 
VASH: Well, it didn't stop me from going there. I brought back some
very impressive artefacts, too. 
PICARD: Which no doubt you sold for a very impressive profit. 
VASH: That's what I do! 
PICARD: Not on board my ship. I will not allow it. 
VASH: Let's get one thing straight, though, Picard. I cannot change who
I am for you or anyone else. 
PICARD: Nor can I change who I am. 
VASH: Then we have nothing more to say to one another. 
PICARD: So it would seem. 
(Picard leaves, and Q pokes his head through the hull)
