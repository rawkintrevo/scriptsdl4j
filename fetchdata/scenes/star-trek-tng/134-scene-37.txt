[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: We have to know what's going on 
[Bridge]

PICARD: And Commander Riker is the only one who can
tell us. Beam him directly here onto the Bridge 
[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: On my command. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, sir. I'll wait till forty thousand. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Forty eight thousand. Forty four thousand. 
PICARD: Transporter Room, stand by. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: You control the shields.
O'BRIEN: Ready, sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Forty thousand.

[Pagh Bridge]

(Captain Kargan is beamed away) 
RIKER: Hold where you are, Klag. I've relieved Captain Kargan. He was
acting in an irrational manner. I'm your Captain now. Serve this ship
as I have!

[Bridge]

KARGAN: Where am I? 
PICARD: You're on board the starship Enterprise. 
KARGAN: Riker has no honour. He tricked me! 
(He turns to shoot Picard, but Worf shoots him first) 
DATA: He's only dazed, sir. 
PICARD: Well that's fine, but where's Commander Riker?

[Pagh Bridge]

RIKER: Cloaking shields off. Obey my orders. 
TACTICS: We will be destroyed. 
RIKER: If we are, it will be in battle, and I will die with you. So I
repeat, cloaking shields off!
