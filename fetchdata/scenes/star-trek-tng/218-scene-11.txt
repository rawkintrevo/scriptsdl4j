PICARD: Report. 
RO: Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon until we were almost on top of
it, sir. 
WORF: It is a highly localised distortion of the space-time continuum. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(the blue swirly, as before) 
PICARD: Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow. 
RO: Aye sir. Captain, manoeuvreing thrusters are not responding. 
DATA: The distortion field is fluctuating.

rapidly. 
RIKER: Red alert.
