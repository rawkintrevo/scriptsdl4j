PICARD: Affirmative, Number One. Are you ready? 
[Engineering]

RIKER: We are.
PICARD [OC]: La Forge, set in warp one point five.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Warp one point five, sir. 
PICARD: Engage.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: All right, here we go. 
(Wesley watches the Traveller make adjustments on his console, while
Kosinski taps at him. The Traveller turns to smile at Wesley) 
KOSINSKI: What are you doing? 
(Consternation. The warp core appears to be racing. The Traveller puts
his hands on the console and partially vanishes. The Enterprise takes
off at ridiculous speed)

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Captain, we're passing warp ten! 
(The viewscreen looks like the opening credits to Doctor Who. There's a
jolt which throws the Traveller off his stool. Kosinski is clueless) 
PICARD: What is our velocity? 
DATA: It's off the scale, sir. 
PICARD: Reverse engines. 
DATA: Captain, no one has ever reversed engines at this velocity. 
PICARD: Because no one has gone this fast. Reverse engines. 
(They arrive at a beautiful place) 
PICARD: All stop. 
LAFORGE: Reading all stop, sir. 
PICARD: Position? 
LAFORGE: Calculating it, sir. Data, what do you read there? 
DATA: Malfunction, I trust. 
PICARD: Position, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Well, sir, according to these calculations, we've not only
left our own galaxy, but passed through
two others, ending up on the far side of Triangulum. The galaxy known
as M Thirty Three. 
PICARD: That's not possible. Data, what distance have we travelled? 
DATA: Two million seven hundred thousand light years. 
PICARD: I can't accept that. 
DATA: You must, sir. Our comparisons show it to be completely accurate.

LAFORGE: And I calculate that at maximum warp, sir it would take over
three hundred years to get home. 

Captain's log, stardate 41263.2. This will be a
rather unusual log entry, assuming Starfleet ever receives it. As I
have already informed my crew, a phenomenal surge of power during a
warp speed experiment has sent our starship hurtling out of our own
galaxy, past another, taking us over two million seven hundred thousand
light years in a few minutes.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Message on this has been transmitted to
Starfleet, sir. 
DATA: Which, traveling subspace, they should receive in fifty-one
years, ten months nine weeks, sixteen days 
PICARD: Mister Data! 
DATA: Sir? 
(Kosinski, Riker and Argyle enter) 
KOSINSKI: Captain Picard, I presume? 
RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir. 
KOSINSKI: The truth is, Captain, I made a mistake. A wonderful,
incredible mistake. 
PICARD: Just explain what brought us here. 
KOSINSKI: As the power grew, I applied the energy asymptomatically. I
anticipated some tilling, but it didn't occur. Now that was my error,
using the Bessel functions at the beginning. 
PICARD: What is he saying, Number One? 
RIKER: To tell the truth, sir, it sounds to me like nonsense to me. But
considering 
PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't.

WESLEY: Can I do something to help? I can call my
mother. She's a doctor. 
TRAVELLER: No, there's nothing she can do. I need to rest. I've been
away too long. 
WESLEY: What happened to you, is it part of what happened to the ship? 
TRAVELLER: Please believe me, I mean no harm to this vessel or those in
it. 
WESLEY: Is Mister Kosinski like he sounds? A joke? 
TRAVELLER: No, that's too cruel. He has sensed some small part of it 
WESLEY: That space and time and thought aren't the separate things they
appear to be? I just thought the formula you were using said something
like that. 
TRAVELLER: Boy, don't ever say that again. And especially not at your
age in a world that's not ready for such, such dangerous nonsense.
