[Warbird ward room]

TORETH: We'd been told that the Klingon outpost was
undefended. So when their warships decloaked, they took us completely
by surprise. 
(Troi enters) 
TORETH: The Klingons managed to destroyed half my squadron before we
even opened fire. But when we did, ha! they were no match for us. I
destroyed their flagship myself. I received the Sotaric Citation for my
actions that day. The Intelligence Officer in charge of that mission
was executed. Major. Welcome to our table. 
TROI: Commander. 
TORETH: I suggest you try the viinerine. It's quite good. 
(Troi takes a bowl and spoons some stuff out onto her plate) 
TORETH: I realise that it's nothing compared to what you're accustomed
to on Romulus, but you could at least try the viinerine. 
TROI: I've smelled better viinerine on prison ships. 
TORETH: No doubt. Tell me, Major, where did you train? The Intelligence
Academy or the Imperial War College? 
TROI: The Academy. 
TORETH: Oh? So you must know Commander Konsab. 
TROI: I know of him. 
TORETH: I assume you studied Military History with him? 
TROI: Yes. 
TORETH: Tell me, Major, what do you think about his theories on the
differences between the military and the Tal Shiar? 
TROI: Which aspects are you referring to? 
TORETH: Come now, Major. Surely you attended his classes regularly? It
was Konsab's main theme. 
TROI: Do you have a point to make, Commander? If so, it has escaped me.

TORETH: Commander Konsab believes that in order to function, military
officers have to trust each other. The Tal Shiar, on the other hand,
trust no one. They expect deception, so they always find it. 
TROI: Your opinion of the Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander. 
TORETH: I hope so. 
TROI: We ensure the loyalty of the people. Do you believe the Empire
would be better off without our protection? 
TORETH: Protection? From what? How was the Empire threatened by the
words of an old man, a devoted citizen who merely tried to speak his
mind? How did the Tal Shiar protect the Empire by dragging him, my
father, out of his home in the middle of the night? 
TROI: Clearly, your father was a traitor. 
TORETH: No. He was just an idealistic old man. I never saw him again. 
TROI: I don't need your devotion, Commander. Just your obedience. 
TORETH: And that's all you have. 
GUEST2 [OC]: Commander, sensors are picking up an unidentified ship on
an intercept course.
