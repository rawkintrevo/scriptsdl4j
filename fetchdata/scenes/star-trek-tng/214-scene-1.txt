TROI CRUSHER DATA KRISTIN

[Ten Forward]

(a 3D chess game is in progress) 
DATA: The characteristic response to the Kriskov Gambit is to counter
with the el-Mitra Exchange, particularly since I have already taken
both your rooks. By missing that opportunity, you have left your king
vulnerable. 
TROI: We'll see. 
DATA: As you wish, Counsellor. Check. 
(Troi makes her move) 
DATA: Intriguing. You have devised a completely unanticipated response
to a classic attack. You will checkmate my king in seven moves. 
TROI: Data, chess isn't just a game of ploys and gambits. It's a game
of intuition. 
DATA: You are a challenging opponent, Counsellor. 
TROI: Thanks, but don't think a compliment's going to get you out of
our bet. You owe me one Samarian Sunset made in the traditional style,
as only you can make it, Data. 
DATA: I will honour our agreement.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Raise your arm to the side. 
(it barely gets to waist height) 
CRUSHER: Is that it? 
KRISTIN: I'm afraid so. What do you think? 
CRUSHER: Well, it looks like you tucked when you should have flattened
out. 
KRISTIN: Something like that. 
CRUSHER: Turn your head to the left. Some tearing of the ligaments.
Nothing we can't take care of. 
KRISTIN: Good. 
CRUSHER: If I remember correctly, the last time you graced my Sickbay,
you were diving off the Cliffs of Heaven on Sumiko Four. Holodeck
programme 47C. 
KRISTIN: Same thing. Only that time, I flattened out when I should have
tucked. 
CRUSHER: Well, as your Doctor, I would like to recommend the Emerald
Wading Pool on Cirrus Four. It's a lot safer.
