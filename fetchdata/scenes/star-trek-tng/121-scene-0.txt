TROI LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD RIKER DATA SALESMAN

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One? 
RIKER: No help from their communications log. The Drake reported
arriving at Minos and then wasn't heard from again. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: The citizens of Minos gained fame during the Ersalrope wars as
arms merchants. They manufactured sophisticated and highly advanced
weaponry. 
LAFORGE: Yeah? For which side? 
DATA: Both. 
LAFORGE: We are approaching the planet Minos, sir. 
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. Standard orbit. 
RIKER: Whatever happened to the Drake, happened quickly, otherwise a
man like Rice would have reported again. 
PICARD: You know Captain Rice? 
RIKER: We were at the Academy together. 
PICARD: Tell me about him. 
RIKER: Able. A good officer. 
TROI: How would he react under stress? 
RIKER: Paul Rice is confident to the point of arrogance, he but carries
it well because he's usually right. He's a risk taker. 
PICARD: Really? 
RIKER: I'll give you an example. One of the final tests in advance
navigation at the Academy provides the student with three options. Rice
was given this test, rejected their options and offered one of his own.

PICARD: That's taking a risk. 
RIKER: And it paid off. He received the top grade and now that same
test has four options. 
TROI: In a difficult situation a man like that would act aggressively. 
RIKER: Agreed. 
WORF: Commander, weren't you offered the Drake? 
RIKER: Yes. 
TASHA: You gave up your own command to take this assignment? 
RIKER: At the time I thought it would be more advantageous for me to do
a tour on the Enterprise. 
DATA: Captain, readings correspond with the findings of the probe. No
signs of intelligent life forms. Vegetation and animal life only. 
TROI: What happened to all the people? 
WORF: War? 
DATA: Disease? 
LAFORGE: A dissatisfied customer? 
TASHA: In any war, natural disaster, even the most virulent plague,
there are always survivors. 
DATA: Captain, we are being hailed. 
RIKER: How can that be from a planet with no people? 
PICARD: Your sensors indicated no intelligent life forms? 
DATA: Correct, sir. Something has scanned our language banks and is
hailing us. 
PICARD: On main viewer. 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Whoever you are, wherever you're from,
greetings. Welcome to Minos, the arsenal of freedom. 
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: If you need a little something special, be it
for one target or multiple targets, we got it. You'll see it here on
Minos, where we live by the motto 'peace through superior firepower'. 
PICARD: To whom am I speaking? 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: To be totally armed is to be totally secure.
Remember, the early bird that hesitates gets wormed. 
DATA: It is a recorded message, sir. 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: Minos, the arsenal of freedom. Perfection in
highly advanced weaponry. Versatility. 
PICARD: We must have triggered something left over from the Erselrope
wars when the arms business was booming. 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: So lock on to my signal and beam on down,
because we don't just provide weapons 
PICARD: Shut that off. 
SALESMAN [on viewscreen]: We provide complete weapons systems. 
LAFORGE: It's a heck of a sales pitch. 
PICARD: If an automated message system is still functioning, there
could be other systems on that planet that are still operational. 
TASHA: Weapons systems? 
PICARD: Possibly. 
RIKER: We're going to have to go down there to find it. 
PICARD: Number One, prepare am away team. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Yar. Data. 
TASHA: Commander, I recommend a minimum complement. 
RIKER: Oh? I would have thought otherwise. 
TASHA: We'll keep the first landing party small and mobile, until I'm
confident that whatever killed the inhabitants of this planet isn't
still down there. 
RIKER: Okay.
