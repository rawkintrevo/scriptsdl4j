  [Graveyard]

(What looks like a traditional British church and churchyard, with people wearing plaid sashes over their tweeds, and a bell
tolling) 
CRUSHER: Most people on this colony will remember my grandmother as a
healer, but her abilities went beyond that. She didn't just relieve
pain and fight illness. She knew that wellbeing is more than a healthy
body. Her remedies often included words of advice as well as medicinal
teas, and often they were just as bitter tasting. I will miss Felisa
Howard very much. Her healing, her advice, and most of all, the
inspiration she has provided me throughout the years. Rest in peace,
Nana. 
GUEST0: (not human) And so now we commit her body to the ground, earth
to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope that
her memory will be kept alive within us all. 
ALL: Amen. 
(most people through soil onto the coffin, but one man throws a
camellia. A little later, after the titles) 
TROI: That was a beautiful. 
CRUSHER: Oh, thank you. Deanna, did you notice a strange man at the
service? He was in his mid-thirties with longish hair? 
TROI: No. 
CRUSHER: He threw a flower on Nana's grave. A camellia. It was her
favourite flower. She used to keep them all over the house. 
TROI: Maybe he was a friend or one of her patients. 
CRUSHER: It was a very personal gesture, and he gave me a remarkable
look. Well, I guess I should be going back to the house. There are some
things I need to do. It's only a few minutes from here. Would you mind
coming along? 
TROI: I'd love to. 
CRUSHER: Thanks. 
GUEST0: How long do you plan on staying? 
PICARD: A few more hours. Why? 
GUEST0: Well, as you know, Caldos is one of the first terraforming
projects of the Federation. Our weather controls and fusion systems are
nearly a century old. I wouldn't mind having a starship Engineer take a
look at them. Perhaps give us a few upgrades. Maybe in exchange for a
tour of the colony and a home-cooked meal? 
PICARD: Well, we are due at Starbase six two one tomorrow morning, but
we could delay for a few days. Yes, I'm sure we could find the time. 
GUEST0: Excellent. 
PICARD: I would enjoy that tour. Caldos Colony is a most impressive
accomplishment. I actually feel as if I'm in the Scottish Highlands. 
GUEST0: That was the intent. The cornerstone of every building in town
was brought from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen. The founders wanted
everyone to feel they had a piece of the real thing here. They didn't
want to just imitate Scotland, they wanted to recreate it. 
PICARD: Tell me, Governor, I'm curious. You're obviously not Scots
yourself. What was it that drew you here? 
GUEST0: Something about the culture, the heritage. When I was a boy,
my family visited Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I looked out across the
highlands, I felt as if I had come home.
