REPORTER: Thanks for your help, officer. 
POLICEMAN: Now, be sure you put in the part about me spotting that
phony policeman. 
REPORTER: Yes, sir. 
CLEMENS: Hello, son. 
REPORTER: Mister Clemens. What brings you here? 
CLEMENS: Writer's curiosity. I heard that two people vanished into thin
air in this Infirmary. 
REPORTER: One of the patients said that, yes, sir, but the police deny
it. 
CLEMENS: I bet they do. 
REPORTER: They say a band of outlaws set off an explosion in the
hospital and then escaped. 
CLEMENS: Well, what did these outlaws look like? 
REPORTER: The carriage they escaped in was driven by an albino. 
CLEMENS: Oh. Mister Data. 
REPORTER: You know him? 
CLEMENS: You bet I do. You say there were others with him? 
REPORTER: Yes, at least a dozen. 
CLEMENS: His accomplices. They've come from the future. My God, it's an
invasion. 
(he hails a cab) 
REPORTER: An invasion from the future? Mister Clemens, what can you
tell me about this? Do you have any proof? 
CLEMENS: When's your deadline, boy? 
REPORTER: Five o'clock, sir. 
CLEMENS: I'll meet you at your paper at four thirty with a story that
will make your career. 
REPORTER: Thanks, Mister Clemens 
CLEMENS: Take me to the Presidio, driver, and don't spare the whip.
