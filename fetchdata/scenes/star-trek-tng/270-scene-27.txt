sees dna work needed bulkhead thanks supplies synthesised clearly

[Sickbay]

 CRUSHER: I've synthesised the inhibitor. Please
come to Sickbay whenever you're ready. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Acknowledged. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Worf, here. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Medical supplies are ready to be taken to cargo bay for
transport. 
WORF: I will be there shortly. 
[Sickbay]

(Deanna gets her shot) 
CRUSHER: This should take effect immediately. 
TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? 
CRUSHER: It's hard to say for sure, but I can always increase the
dosage if it's not enough. 
(Worf enters with Calloway) 
WORF: The cargo bay will be off limits to all but medical personnel. 
CALLOWAY: Thanks for your help, sir. 
WORF: You're welcome. 
TROI: Good morning. 
WORF: Counsellor. 
TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? 
WORF: Yes. 
CALLOWAY: Excuse me, sir. About the quarantine field in the cargo bay?
It looks like we'll need a second field generator. 
WORF: I am needed here. I will join you as soon as I can. 
TROI: All right. 
WORF: Apparently my help was not so good after all. 
CALLOWAY: Yes, it was. You were wonderful. 
WORF: I think I know what's wrong. 
[Nacelle control]

LAFORGE: Counsellor, you okay? 
TROI: I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to be working. Have you found
anything? 
LAFORGE: No, nothing unusual. 
TROI: I don't remember seeing these during my empathic experience. Have
they been here since the ship was built? 
DATA: No, they were installed two years ago. 
(Troi goes up the ladder to the nacelle proper) 
TROI: Geordi, I remember seeing a plasma conduit right there. 
LAFORGE: The main ODN line runs right behind that panel. It lifts out
so you can get to it. 
NARA: Kwan was working on that conduit the day before he died. 
TROI: Can you open it? 
LAFORGE: Sure. It'll take just a minute. 
(he goes downstairs.) 
LAFORGE: Data. 
TROI: Lieutenant Nara, may I ask you something? The work Lieutenant
Kwan was doing, was it unusual in any way? 
NARA: He was refitting a field coil, but it was probably the first time
that particular panel's been opened since the ship was built. 
TROI: Thank you. 
[Injector room]

(Geordi removes the panel) 
WOMAN: No! 
(Troi sees Pierce in his UP coverall) 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, are you all right? 
TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's something
in there. 
DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in
this wall. 
LAFORGE: Organic? You're right. Let me reconfigure the emitter beam. We
might be able to see what it is. There. 
(skull, ribcage, spine)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This dosage should prevent any further
empathic flashes. 
CALLOWAY: The bone fragments are definitely human. I sequenced a DNA
sample. I'll see if I can match it to Starfleet records. 
(Worf goes to stand over Calloway at the console) 
CALLOWAY: Accessing Starfleet personnel records. 
(Worf and Calloway talk under the dialogue, and Troi keeps looking at
them) 
CRUSHER: I'd say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or
eight years. You said something happened when the panel was opened. 
TROI: Yes. 
CRUSHER: I wonder if the fragments themselves could have somehow
triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything
turns up. 
CALLOWAY: Sir, I think we've found a match. 
WORF: Apparently the remains are those of an Ensign Marla Finn. 
CALLOWAY: I'm trying to find a picture of her in the records. 
TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw. 
CRUSHER: It says she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on
stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago. But how did her body become embedded
in a bulkhead? 
CALLOWAY: Maybe there was some kind of an accident. 
WORF: Or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains. 
TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after
Finn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes. 
CRUSHER: Then whose? 
TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic. 
WORF: Pierce? 
CRUSHER: But you saw him there. 
TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His face
looked like that. 
CRUSHER: A reflection. 
TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get away
from him. She was afraid of him. 
WORF: I think it is time we had another conversation with Lieutenant
Pierce. Ensign Calloway, thank you for your help.
