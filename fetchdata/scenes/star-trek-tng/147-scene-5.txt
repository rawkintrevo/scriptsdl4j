PICARD RIKER KOLRAMI WORF WESLEY

[Worf's
quarters]

(He
seems to be building a
matchstick ship, The door
chime makes him break a
stick.)
WORF:
Enter! 
RIKER: Am I disturbing you? 
(Worf sweeps the wreckage off the desk)
WORF: Just finished. 
RIKER: You know of the simulation. What do you think? 
WORF: Waste of time. 
RIKER: It's just designed to be an exercise. 
WORF: Useless. If there is nothing to lose, no sacrifice, then there is
nothing to gain. 
RIKER: You mean besides pride. Well, in this case it doesn't matter. I
probably haven't got a chance. 
WORF: There is always a chance. 
RIKER: Slim. The Hathaway's most sophisticated weapon system, even in a
computer mock-up, can't hope to defeat the Enterprise. 
WORF: Well, still 
RIKER: You're out-manned, you're out-gunned, you're out-equipped. What
else have you got? 
WORF: Guile. 
RIKER: Join me. 
WORF: The honour is to serve.

PICARD:
Begin long-range scanning
of all sectors within three
light years of Braslota. How
is your crew shaping up? 
RIKER:
It's complete, but I would like to request an addition. 
PICARD: Anyone in particular? 
RIKER: With your permission, I would like Acting Ensign Crusher aboard
for educational observation. 
(Picard nods) 
WESLEY: Thank you, Captain. 
(Wesley leaves) 
RIKER: It appears we will have some time before reaching Braslota. I
was wondering if you'd agree to play me in a game of Strategema. 
KOLRAMI: Although I am intrigued by the audacity of your request, I
can't fathom why you wish the encounter. 
RIKER: I enjoy a challenge. 
KOLRAMI: Very well. An opponent of limited dimensions can often be
quite diverting. 
RIKER: Thank you.
