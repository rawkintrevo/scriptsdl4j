[Council chambers]

RIKER: It's almost time. I want the boy brought
here now. 
(Liator get up) 
TASHA: I'll go along with you. 
GUEST4: Of course. 
(Picard and Crusher beam in. Rivan goes over and kneels, handing back
his communicator) 
GUEST5: Captain Picard. I saw you share the sky with God. You must be
Gods. 
PICARD: No, no, we're not gods. 
(Wesley enters, escorted by the two mediators, Liator and Tasha) 
WESLEY: Mother. I guess you know a lot has happened here. 
CRUSHER: I know. 
WESLEY: Captain Picard, are you going to let them kill me? 
PICARD: No. But I must find some way to prevent it that you understand.

GUEST0: How can we let this happen, Liator? They threaten everything
we respect. Our law, our peace, our tranquillity and order. 
GUEST0 2: You are powerful, but do not do this to us, we beg you. At
least study what we were without law. Hurtful to each other, savage,
thieving. 
PICARD: I understand. Perhaps your system of law and punishment is
better than any system we once had. But we do now have a law I must
obey. And part of it says I must protect my people from harm. 
GUEST4: We did not ask you to come here. 
RIKER: Which has to do with another law that we must obey. 
PICARD: We are all sworn not to interfere with other lives in the
galaxy. If I save this boy, I break that law. 
GUEST0: And you should be executed if you do so! 
PICARD: I may suffer almost as much. Starfleet takes the Prime
Directive very seriously. 
GUEST0 2: No, it is God who will punish you. 
PICARD: That thought has crossed our minds. Your god up there may
insist that we obey our non-interference directive. 
WESLEY: Sir, does this mean if you save me the entire crew could die? 
PICARD: You're not involved in this decision, boy. 
WESLEY: I'm sorry, sir, but it seems like I am. 
PICARD: Picard to Transporter room. Lock into this signal. Stand by for
six to beam up. Wesley, Lieutenant. 
(The Starfleet people gather together) 
GUEST4: Our laws have been violated. What of justice? 
TASHA: What of justice to Wesley? Does he deserve to die? 
PICARD: I'm truly sorry, Liator, but I must have justice for my people
too. Transporter room, energise. 
(Nothing happens) 
PICARD: Transporter room, come in. 
CHIEF [OC]: We can't energise the beam, sir. Everything checks out but
we're getting no results. 
GUEST0: God has prevented your escape. 
CRUSHER: Then your god is unfair. My son had no warning that his act
was criminal. 
GUEST0 2: We cannot allow ignorance of the law to become a defence. 
PICARD: I don't know how to communicate this, or even if it is
possible, but the question of justice has concerned me greatly of
lately. And I say to any creature who may be listening, there can be no
justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise
in exceptions. 
RIKER: When has justice ever been as simple as a rulebook? 
(The party are beamed up) 
PICARD: It seems the Edo Lord agrees with you, Number One.
