MAN: This will please you. Join us. 
RIKER: Thanks. Another time. 
WOMAN: Joy and happiness. 
RIKER: It certainly is. The good life, Worf. 
WORF: I am not concerned with pleasure, Commander. I am a warrior. 
RIKER: Even Klingons need love now and then. 
WORF: For what we consider love, sir, I would need a Klingon woman. 
RIKER: What about plain old basic sex? You must have some need for
that. 
WORF: Of course, but with the females available to me, sir, Earth
females, I must restrain myself too much. They are quite fragile, sir. 
RIKER: Worf, if anyone else had said that, I'd suspect he was bragging.

WORF: Bragging, sir? 
RIKER: I think I'll pass on that. I'd better check in. Enterprise, come
in. Captain, do you read me? Let's. This may be nothing, but let's move
all our people together. 
WORF: Including Wesley, the boy? He's outside. 
TROI: Is there a problem? 
RIKER: We've lost contact with our ship. 
TROI: It's nothing these people have done. I'm certain of that. Their
minds are so open. 
RIKER: Help me locate Wes. He's wandered off. 
(Riker and Troi leave. Worf goes over to Tasha, who is with Rivan and
Liator) 
TASHA: That is extraordinary. 
WORF: Can I take a moment of your time, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Yes, Worf, but you've got to hear this. Are you telling me that
there's no crime here whatsoever? No one breaks any laws? 
LIATOR: Once they did. Long, long ago there was much disorder. But not
now. 
TASHA: But I seen no sign of police. Those who enforce laws. 
RIVAN: Oh, we have very few. They are called Mediators. And they are
needed only in one place each day. 
LIATOR: The punishment zone. An area that's selected for a period of
time. 
TASHA: It's a completely random selection? 
LIATOR: No one but our Mediators know what place or for how long. We're
very proud of the wisdom of our ancestors. No person ever knows where
or when a zone will be. 
RIVAN: And so no one risks death. 
WORF: Death? 
RIVAN: by breaking any law. 
TASHA: Wait. Explain this. 
LIATOR: Only one punishment for any crime. 
WORF: Anyone who commits any crime in the punishment zone dies? 
LIATOR: The law is the law. Our peace is built on that. 
TASHA: Even a small thing? Such as ignoring the rule, keep off the
grass? 
RIVAN: Then no one breaks that rule. Who wants to risk execution? And
there's always a white wall or fence to remind anyone of a forbidden
area like that. 
TASHA: And just who tells visitors about these rules? 
WORF: We'd better find Wesley.

[Planet surface]

(The children are running and laughing near
cold-frames, nicely marked out with low white fences around them, and
throwing the ball back and forth) 
GIRL: You're very clever at this. 
WESLEY: At home we play a lot of it. Here, toss the ball ahead of me. 
(A boy does, and Wesley runs back to catch it, not watching where he is
going) 
GIRL: No, Wes! 
BOY: No! It's forbidden to disturb new plants! 
(But Wesley jumps to catch the ball, and clears the fence, smashing
into the cold frame) 
BOY: Couldn't you see the fence? It's for new plants. Don't ever go
past a white marker. 
WESLEY: It's okay. I'm fine. 
(Two burley men come running) 
GIRL: Oh, no! Oh, please, no! 
MEDIATOR 2: Speak the truth. We are mediators. 
WESLEY: I said I was fine. 
GIRL: He doesn't know. He's from another place. 
MEDIATOR 2: How very sad. But this zone has been selected. 
BOY: But he doesn't understand. 
MEDIATOR: It's always sad. Now doubly so. 
(Riker and Troi arrive) 
WESLEY: I was chasing a ball and I fell into that. I'm really sorry! 
MEDIATOR: You admit you did that? Freely? 
WESLEY: I'm with Starfleet. We don't lie. 
RIKER: It won't happen again. We apologise. 
MEDIATOR: We're sorry, too. But that changes nothing. 
(Tasha and Worf arrive) 
TASHA: Careful, Commander. They've got some strange laws here. 
RIKER: I thought you reviewed their laws. 
TASHA: But they listed nothing about punishment. 
MEDIATOR: One moment, please. Is there a witness to this transgression?

BOY: But it was my fault. I threw the ball past him. 
MEDIATOR: We have a visible transgression, ample witnesses, and an
admission of guilt. And though it deeply pains us to do it, we must. 
(He takes a small hypodermic needle from his belt pouch) 
MEDIATOR: Are you prepared for punishment? 
WORF: Punishment? If you mean what the others were talking about. 
RIKER: What punishment? Name it! 
MEDIATOR: Death, of course. Don't make it difficult for the boy. 
(The other mediator goes to take Wesley, and Riker knocks him down.
Tasha and Worf draw their phasers) 
WORF: Drop it. Drop it now! 
(He drops the needle and Tasha picks it up) 
TASHA: It's a kind of syringe. 
RIKER: What is this? You said death. Is this poison? 
MEDIATOR: But of course it is. Completely painless. The boy would have
felt nothing. But look at him now. You've frightened him. 
WESLEY: He was going to kill me? 
MEDIATOR 2: And if this Zone were still in effect, you would all
deserve death. 
MEDIATOR: It was announced you came as friends. Is this how friends
act? 
RIKER: Enterprise from away team, come in. Are you receiving us,
Enterprise?

[Bridge]

(Doctor Crusher is examining Data, who still has
the globe attached to him) 
PICARD: Condition? 
CRUSHER: No sign of consciousness, but the balance of the readings are
quite normal for him. 
PICARD: I believe this is some form of information exchange with
whatever is over there. At least, I hope it is. 
CRUSHER: Any communication from the away team? 
PICARD: Something is blocking communication both 
(The globe leaves Data, then vanishes) 
TASHA [OC]: Security. Urgent. Repeating. Enterprise from away team. 
LAFORGE: This is the Enterprise, Lieutenant. We're receiving you now. 
TASHA [OC]: This is an urgent call for Captain Picard. 
RIKER [OC]: We may need your presence here, Captain. We have serious
trouble with a member of our away team and an unusual law they have
here. 
PICARD: Captain to Riker, stand by. Signs of consciousness? 
CRUSHER: Not yet. Could be minutes or hours. It's unclear what's
happened to him. 
PICARD: Take him to Sickbay. Let me know the instant he's awake.
Anything new on that that thing out there? 
LAFORGE: Negative, sir. 
PICARD: Captain to First Officer. I'm beaming down.

[Council Chambers]

PICARD: Would you care to comment privately how you
read any of this? 
TROI: Unnecessary, sir. These people are honest, almost to a fault. And
they have great pride in their ways. 
LIATOR: You're the Captain. We're ready. This way, please. 
(Benches have been arranged in a circle. Picard has a chair to himself)

LIATOR: Welcome to our world, Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
LIATOR: We regret that our system of justice is troubling you. 
PICARD: The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? 
RIKER: In accord with the Prime Directive, I've allowed them to hold
him pending the outcome of this. 
RIVAN: He is safe and unharmed. We promise that. Captain Picard, I do
not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you
respect such things. 
PICARD: We do. 
LIATOR: Good, so do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long
ago. The tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by
our laws. 
RIVAN: We are a people of law. They do sometimes bring us sadness, but
we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. 
PICARD: They haven't always, but now they do. 
LIATOR: Do you execute criminals? 
PICARD: No, not any longer. 
RIVAN: But you did once? 
PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then 
RIVAN: But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? 
PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned to
detect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in our
world, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. 
LIATOR: So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are
advanced in other ways too, I suggest you use your superior powers to
rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal out
of our reach, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of
this backward little world. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. 
RIVAN: Riker has explained it to us. 
PICARD: Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? 
LIATOR: Until sundown? 
RIVAN: Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the
law. But we must act by sundown. 
PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circling
high above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object.
A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real.
At least, it's not completely solid. 
RIVAN: Do you mean God? 
PICARD: God? 
LIATOR: God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. 
PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? 
RIVAN: As you just did. As existing both here and in another place
also. 
LIATOR: But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt
most fully. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, come in please. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
BEVERLY [OC]: CMO Crusher, sir.
