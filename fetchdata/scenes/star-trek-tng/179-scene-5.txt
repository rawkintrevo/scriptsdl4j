[Quaice's quarters]

CRUSHER: Dalen? Dalen, it's Beverly. 
(The suite is empty) 
CRUSHER: Computer, current location of Doctor Dalen Quaice. 
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. 
(A little later, after the opening titles, the doorbell chimes) 
CRUSHER: Come. 
(Worf enters) 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before we left starbase, an old
friend of mine came onboard. Doctor Dalen Quaice. I requested quarters
for him. He was assigned here. 
WORF: I was not aware of this passenger. 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. I thought it was standard procedure for you to be
notified after Captain Picard approved passage. 
WORF: It is. Please proceed. 
CRUSHER: We were to meet for breakfast, but I can't seem to find him or
his belongings. 
WORF: Computer, where is Doctor Dalen Quaice? 
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice aboard the Enterprise. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very old and rather frail. If he
fell somewhere, if his communicator were damaged. 
WORF: I will order a search immediately. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. 
WORF: Even if Doctor Quaice had been injured, why would his belongings
be missing?

[Ready room]

WORF: Sir, I have several teams conducting a deck
by deck search. It is not yet complete. 
DATA: I have scanned the entire ship, Captain. Other than the
Enterprise's regular complement, I can find no one else onboard. 
CRUSHER: Your sensors wouldn't detect him if he were dead. 
DATA: That is correct, Doctor. 
PICARD: Could your friend have returned to the starbase without telling
you? An emergency of some sort? 
CRUSHER: There were a lot of people going back and forth between the
ship and the starbase yesterday. 
DATA: We can easily check the transporter ID traces. 
PICARD: By all means check the trace log. But even if the results are
negative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Data and Worf leave) 
PICARD: One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you are aware of the procedure
involving passengers. 
CRUSHER: Of course. I don't know why Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about
Doctor Quaice. 
PICARD: I was not informed either. 
CRUSHER: But I sent in a request weeks ago. 
PICARD: Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me. 
CRUSHER: And someone else sent the approval? Why? 
PICARD: Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time?

CRUSHER: Six years. 
PICARD: Perhaps it would be prudent to find out if he'd acquired any
enemies there.
