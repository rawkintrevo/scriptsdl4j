[Lounge]

VICTORIA: Look at your father, Wyatt. He just can't
wait to strip off his clothes for that barbaric ceremony. 
WYATT: Please take care of each other. (to Deanna) You are beautiful.
But you looked best of all in the desert on the holodeck when we did
this.

[Transporter room]

CHIEF: You can put the supplies on the pad. Doctor
Crusher had me set the coordinates. All we need is the captain's order.

(Wyatt injects the Chief and he goes down. Then Wyatt activates the
transporter and stands on the pad with the supplies)

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Captain! Someone's transporting over to
the Tarellian ship. 
PICARD: Override. 
LAFORGE: I can't sir. It's too late.

[Tarellian ship]

(Wyatt beams into a corridor lines with drawings of
himself at different ages) 
WRENN: Hello, Wyatt. We always thought you were a dream. 
WYATT: You're not surprised. Did you know I'd beam over? 
WRENN: Once we saw you were real, we knew. You are a doctor? 
WYATT: Yes. I've brought medicines and supplies. 
ARIANA: And I knew you would be this brave.

[Bridge]

VICTORIA: How could you let this happen? My son,
surrounded by those horrible lepers! 
PICARD: Mrs. Miller, if I could have prevented this I would have. 
VICTORIA: Beam him back. 
TROI: He can never come back, Mrs. Miller. 
WRENN [on viewscreen]: You may turn off your tractor beam, Captain. We
will not be going to Haven. We have what we really came for. 
VICTORIA: Wyatt? 
WYATT: Mother. Father. Forgive me, but I must. I'm going to try to
continue the work to cure these people. 
ARIANA: And Wyatt will do it. I've believed that all along. 
WYATT: I knew I was coming to Haven to meet my destiny. I thought it
was to be with you, Deanna. It was Ariana who drew me here. I'm sorry. 
TROI: Wyatt, I'm happy for you, and for Ariana too. 
LWAXANA: You've done very well for a human, Wyatt. 
TROI: Mother. 
WRENN [on viewscreen]: Captain, my respects. 
PICARD: And mine, sir. 
(Transmission ends) 
TROI: Goodbye.
