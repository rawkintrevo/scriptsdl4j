PIERCE CRUSHER CALLOWAY TROI WORF

[Engineering]

WORF: You were Lieutenant Kwan's supervisor at
Utopia Planitia? 
PIERCE: That's right. I was sorry to hear what happened. 
TROI: Did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it was
under construction? 
PIERCE: I worked all over the ship. In fact, I remember running a power
conduit right behind this wall here. 
TROI: Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as Lieutenant
Kwan? 
PIERCE: It was a long time ago. People were working all over the place.

WORF: So you do not remember? 
PIERCE: I'm sorry, I don't. 
TROI: Do you recall if anything unusual happened there? 
PIERCE: How do you mean? 
TROI: An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan. 
PIERCE: No, nothing like that. The way I remember it, things went
pretty smoothly. What's this all about, if you don't mind my asking? 
TROI: Not at all. When I was in the nacelle room I had an empathic
experience. 
WORF: We believe the Counsellor may have been seeing an event that
occurred eight years ago. 
TROI: And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why that might be? 
PIERCE: I'm afraid I don't. 
TROI: Lieutenant, are you aware that I can sense when someone's telling
the truth? 
PIERCE: I've heard that. 
TROI: Then I'm sure that if you remember anything that might be
relevant to our investigation, you'll contact me. 
PIERCE: Of course. 
TROI: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
PIERCE: Counsellor. 
[Corridor]

TROI: The strange thing is I couldn't read him at
all. 
WORF: But you implied that? We have played poker together many times.
I've never known you to bluff. 
TROI: Well it wouldn't be much of a bluff if you knew, would it? The
fact that I couldn't read him suggests that he has at least some
telepathic ability. 
WORF: But Pierce is human. 
TROI: That's what I don't understand. Even though I couldn't read his
emotions, I did feel that he was holding something back. 
WORF: I thought so as well. 
TROI: Maybe we should try to access the Engineering logs from Utopia
Planitia. We might find out more about him. 
WORF: There may be something in them about Lieutenant Kwan as well.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: It going to take about half an hour for the
transmission to be completed. 
WORF: Perhaps we should continue this in the morning. 
TROI: It is late. 
WORF: Yes, and you must be tired. 
TROI: A little. 
WORF: So I will say goodnight. 
TROI: Goodnight. 
WORF: We should get an early start tomorrow. 
TROI: I think we should. I'll see you in the morning. 
WORF: Yes. 
(finally, Worf takes her hand and nuzzles her neck, then they kiss
passionately) 
(next morning, Troi is still in bed and Worf is already dressed. He
kisses her awake. I thought non-Klingon females were too fragile??) 
TROI: Hello. 
WORF: Breakfast is ready. 
TROI: That sounds nice. But it can wait. Why didn't we do this a long
time ago? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Counsellor Troi. 
TROI: Yes, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]

 CRUSHER: I've synthesised the inhibitor. Please
come to Sickbay whenever you're ready. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Acknowledged. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher to Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Worf, here. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Medical supplies are ready to be taken to cargo bay for
transport. 
WORF: I will be there shortly. 
[Sickbay]

(Deanna gets her shot) 
CRUSHER: This should take effect immediately. 
TROI: Will it completely suppress my empathic abilities? 
CRUSHER: It's hard to say for sure, but I can always increase the
dosage if it's not enough. 
(Worf enters with Calloway) 
WORF: The cargo bay will be off limits to all but medical personnel. 
CALLOWAY: Thanks for your help, sir. 
WORF: You're welcome. 
TROI: Good morning. 
WORF: Counsellor. 
TROI: Data and Geordi are already in the nacelle tube. Are you ready? 
WORF: Yes. 
CALLOWAY: Excuse me, sir. About the quarantine field in the cargo bay?
It looks like we'll need a second field generator. 
WORF: I am needed here. I will join you as soon as I can. 
TROI: All right. 
WORF: Apparently my help was not so good after all. 
CALLOWAY: Yes, it was. You were wonderful. 
WORF: I think I know what's wrong.
