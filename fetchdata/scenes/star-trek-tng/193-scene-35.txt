[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: That's it. I've disconnected the visual
and audio pickups. We can talk without being monitored by the computer.

WORF: By Barclay. 
PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: It is now almost impossible to tell where Barclay ends and the
computer begins. He's actually rewriting the isolinear chips each time
he extends himself a little further. 
RIKER: How do we get him out of there? 
LAFORGE: We don't. Not without killing him. 
PICARD: This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him,
but I cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to act
as the computer. I don't care how smart he is. 
DATA: Lieutenant Barclay has not yet extended himself into the
Engineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an ODN bypass
directly to the Bridge. 
PICARD: That still won't give us control of the ship. 
LAFORGE: No, but it would give us access to the propulsion systems.
Enough to get us to the next Starbase. 
RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? 
LAFORGE: A few hours. 
PICARD: Make it so.

BARCLAY [OC]: Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Reg? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I thought you would be in your quarters. 
LAFORGE: No, I'm just catching up on some work, you know? That level
three diagnostic we talked about. How're you doing? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I wish I could convey to you what it's like for me now.
What I've become. 
LAFORGE: Yeah? Try. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can conceive almost infinite possibilities, and can
fully explore each of them in a nanosecond. I perceive the universe as
a single equation, and it is so simple, I understand. 
LAFORGE: You understand? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Everything. 
LAFORGE: Well, do you understand how this happened to you? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I believe it is a gift. That I have been chosen to
fulfill a great purpose. 
LAFORGE: Ah ha. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Do you suppose all of this has changed the way people
think about me? 
LAFORGE: To tell you the truth, Reg, we don't know what to think. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I've been concerned about that, but soon everyone will
understand what I can do for humanity. 
LAFORGE: What do you mean? 
[Holodeck]

BARCLAY [OC]: We have always perceived the maximum
speed of the Enterprise as a function of warp, but I know now there are
no limits. We will explore new worlds that we could never before have
reached in our lifetime. 
[Jefferies tube]

BARCLAY [OC]: I will take us to them.

WORF: Captain, I am picking up subspace distortion.

PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field
emanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in the
subspace continuum. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton field
disturbance? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, sir, I'm altering subspace in a way that's never
been conceived of before. I'm fairly certain it will allow us to travel
half-way across the galaxy in a matter of only 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, I want you to stop this experiment for now. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Captain, if you'd only allow me to show 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever it
is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I really would rather not, sir. I'm positive that you'll
be pleased with the result once I've finished showing 
WORF: Audio is disconnected. We may speak freely. 
RIKER: How soon before the ODN process is in place? 
DATA: I have been monitoring Geordi's progress. It will be operational
in seventeen minutes. 
TROI: Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. 
WORF: Sir, the subspace distortion continues to increase.
