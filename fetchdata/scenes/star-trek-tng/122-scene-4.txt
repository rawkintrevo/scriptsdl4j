TROI LAFORGE PICARD PRIETO LYNCH DATA

[Engineering]

LYNCH: Captain, I'm in the middle of realigning the
dilithium crystals. 
PICARD [OC]: There is an emergency. We need warp drive. How long? 
LYNCH: Twenty minutes. Maybe more. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We don't have it, Mister Lynch. 
LYNCH [OC]: I'll align it by hand.
PICARD: Whatever it takes. 
LYNCH [OC]: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: Shuttle, this is the Enterprise. Your coordinates now read two
three seven point one zero one. Ben, you're dangerously close to a
planet. 
PRIETO [OC]: I can see it. 
DATA: The planet is Vagra Two, sir, in the Zed Lapis sector.
Uninhabited. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, report! 
TROI [OC]: This is Counsellor Troi. I'll relay, sir. The pilot is busy.
We've lost most of our impulse power. 
PICARD: Engineering, status report. 
[Engineering]

LYNCH: Working on it, Captain. Three minutes. 
[Bridge]

LYNCH [OC]: But there are no guarantees. 
PRIETO [OC]: Captain, we're out of control. We're caught in the
planet's gravity. 
Captain's log, supplemental. We've lost all contact
with shuttlecraft thirteen, and can only assume they've crash-landed on
Vagra Two.
Meanwhile, main Engineering is trying to return us to warp power.
