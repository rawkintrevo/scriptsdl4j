[Ten Forward]

(Data has the cigar and the arm gestures off
pat)
DATA: A guy walks into the doctor's office The doctor tells him you
need an operation. The guy says I want a second opinion. The doctor
said, okay, you're ugly too. Ba-boom boom. Was that funny? 
GUINAN: No. 
(Data sits, disconsolate) 
GUINAN: Data, you spoiled the joke. It could have been your timing. 
DATA: My timing is digital. (Guinan giggles) What? 
GUINAN: That's funny. 
DATA: Why? 
GUINAN: It would take too long to explain. Tell me another joke. 
DATA: (with cigar and silly voice) A monk, a clone and a Ferengi decide
to go bowling together. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Data, report to the main Bridge immediately. 
DATA: I will be back. 
GUINAN: Bring new jokes.

[Bridge]

WORF: We have an unidentified at twelve mark four.
No response to our enquiries. 
PICARD: Extend hailing frequencies, all languages, all channels. 
WORF: Extending. 
DATA: Sensors show it to be an interplanetary vessel, sir. Class seven,
crew complement twenty six. 
WORF: Still no response. Captain, they are now locking lasers on us. 
RIKER: Lasers? 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Lasers can't even penetrate our navigation shields. Don't they
know that?
RIKER: Regulations so call for a Yellow Alert. 
PICARD: A very old regulation. Well, make it so, Number One. And reduce
speed. Drop main shields as well. 
RIKER: May I ask why, sir? 
PICARD: In case we decide to surrender to them, Number One. 
WORF: Still no response to our hail, sir. 
DATA: It is slowing and is holding its position, Captain. 
WORF: Sir, we are now being hailed. 
PICARD: Viewer on. 
(A middle aged man with a neat beard, dressed in simple grey, has his
arms folded
belligerently) 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Federation vessel, you have no rights in this
solar system. I am Debin of planet Atlec, ordering you to heave to and
prepare to be boarded. 
RIKER: Shades of Gulliver's Travels. He actually meant it. 
PICARD: But he is right. We are in their solar system. Open a channel. 
WORF: Open, sir. 
PICARD: I am Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise. For what
reason have you locked your weapons on us? 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Enterprise, you are towing a spacecraft of a
known criminal. 
PICARD: He was in need of emergency repair. It was our obligation to
assist. 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: You have a man aboard by the name of Okona. I
want him. 
PICARD: On what authority? 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: He is guilty of crimes committed on the planet
Atlec. I expect him to be turned over to my authority immediately. 
WORF: Mute. 
PICARD: What do you think, Counsellor? 
TROI: He believes what he's saying. His anger is genuine. 
PICARD: Open. What crimes are you referring to? 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Neither important nor necessary. I want Okona
now! 
WESLEY: Captain, we have another Class seven armed spacecraft
approaching, from the opposite sector. 
RIKER: Another ship from Atlec? 
DATA: Similar in specifications and capabilities, but a variation in
markings and hailing language. 
PICARD: Debin, hold this position. Viewer off. Data, identify. 
DATA: Sensors indicate it a security vessel from the planet Straleb. 
WORF: Another glob fly. 
RIKER: Glob fly? 
DATA: A Klingon fly, half the size of an Earth mosquito, with no sting
and a buzzing sound like this. 
PICARD: Data. Viewer on. Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Open, sir 
(A clean-shaven man in brown, with a younger man in a leather jacket
just behind him) 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: I am Secretary Kushell from the Legation of
Unity of the planet Straleb. 
PICARD: I am Captain Picard. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: We know who you are, Captain Picard. We have
been monitoring your communications, and we know of the demands made by
Debin of planet Atlec. 
PICARD: Then you're aware that we have no hostile interaction. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: You only have to concede to one demand. 
PICARD: That word demand has a tone of finality. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: It is a word I have chosen. We demand you turn
Okona over to us immediately. 
WORF: Mute. 
PICARD: Mister Okona to the Bridge immediately. Open. The same demand
has been made by the Atlec legation. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: I have no interest in their request, but we
intend to back up our legal right to Okona. 
PICARD: I would rather not escalate this situation any further. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: Our honour and prestige are at stake. We are
prepared to take Okona by force and die in the doing of it if
necessary. 
PICARD: I trust that that can be avoided. I will respond to your
request shortly. Viewer off. 
WORF: Captain Okona has not responded, sir. He's been reported in three
different crew quarters. 
PICARD: Find him. Get him up here. 
WORF: Yes, sir.
