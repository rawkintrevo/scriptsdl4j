[Shuttlecraft]

WORF: Onboard systems do not appear to be disrupted
by the field, but I can barely read you, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: Acknowledged. Maintain 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Communications as long as conditions permit.

DATA: Commander. I am reading a power surge in the Tamarian plasma
reactor. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf! Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta! 
[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER [OC]: Manoeuvre sequence delta.

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, the shuttle has been hit. 
RIKER: Damage? 
DATA: The starboard nacelle has been rendered inoperable. 
RIKER: That's all? Riker to Worf.

[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER [OC]: Report. 
WORF: Starboard thrusters destroyed. I may be able to land but I will
not be able to take off.
RIKER [OC]: Understood. Return to the Enterprise, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Enough to turn them back, but not enough to
hurt them. 
DATA: Yes, sir. The phaser pulse appears to have been carefully
attenuated for just that effect. 
RIKER: Nice shooting.

[Observation lounge]

(Atmospheric ionisation scan 927 is on the wall
monitor) 
LAFORGE: I'm pretty sure I can punch up the annular confinement beam
enough to transport the captain through the field, but it's going to
take me at least a full day to do it. 
TROI: Captain Picard could be dead by then. 
WORF: I do not believe so. I have confidence in his ability as a
warrior. He will be victorious. 
TROI: You're still assuming this is some sort of a challenge ritual. We
can't be certain of that. 
RIKER: Agreed. We're only making educated guesses about their
motivations, no more than that. 
WORF: Then why do we wait? If we attack the ship now, they will not be
able to maintain their scattering field. 
RIKER: Which might start a shooting match, and for all we know, a war,
and we still might not be able to save the captain. 
WORF: It would end this stalemate. 
RIKER: It's too much of a risk. I'll take that course when it's the
last one left. Who the hell are these people?
There's got to be some way to get through to them. 
DATA: As I have said, with further study it may be possible 
RIKER: Then do it. Deanna, help him. I want something by oh nine
hundred hours.
