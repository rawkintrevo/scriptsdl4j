[Planet surface]

(night has fallen, a fire is lit and Dathon is
lying down) 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. 
PICARD: Our situation is similar to theirs. I understand that. But I
need to know more. You must tell me more about Darmok and Jalad. Tell
me. You used the words, 'Temba, his arms wide' when you gave me the
knife and the fire. Could that mean give? Temba, his arms wide. Darmok.
Give me more about Darmok. 
DATHON: Darmok on the ocean. 
PICARD: Darmok. (draws on the soil) The ocean. Darmok on the ocean. A
metaphor? For being alone? Isolated? Darmok on the ocean. 
(Dathon writhes in pain) 
PICARD: Are you alright? 
DATHON: Kiazi's children, their faces wet. 
PICARD: Temba, his arms open. Give me more about Darmok on the ocean. 
DATHON: Tanagra on the ocean. Darmok at Tanagra. 
PICARD: At Tanagra. A country? Tanagra on the ocean. An island. Temba,
his arms wide. 
DATHON: Jalad on the ocean. Jalad at Tanagra. 
PICARD: Jalad at Tanagra. He went to the same island as Darmok. Darmok
and Jalad Tanagra. 
DATHON: The beast at Tanagra. 
PICARD: The beast? There was a creature at Tanagra? Darmok and Jalad,
the beast of Tanagra. They arrived separately. They struggled together
against a common foe, the beast at Tanagra. Darmok and Jalad at
Tanagra. 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. 
PICARD: They left together. Darmok and Jalad on the ocean. 
DATHON: The ocean. (another spasm) Zinda! His face black, his eyes red.
Callimas at Bahar. 
PICARD: You hoped this would happen, didn't you? You knew there was a
dangerous creature on this planet and you knew from the tale of Darmok
that a danger shared might sometimes bring two people together. Darmok
and Jalad at Tanagra. You and me, here, at El-Adrel. 
DATHON: Kira at Bashi. Temba, his arms wide. 
PICARD: My turn? No, I'm not much of a story teller. Besides, you
wouldn't understand. Shaka. when the walls fell. Perhaps that doesn't
matter. You want to hear it anyway. There's a story, a very ancient
one, from Earth. I'll try and remember it. Gilgamesh, a king.
Gilgamesh, a king, at Uruk. He tormented his subjects. He made them
angry. They cried out aloud, send us a companion for our king. Spare us
from his madness. Enkidu, a wild man from the forest, entered the city.
They fought in the temple. They fought in the street. Gilgamesh
defeated Enkidu. They became great friends. Gilgamesh and Enkidu at
Uruk. 
DATHON: At Uruk. 
PICARD: The new friends went out into the desert together, where the
great bull of heaven was killing men by the hundreds. Enkidu caught the
bull by the tail. Gilgamesh struck it with his sword. 
DATHON: Gilgamesh. 
PICARD: They were victorious. But Enkidu fell to the ground, struck
down by the gods. And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears, saying, 'he who was
my companion through adventure and hardship, is gone forever. 
(and so Dathon dies)

First Officer's log, supplemental. Despite the risk
of war, I have no choice but to break the stalemate.
