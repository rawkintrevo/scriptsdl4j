PICARD COMPUTER JESSICA LEECH

[Hill's office]

JESSICA: I'm not sure who wants me dead. My
husband, my stepdaughter. 
PICARD: Or a lover, perhaps? 
JESSICA: Perhaps. Or perhaps it's Cyrus Redblock. I need you to find
out. Name your fee. 
PICARD: Twenty dollars a day, plus expenses. 
JESSICA: Agreed. 
PICARD: I haven't said yes yet. 
JESSICA: Oh, you'll say yes, Mister Hill. (she kisses him) If it is
Redblock, he must think I've got what he's looking for. But believe me,
I don't. 
PICARD: I'll take your word for it. 
JESSICA: Here's a C-note in advance. Consider it a retainer. (she tucks
it in his collar) And next time, wear a suit. Au revoir. 
(She takes one of his calling cards and leaves. Picard looks out of the
window) 
PICARD: Remarkable. Exit. 
(He is just leaving the holodeck when there is a knock on the office
door)
PICARD: You'll have to call again. I'm just leaving. I'm not dressed
properly. I'll be back. 
(Picard leaves, the exit vanishes and the visitor enters the
room)
LEECH: (Peter Lorre accent) Mister Hill? Where are you? 
[Outside Holodeck]

PICARD: Memory, save current setting. 
COMPUTER: Current setting saved. 
PICARD: Holodeck off. 
(The crew notice the red lipstick on his face as he goes along the
corridor)
