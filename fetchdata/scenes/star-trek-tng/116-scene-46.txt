(Picard and Riker beam in but there is no
resistance. The four Bynars are lying propped up against each other,
and do not seem well) 
RIKER: Over here, Captain. 
PICARD: Why did you steal my ship? 
ONE ZERO: Please try to 
ZERO ONE: help us. 
(They pass out again. The Enterprise enters planetary orbit as the
countdown passes two minutes) 
PICARD: Cancel auto-destruct. 
COMPUTER: (male) Does the First Officer agree? 
RIKER: Affirmative. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct cancelled. 
RIKER: We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? 
PICARD: They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers from
Bynaus. 
RIKER: Their main computer is off. All sensors reveal that all of the
equipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send any
messages. 
PICARD: What about all the people in that world who are totally
dependant on their computer? Are they still functioning? 
RIKER: They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. What is this all
about? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What is their
purpose? 
PICARD: They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space.
Let's see what they've stored. 
RIKER: Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computer
has been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world to
our computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. 
PICARD: Maybe they did. 
RIKER: Minuet. 
PICARD: Maybe.

(Minuet comes back to 'life' when they arrive at
the table) 
RIKER: Tell me what this is all about. 
MINUET: A star in the Bynar system went supernova and they
miscalculated. The electromagnetic pulse from the explosion was going
to knock out their main computer. 
PICARD: So their only choice was to transfer all the stored information
and shut down until after it passed. And then reactivate their system
and transfer the information back to this main computer. 
RIKER: The Enterprise has the only mobile computer large enough to
handle all that information. 
PICARD: So what went wrong? Why are they dying? 
MINUET: The star went supernova before it was expected, and you were
late arriving at Starbase 74. 
PICARD: Why didn't they say something? Why didn't they just ask for
help? 
MINUET: I don't know. I don't have those answers. 
PICARD: Is there anything we can do? 
MINUET: Yes. Return the data stored on the Enterprise's computer back
to the one on Bynaus. 
RIKER: How can we do that? 
MINUET: You don't know? 
RIKER: Yes. If we had the file name. But we don't. Do you? 
MINUET: I don't know what you're talking about. 
PICARD: They wouldn't intentionally hide it or make it difficult for us
to find. It must be right in front of our faces. 
RIKER: We should call Starbase 74, and see if anyone can decipher this.

MINUET: They're dying. They meant you no harm. It was their world they
were trying to save. Help them, Will. Hurry. Please.

PICARD: Starbase 74, this is the Enterprise. Do you
read me? 
[Starbase Command Centre]

QUINTEROS: This is Starbase 74. Captain Picard,
what is your situation? 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We'll go into that later. Right now I must
speak to Lieutenant Commander Data. 
DATA [OC]: I am here, sir. 
PICARD: Data, the Bynars have stored an enormous amount of material in
our computer. We need to access it. We can't. 
[Starbase Command Centre]

DATA: The access would be available by code or
password. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Yes, I know that, Data, but what could it
be?
