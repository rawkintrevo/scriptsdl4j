PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker, report to the Bridge.

RIKER: On the way. 
BERNARD: Harry! Harry, come back here! 
(The running child bumps straight into Riker)
RIKER: What's your hurry, Harry? 
HARRY: Sorry, Commander. I was just 
(His father arrives) 
BERNARD: Harry! I'm sorry if he bothered you. 
RIKER: No bother, Doctor Bernard. 
HARRY: I'm not going back. I hate that teacher and I hate calculus. 
BERNARD: Everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus, whether
they like it or not. 
HARRY: Why?

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: You're limping. 
RIKER: Had a small run-in with an aspiring sprinter. 
PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: Problem, Captain? 
PICARD: No, more a curiosity. For the past few hours we've been
tracking faint energy readings in an attempt to locate the source. It's
like following a trail of bread crumbs. The pathfinder lead here and
stopped, which is what I knew would interest you. 
RIKER: What's our position, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: The Epsilon Mynos system, sir. 
RIKER: Thank you, Captain, you're right. I wouldn't miss this for
anything. 
TASHA: What's so interesting about this system? 
RIKER: Aldea. Tasha, I'm surprised you haven't heard the stories about
Aldea, the
wondrous mythical world. Like Atlantis of ancient Earth or Neinman of
Xerxes Seven. Advanced culture, centuries old. Self-contained,
peaceful. Incredible technical sophistication providing the daily needs
for all the citizens, so that they could turn themselves over to art
and culture. 
TASHA: Where is it supposed to be? 
RIKER: That's the myth. Somehow, as the legend goes, the Aldeans were
able to cloak their planet in darkness and go unseen by marauders, and
other hostile passers-by who might rob and plunder. 
TASHA: What a wonderful fairy tale. 
DATA: Scanners still show nothing, sir. 
TROI: Scanners may show nothing, sir, but I'm sensing something very
strong. Thousands of minds. 
PICARD: From where? 
TROI: Very close. 
PICARD: All stop, and hold this position. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. All stop, and hold. 
PICARD: Anything? 
WORF: Captain, I'm recording a distortion in quadrant one, mark nine
zero. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(The stars wobble) 
PICARD: Shields and deflectors up. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
(Then a golden planet comes into view) 
RIKER: It's Aldea, Captain. It has to be.

Captain's log, stardate 41509.1. Either by chance
or intent, we've been led to the planet Aldea, which appeared out of
nowhere, hidden behind a sophisticated shielding device.
