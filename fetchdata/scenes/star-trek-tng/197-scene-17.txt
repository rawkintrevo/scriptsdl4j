PICARD: Engage tractor beam. Report, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: We've lost port thrusters 
[Shuttlecraft]

RIKER: And both backup stabilisers. I'm losing
control. 
PICARD [OC]: We're bringing you in. 
(the tractor beam grabs them and the other ship veers off) 
RIKER: Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up.
You can't tow us. You'd better beam us directly on board. 
ODAN: No, don't do it. 
RIKER: I can't stabilise the shuttle. 
ODAN: If you transport me, it will kill me. Please. 
PICARD [OC]: Number One we're ready to beam you aboard. 
RIKER: Belay that order, Captain. I'll bring her in manually. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Advise Doctor Crusher we have a medical
emergency.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He's in shock, he's lost a lot of blood,
but that still doesn't explain these readings. Eosinophilia in the
cerebrospinal fluid at forty six percent. 
OGAWA: Sedimentation rate is twenty nine, but his lymphocytes are still
intact. 
CRUSHER: It's as though there's a parasite at work. Odan, Odan. I need
to do exploratory surgery. You may have a parasitic infection. 
ODAN: You must not. 
CRUSHER: But you won't survive. 
(then she notices the movement in his abdomen) 
CRUSHER: What is that? 
ODAN: Beverly, that is me. 
CRUSHER: What? 
ODAN: This body is just a host. I am that parasite. That is what must
survive. It has always been this way. The Trill are a joined species. A
host and a symbiont, and in this fashion we have survived for
millennia. 
CRUSHER: You're dying. What can I do? 
ODAN: The host body is dying. You must contact the Trill quickly. Tell
them I need another host. They will send a replacement. I know this is
difficult to accept, but I beg you, Doctor Beverly, help me. This
mission must be completed.

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: Odan's host body died of the injuries just
over an hour ago. But the symbiont being, Odan, is still alive. Odan is
the one who negotiated the last treaty, but the man everyone thought
was his father was just another host body. 
RIKER: And the reason Odan refused the transporter? 
CRUSHER: It would have damaged the symbiont. 
PICARD: We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in forty
hours. 
CRUSHER: I've placed Odan in stasis. He can survive another hour, maybe
two, but not beyond that. 
DATA: Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? 
CRUSHER: No, Data. The relationship requires a biological being. 
PICARD: We are at a desperate impasse in the Peliar system. The attack
on the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute. 
TROI: Who was responsible? 
PICARD: No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and the
threats are mounting. We need Odan. 
RIKER: Doctor, could a human host carry him? 
CRUSHER: I believe so. From Odan's description of the process it should
be possible. But I don't have 
RIKER: Then I volunteer. 
CRUSHER: There's been no precedent for a human host. I couldn't
guarantee what might happen. 
PICARD: The risk is too great, Commander. 
RIKER: Weigh it against the prospect of war. 
PICARD: It's your choice, Will. 
RIKER: Let's get to it.
