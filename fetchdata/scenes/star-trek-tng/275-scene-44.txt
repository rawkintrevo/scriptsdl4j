PICARD RIKER WORF LAFORGE CONDUCTOR

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Keep it steady. Put your back into it.
That's the ticket. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: The ship is using a modified tractor beam to
collect vertion particles from the star. 
PICARD: Vertion particles. Vertiform City. That's what the ship was
looking for. 
(shudder) 
RIKER: The particles are being routed through the transporter system
into cargo bay five. 
PICARD: Geordi, what's going on? 
LAFORGE [OC]: The object is absorbing

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Vertion particles. It's growing even
faster than before. Commander, I'm picking up internal energy this
thing. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: What do you mean? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I mean it's generating its own energy. I'm picking up
coherent emissions 
[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: Matter conversion. It's incredible. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute, something's wrong. We've got power fluctuations.
Vertion absorption rate is dropping. What's happening to the particle
beam? 
[Bridge]

RIKER: The beam's exhausted the supply of particles
in the star. There's nothing left to take out. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain 
[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: The energy output of the object is
decreasing. 
[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Something's wrong. 
WORF: What is it? 
CONDUCTOR: This was supposed to be Vertiform City. (the beam disengages
and the object stops glowing) 
CONDUCTOR: We've been on the wrong track all along. 
(the Conductor pulls the brake lever and everyone gets thrown around)
