TROI: I'm sure the health and safety inspection
won't last much longer. And in the meantime, I'm really glad that we
have this opportunity to get to know you. May I ask what business
you're in? 
(silent stare) 
DATA: Lieutenant Worf has programmed our replicators to make a very
good approximation of Klingon bloodwine. I believe you will find it to
your liking.

CRUSHER: Well, that's my third scan and I still
haven't find anything out of the ordinary. 
WORF: He must be hiding something. We should download his computer
memory and analyse it. 
CRUSHER: I'd have a hard time defending that as part of a safety
inspection. 
WORF: We could claim that the computer was generating abnormal
radiation signatures. 
CRUSHER: Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground as it is. We can't just 
(the raiding party beams in. Riker stuns an incoming crewman) 
PICARD: Don't! 
RIKER: Watch that door. 
WORF: What is going on? 
NARIK: Shut your mouth, Klingon. 
RIKER: I guess you're surprised to see me, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: You could say that. 
RIKER: I've had a change of profession. 
PICARD: It's not in here. Hey, you, where's the artefact? 
WORF: I do not know what you're talking about. 
RIKER: Use your brain. They wouldn't be searching the shuttle if they
had the artefact. Koral must have it. Where is that Klingon pilot? 
CRUSHER: In the Observation lounge with Data and Troi. 
NARIK: How far? 
RIKER: Twelve decks away. 
WORF: Security will not allow you to get that far. 
RIKER: They won't get the chance. We'll use the transporter in that
shuttle. We'll beam directly to the Observation lounge. Sorry about
this. 
(Riker shoots Worf and Crusher) 
RIKER: Let's go.
