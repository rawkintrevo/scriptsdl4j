CRUSHER: Wesley? 
(She hands him his case, and hugs him) 
CRUSHER: Take care. 
WESLEY: You too, Mom. 
CRUSHER: Something the matter? 
WESLEY: We've been scanning Ferengi transmissions, trying to find the
Krayton. One of the signals was, I don't know, familiar somehow. 
CRUSHER: Something in the message? 
WESLEY: No, the message was scrambled. It was the static! 
CRUSHER: Where are you going?

WORF: Captain. The Bradbury has informed us they
can wait no longer for Mister Crusher to come aboard. 
(Wesley dashes in)
PICARD: Wesley.
WESLEY: Captain, I think there's a pattern to the subspace interference
I heard on one of the Ferengi messages. 
PICARD: Wesley, unless you leave immediately, you're going to miss the
Bradbury. 
WESLEY: The interference itself could be a message. If I could just
hear a replay of the subspace scans. 
PICARD: Signal the Bradbury they may leave. Play back the Ferengi
transmissions. 
WESLEY: Wait. Repeat that one. Put it on a continuous replay. Hear that
popping noise? Data, can you filter out everything but that sound? 
LAFORGE: That's Cochrane distortion. A fluctuation in the phase of the
subspace field. All warp engines generate that kind of interference. 
WESLEY: But listen to the pattern. It's the Algolian ceremonial rhythm
that the musician played at the reception. 
DATA: Mister Crusher is correct, sir. There is a temporal correlation. 
PICARD: Then it is a signal from Commander Riker. Ingenious. He
selected a signal we'd recognise but one the Ferengi would dismiss as
static. 
WORF: Signal source located, Captain. 
PICARD: Plot an intercept course. 
WESLEY: Course plotted and laid in, sir. 
PICARD: Well done, Mister Crusher. Warp eight. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage.

[Ferengi lab]

(Lwaxana is not suffering in silence. Riker and
Troi burst in. Riker shoots at Farek) 
RIKER: Get away from her. 
FAREK: What are you doing? br
(Troi runs to her mother and Tog sneaks up from behind) 
TOG: Stand off, Commander. 
(Riker hands over the weapon) 
LWAXANA: DaiMon Tog, can't we strike a bargain? All I'm concerned about
is my daughter's safety. What happens to me isn't important. 
TOG: What are you suggesting? 
LWAXANA: Let me be candid, DaiMon Tog. Deanna's of no use to you. She's
only half Betazoid. And if you keep Riker, Starfleet will never stop
chasing for you. Release them. Release them and I will stay with you
willingly. I'll even use my telepathy to aid you in your negotiations. 
TOG: A tempting offer. I would like to believe you. 
LWAXANA: The offer is genuine. I give you my word as a Daughter of the
Fifth House of Betazed. 
RIKER: Lwaxana, don't. 
LWAXANA: I've made up my mind. 
RIKER: I can't let you do this. 
LWAXANA: William, I am a grown woman. I can make my own decisions. 
TROI: Mother, we can't just leave you here. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: Yes, you can, and before he changes his mind. 
LWAXANA: Please, Little One, do this for me. Just this once. Do we have
an agreement? 
TOG: I give you my word. I will release your daughter and the
Commander. 
FERENGI [OC]: DaiMon. A Federation ship approaching at high warp. 
FAREK: The Enterprise has found us 
TOG: Slow to impulse. Raise shields. Inform the Enterprise that two of
our guests are ready to return. The other will be
staying with us, at her own request. 
FAREK: I must protest, DaiMon. 
TOG: Lwaxana has given her word. 
LWAXANA: Oo-mox is only the beginning.
