PICARD: You'll have to make course changes manually
until we re-establish the connection. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Understood. Mister Data, get us back online.
Geordi, try boosting the power to the LU bands. McKnight, increase the
distance between the Enterprise and the shuttle. We're going to need
some more room to make manual adjustments. 
[Shuttle]

PICARD: New heading two nine nine mark one eight. 
MCKNIGHT [OC]: Yes, sir, I've got it. Course corrected. 
PICARD: Enterprise, hard starboard! 
MCKNIGHT [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Deformation impact on deck fifteen, science
section. 
RIKER: Damage? 
WORF: Reports coming in. Minimal damage. 
[Shuttle]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, I am still having
difficulty controlling the shuttlecraft. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Your krellide storage cells are losing
their charge. Maintaining manual control is going to become
increasingly difficult.

[Shuttle]

PICARD: Estimated distance to the nebula's
perimeter? 
DATA [OC]: Four point seven million kilometres, sir. 
PICARD: Is there a way to transfer the microfusion thrusters so I can
get a power boost? 
DATA [OC]: Possibly. If you augment the thruster sequencing so that the
inertial dampening fields 
PICARD: Bearing two seven, make that two eight five, mark two five
five!

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, the shuttle is out of control. 
RIKER: Mister O'Brien do you have the Captain's signal? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: I'm having trouble locking on, sir.
DATA: Sir, the shuttle's inertial dampeners have failed. It is breaking
up. 
RIKER: Let's get him out of there.
