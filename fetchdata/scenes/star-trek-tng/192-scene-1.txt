BREVELLE [OC]: Tarchannen Three Investigation. Stardate 40164.7. Ensign
Anthony Brevelle recording. Lieutenant Susanna Leijten in command. 
SUSANNA: You up and running, Brevelle? 
BREVELLE [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: I've checked buildings four and five. Just like all the
others. No phaser hits, no sign of a fight. It's like the entire
outpost just vanished. 
HICKMAN: Lieutenant Leijten, you'd better come see this. No footprints,
no vehicle tracks. The wind probably erased them. But look. 
(he holds up a uniform) 
SUSANNA [OC]: Freeze visual.

SUSANNA: That's Hickman on the right, Mendez on the left, and as
already noted, the recording was made by Ensign Brevelle five years
ago. 
PICARD: Commander Leijten, you said that before Brevelle deserted
Starbase one one two last week, he'd been ill for several days. What
about Mendez? 
SUSANNA: Mendez was seen on the Aries an hour before she disappeared.
According to witnesses, she seemed completely normal. 
RIKER: And Hickman? 
SUSANNA: He just passed a routine physical on Alia Four with flying
colours. 
LAFORGE: No, wait, I know Paul Hickman. He's a family man, he's got two
kids. He wouldn't steal a shuttle and desert. 
SUSANNA: Geordi, he was spotted by a Federation supply ship yesterday,
on course to Tarchannen three. 
PICARD: The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, were
they? 
SUSANNA: No, we never learned what happened or why. Forty nine people
gone. 
RIKER: And five years later, the away team that was investigating their
disappearances have started to disappear themselves. 
SUSANNA: Geordi and I are the only two left.

Captain's log, stardate 44664.5. We've set a course
to intercept Lieutenant Hickman's stolen shuttlecraft, and, hopefully,
to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers.
