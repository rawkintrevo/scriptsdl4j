PICARD: Meribor? 
MERIBOR: (a fine young woman) Happy day, father. 
PICARD: Hey, that's my hobby. Find your own. 
MERIBOR: You're the one who taught me. Don't complain if you've turned
me into a scientist. 
PICARD: And what has the scientist been up to today? 
MERIBOR: Analysing soil samples. There isn't any anaerobic bacteria.
The soil is dead. This isn't just a very long drought, is it, Father? I
have entries in my log that go back ten years. You have data preceding
that for fifteen years. You've reached the same conclusion, I know you
have. 
PICARD: I haven't reached any conclusion. A good scientist doesn't
function by conjecture. 
MERIBOR: A good scientist functions by hypothesising and then proving
or disproving that hypothesis. That's what I did. 
PICARD: Hey, why don't you spend more time with that young fellow
Dannick? 
MERIBOR: You are changing the subject. 
PICARD: No, I'm not. I'm just hypothesising that he's in love with you.

MERIBOR: You've taught me to pursue the truth, no matter how painful it
is. It's too late to back off now. This planet is dying. 
PICARD: Perhaps I should have filled your head with trivial concerns.
Games and toys and clothes. 
MERIBOR: I don't think you mean that. 
PICARD: No, I don't. It just saddens me to see you burdened with the
knowledge things you can't change. 
MERIBOR: Father, I think I should marry Dannick sooner rather than
later, don't you? 
PICARD: Seize the time, Meribor. Live now. Make now always the most
precious time. Now will never come again. 
MERIBOR: I love you, Father.

CRUSHER: His vital signs are holding. They've been
stable ever since the beam was restored. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker, we've started to receive telemetry from the
probe we launched. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
LAFORGE: We've charted the alien probe's radiation trail for over one
light year. 
RIKER: Any way to extrapolate am origin? 
LAFORGE: Looks like a star system in the Silarian sector. Kataan. 
RIKER: Never heard of it. Data? 
DATA: It is an unmapped system of six planets, sir. 
RIKER: Any of them inhabited? 
DATA: Not any longer, sir. The star went nova. All life in the system
was destroyed approximately one thousand years ago.

(more years have past. Eline is old and grey,
whilst Picard is still peering into his refractor telescope) 
ELINE: I put away your shoes for you again. 
PICARD: Yes, thank you, dear. 
ELINE: You know, I've been looking through this thing off and on for
over thirty years, and I still don't see what you and Meribor find so
fascinating. 
PICARD: Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you're
supposed to. 
ELINE: You treat me like some frail flower. People have surgery all the
time. 
(flute music starts up) 
ELINE: He loves playing. He's quite good at it, don't you think? 
PICARD: He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all he
wanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. I
wish he could find some focus in his life. 
ELINE: I think he has. Maybe you should talk to him. 
PICARD: Batai? 
BATAI JR: Father? 
PICARD: I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to
tell me. 
BATAI JR: Yes. I was waiting for the right moment, but that will never
come. I'm leaving school. 
PICARD: Leaving school? No, you're not. 
BATAI JR: I want to concentrate on my music. That's what I care about. 
PICARD: Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year before
that, botany. Now 
BATAI JR: Through it all, there was my music. I think you know that,
Father. This is the life I want. 
PICARD: Well, we'll discuss it. 
BATAI JR: Thank you, father. 
(Batai goes back indoors) 
ELINE: Even after all these years you still have the ability to
surprise me. 
PICARD: If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way?
Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream. 
ELINE: Are you still planning to talk to the Administrator tomorrow? 
PICARD: There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. 
ELINE: Unless, of course, you keep quiet. 
PICARD: No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. 
ELINE: What a surprise.
