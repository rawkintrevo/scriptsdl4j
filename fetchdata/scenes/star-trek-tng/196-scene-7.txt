TIMICIN LWAXANA TROI

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: You know, one thing I don't understand. If
your people have known for generations that their sun is dying, why not
simply evacuate the planet? 
TIMICIN: It is our home. It defines who we are as a people. If Kaelon
Two ceases to exist, so do we. 
LWAXANA: Then you definitely should fix it.

LWAXANA [OC]: I am a woman dressing for a man. Something you might try
now and then, dear. I wonder if Timicin likes green. 
TROI: That's not very telepathic of you. 
LWAXANA: Oh, I tried telepathy on him. He's the wrong species. Right
species for everything else, though. You might try that once in a
while, too. 
TROI: You know, you're not just incorrigible, you're insatiable.
