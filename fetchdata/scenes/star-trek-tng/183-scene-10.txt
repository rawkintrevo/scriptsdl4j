[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, the miners report that they have
very few operable shuttlecraft. They want to know when we will be
joining the search. 
RIKER: Tell them to stand by. If this works, we'll be on our way. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: Thrusters are attached and ready, Commander. 
RIKER: Initiate prefire sequence. 
LAFORGE: Prefire command transmitted. Thrusters to standby. 
RIKER: Fire thrusters. Gradual acceleration to forty percent power. 
(The scow begins to move, but one thruster flies off on its own) 
LAFORGE: We've lost one module. Correcting thrust vectors to
compensate. 
DATA: Structural integrity of the barge has been compromised.
Disintegration is continuing. 
RIKER: Shut down thrusters. Ensign, take us to one thousand metres
ahead of the barge and hold. 
DATA: External radiation levels increasing, sir. 
ALLENBY: Coming into position at one thousand metres. 
RIKER: Worf, extend shields around the ship. Lock on the tractor beam. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Radiation levels at seventy millirads per minute and
rising. 
RIKER: Allenby, set a new course. We'll take it through the asteroid
belt ourselves. One quarter impulse. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. 
CRUSHER [OC]: On my way. 
RIKER: Mister Data, I'll a projection of the radiation's impact on the
crew. Mister Worf, contact the mining settlement. Tell them we won't be
joining the search for awhile.

[Cavern]

(they emerge from tunnels into a lit cavern with a
fountain in the middle) 
DIRGO: I knew there had to be water. 
(but he is stopped by a forcefield) 
PICARD: Mister Crusher what was that? 
WESLEY: It seems to be some kind of tightly confined annular force
field, sir. 
PICARD: Put there to protect the water. 
WESLEY: Yes. There has to be a way to deactivate it, sir. 
DIRGO: We can, with our phasers. 
PICARD: Mister Dirgo, I think it would be wiser 
(Dirgo fires at the forcefield) 
WESLEY: Captain, the EM reading. The power level's really spiking now. 
DIRGO: I think it's working. 
PICARD: Dirgo! 
(some things rush into the cavern, rather like the seraphim from
Raiders of the Lost Ark) 
PICARD: Stop firing! 
(one of the things takes the weapon from Dirgo. Rocks are coming loose)

PICARD: Wesley! 
(Picard pushes Wesley aside then gets buried under falling rocks
himself)
