WESLEY CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE ROBIN

[Engineering]

WESLEY: I'll modify the planetary scanners. 
LAFORGE: Just make sure we keep enough data lines open for stellar
physics. 
WESLEY: No problem. I'll compress the signal flow. 
LAFORGE: All right. 
(Geordi leaves him to it) 
WESLEY: Why aren't these registering? 
ROBIN: You might try calibrating them manually. 
WESLEY: Excuse me? 
ROBIN: The detectors. They tend to get temperamental. You can try
calibrating them by hand. 
WESLEY: You're kidding. The computer has to do this. 
ROBIN: No. Look. The subroutine lets you do it from the panel. Law
Seventeen. When all else fails, do it yourself. 
WESLEY: It's working. Thanks. 
ROBIN: Sure. 
WESLEY: By the way, I'm Wesley. Wesley Crusher. 
ROBIN: I know. Just came back from the Academy. 
WESLEY: That's right. 
ROBIN: Robin Lefler. 
WESLEY: Hi. 
ROBIN: Hi. 
ROBIN: Your neutrinos are drifting. 
(he finally lets go of her hand) 
WESLEY: They're what?

DATA: Geordi, a conflict has started between the
planetary evolution team and the stellar physicists. Each wishes to be
the first to use the thermal imaging array. 
LAFORGE: Well, tell them to flip a coin. We've got to work together on
this mission, otherwise we're never going to get it done. 
DATA: A coin. Very good. I will replicate one immediately. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Doctor Crusher to Data. 
DATA: Data here. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Do you have a minute to join me in Sickbay? I need your
help with something. 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. On my way.
