DIVOK KOROTH WORF

[Lava cave]

(on Boreth, in a cave, Worf and a bunch of Klingons
are staring into a fire, chanting) 
DIVOK: Kahless! I see Kahless! He is standing before me with a sword.
He wants something. Me. He wants me! He wants me to go with him! 
KOROTH: It is a powerful vision you have had, Divok. Kahless wants you
to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You are only nineteen and yet your place
among the honoured dead is already secure. Take him back to his
chamber. Let him sleep.

[Worf's chamber]

KOROTH: You're leaving us? 
WORF: It has been ten days, Koroth. I have had no visions. I have
received no insight. There is nothing here for me. 
KOROTH: What is the Story of the Promise, Worf? 
WORF: When Kahless had united our people and gave them the laws of
honour, he saw that his work was done. So one night he gathered his
belongings and departed for the edge of the city to say goodbye. 
KOROTH: The people wept. They did not want him to go. 
WORF: Then Kahless said, 'You are Klingons. You need no one but
yourselves. I will go now to Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day I will
return.' Then Kahless pointed to a star in the sky and said, 'Look for
me there, on that point of light.' 
KOROTH: So here we are, on a world circling that distant point of
light. It has been fifteen centuries since he made that promise, and
still we wait. What are ten days in the life of one Klingon compared to
that? Is the son of Mogh really so easily discouraged? You came to us
seeking answers but this is a place of questions. Open your heart to
Kahless. Ask him your questions. Let him speak to you with your mind
unclouded by doubt or hesitation. Only then can you find what you are
looking for. If you cannot do that, then perhaps you should return to
your starship.
