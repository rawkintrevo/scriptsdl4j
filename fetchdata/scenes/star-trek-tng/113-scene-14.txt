heels) 
DATA: (Bogart) Hiya Doc. What's cooking? 
CRUSHER: You know I had some trouble getting through. Where's Captain
Picard? 
DATA: He's on ice. 
CRUSHER: Pardon? 
DATA: He's being grilled. 
CRUSHER: What is he, a fish? 
WHALEN: H's being interrogated. They think he's committed a murder. 
CRUSHER: Why aren't we all being interrogated? Maybe I should go and
help him. 
WHALEN: No, relax. He's having the time of his life in there. 
CRUSHER: Well, why should he have all the fun? 
(She sits down and copies the woman next to here by crossing her legs
and pulling up her skirt slightly) 
POLICEMAN: Come on, Toots, let's go.

[Interrogation room]

BELL: Spill it! 
PICARD: I've told you everything I know. 
BELL: Well, you'll just have to tell us again. From the top. From the
top! 
PICARD: Oh, very good. I've read all this before, you know. It's
absolutely as it should be. 
BELL: Spill it!

[Outside Holodeck]

LAFORGE: LaForge to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
LAFORGE: I can't find the Captain, sir. 
RIKER [OC]: I told you, he's in the holodeck.
LAFORGE: I'm at the holodeck. Something's gone wrong.
RIKER [OC]: What are you saying? 
LAFORGE: I can't communicate with him, I can't access the programme,
and I can't open the doors.

Enterprise log, supplemental. First Officer
reporting. Due to an unknown breakdown in the holodeck, we are unable
to contact the Captain.
