[Arkaria base]

DATA: Yes, but Tyrellian laser art is very similar
in both form and composition. 
HUTCH: Of course. You know, funny you should mention that. I used to be
stationed on Tyrellia. 
DATA: Really? Did you know that there are currently five Tyrellians
serving aboard the Enterprise. 
HUTCH: That's fascinating. Not too many people know this, but Tyrellia
is one of only three known inhabited worlds without a magnetic pole. 
DATA: I was aware of that. But are you aware that Tyrellia is one of
seven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever. 
HUTCH: Really? 
TROI: They're still at it. 
RIKER: Non-stop. I have to admit it has a certain strange fascination.
How long can two people talk about nothing? 
(Geordi is helping himself to the buffet when his visor picks up
something.) 
WAITER: Is something wrong? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I was just getting some very strange energy
readings from your table here. 
WAITER: I'm sure it's nothing serious. Perhaps the heating element
under the table is malfunctioning. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I should take a look at it for you. 
ORTON: I'm sure we can handle this, whatever it is, Commander. There's
no need to concern yourself. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe I should look at the heating element. I mean, in
case it 
ORTON: It's all right. Please, don't worry. 
RIKER: What was all that about? 
ORTON: I assure you it's all right. We'll look into it. You don't have
to concern yourself. 
WAITER: Orton, now! 
(Orton knocks Geordi over. The waiter gets a rifle from under the table
and fires it at Geordi, hitting him square in the chest. Orton gets a
gun for himself.) 
HUTCH: What is going on? 
(Orton shoots him) 
ORTON: Stay right where you are.

[Engineering]

SATLER: (a human male) Reduce the plasma pressure
to zero point six percent nominal. 
POMET: (an alien male) Zero point six. 
SATLER: How does the conduit look? 
POMET: It's clear. 
SATLER: All right. The main plasma flow has been shunted to the aft
conduit. We're ready here. 
NEIL: Okay. That should do it. I think. 
KELSEY: (did I mention she's a redhead?) Be sure, Neil. 
NEIL: Yes. Yes, that does it. All right. Transfer five hundred
milligrams from the reserve system to the engine core. 
(Satler does it) 
NEIL: Perfect. 
KELSEY: Adequate. Disable the containment overrides and get the
interlocks off the magnetic seal. Pomet, prepare the transport
assembly. Keep watching the power flow. It might 
(Picard is brought in.) 
KELSEY: Keep working. Where did he come from? 
KIROS: I found him on deck seven. 
KELSEY: Who are you? 
PICARD: My name is Mot. I'm the barber. 
KELSEY: The barber? What the hell are you doing here? Everyone was
supposed to be evacuated to the surface. 
PICARD: Yes, I know. But I wanted to go riding, but I didn't have my
saddle, so I went back to get it and 
KELSEY: Your saddle? 
PICARD: Yes, that's right. It's on deck seven. I left it in the
corridor. And then the power went out and I got lost 
KELSEY: All right, all right, shut up. Shut up! Any sign of Devor? 
KIROS: No. 
KELSEY: Satler. Get down here and keep an eye on our barber. All right,
go see if you can find Devor. Make sure nothing's wrong. 
(Kiros leaves) 
SATLER: Sit down. 
PICARD: All right. Just don't point that thing at me. 
SATLER: Just do what I tell you, and you won't have to worry. 
KELSEY: How long until you're ready? 
POMET: Forty, maybe fifty minutes. 
KELSEY: The baryon sweep hits this compartment in thirty minutes. 
POMET: The field diverter will protect us. 
KELSEY: It's not us I'm worried about, it's that storage unit. I want
the trilithium resin in there and secured before the sweep gets here. I
don't want to take any chances. 
POMET: Understood.
