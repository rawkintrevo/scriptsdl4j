TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD ARGYLE TRAVELLER RIKER WESLEY DATA KOSINSKI

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Message on this has been transmitted to
Starfleet, sir. 
DATA: Which, traveling subspace, they should receive in fifty-one
years, ten months nine weeks, sixteen days 
PICARD: Mister Data! 
DATA: Sir? 
(Kosinski, Riker and Argyle enter) 
KOSINSKI: Captain Picard, I presume? 
RIKER: We're still trying to determine what happened, sir. 
KOSINSKI: The truth is, Captain, I made a mistake. A wonderful,
incredible mistake. 
PICARD: Just explain what brought us here. 
KOSINSKI: As the power grew, I applied the energy asymptomatically. I
anticipated some tilling, but it didn't occur. Now that was my error,
using the Bessel functions at the beginning. 
PICARD: What is he saying, Number One? 
RIKER: To tell the truth, sir, it sounds to me like nonsense to me. But
considering 
PICARD: Considering where we are, we must assume it isn't.

WESLEY: Can I do something to help? I can call my
mother. She's a doctor. 
TRAVELLER: No, there's nothing she can do. I need to rest. I've been
away too long. 
WESLEY: What happened to you, is it part of what happened to the ship? 
TRAVELLER: Please believe me, I mean no harm to this vessel or those in
it. 
WESLEY: Is Mister Kosinski like he sounds? A joke? 
TRAVELLER: No, that's too cruel. He has sensed some small part of it 
WESLEY: That space and time and thought aren't the separate things they
appear to be? I just thought the formula you were using said something
like that. 
TRAVELLER: Boy, don't ever say that again. And especially not at your
age in a world that's not ready for such, such dangerous nonsense.

KOSINSKI: I've always suspected this rate of speed
was possible, of course, but at this level? No, never.
We're going to need new definitions. New parameters. 
ARGYLE: Perhaps you could call it the Kosinski scale. 
KOSINSKI: Why not? Yes, of course. Since I'm the one who has made the
so-called warp barrier meaningless. And, Captain, this must be a
special thrill for you. 
PICARD: Thrill? 
KOSINSKI: As an explorer. In three centuries of space flight, we've
charted just eleven percent of our galaxy. And then we accomplish this.

PICARD: Yes, but isn't the real point, can you do it again? Can you get
us home? 
KOSINSKI: Of course I can. I'll just do what I did before. Coming,
Riker? 
PICARD: Commander Riker will join you in a moment. 
(Kosinski leaves) 
PICARD: Comment is invited. Counsellor? 
TROI: He's convinced he's right. I have no doubt of that. 
WORF: Captain, can you allow a man who has made one mistake back into a
position where he may make another? 
LAFORGE: Captain, what are our options really? I mean, if this guy
can't get us back, who will? 
DATA: Captain, we're here. Why not avail ourselves of this opportunity
for study? There is a giant protostar here in the process of forming.
No other vessel has been out this far. 
PICARD: Spoken like a true Starfleet graduate. It is tempting, eh,
Number One? 
RIKER: Aye, sir, it is. But as they say, sir, you're the Captain. 
PICARD: I know that if Kosinski can get us home, Starfleet can use his
technique to bring back a pure science vessel to do even more. Number
One, tell Kosinski prepare to get us out of here. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: Do you realise how many great
advancements of mankind have been tied to speed? This is a moment in
history. Right here, right now. And your names will be forever linked
with mine. 
WESLEY: Excuse me, Commander Riker. I don't think he did this. I think 
RIKER: Not now, Wes. 
PICARD [OC]: Standing by, Number One. 
WESLEY: But sir, when this all happened, I was watching his assistant 
RIKER: I'm sure it was fascinating, Wesley. I am looking forward to
hearing about it. But not right now. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
KOSINSKI: (to the Traveller) Come on. 
WESLEY: He's too tired. Why don't you do it by yourself? 
KOSINSKI: Yes, why not? 
TRAVELLER: No, I will help. 
KOSINSKI: As you wish.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I've laid in the reciprocal course back,
Captain.

[Engineering]

KOSINSKI: Tell the captain I am ready, First
Officer. 
RIKER: We're ready for you to engage, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: As before

[Bridge]

PICARD: Begin at warp one point five. 
LAFORGE: Warp one point five, sir.
