Q AMANDA CRUSHER DATA

[Amanda's quarters]

Q: Have you been practicing your teleportation? 
AMANDA: Yes. But it's kind of hard. I keep ending up somewhere I don't
want to be. 
Q: Well, it won't do to be sloppy. You should hone your abilities. I
have a wonderful idea. Why don't we play a little game?
I'll hide somewhere on the ship and you find me. 
AMANDA: But how do I know how? 
(Q vanishes) 
Q [OC]: Don't worry, Amanda. You can do it. 
[Shuttlebay two]

(Amanda reveals that Q has disguised himself as a
container) 
Q: Not bad. Not bad at all.

[Engineering]

DATA: If we can use phase buffers we may be able to
devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system while
it is in operation. 
(Amanda appears. Data and Geordi stare at her. She's about to leave
when Q sticks his head out of the warp core) 
Q: You're still thinking like a human.

[Enterprise hull]

(They are standing on the rear hull, and Amanda is
entranced by being in space.)

[Amanda's quarters]

Q: Now do you understand? What do humans have to
offer you that even begins to compare with that? Your future contains
wonders you can't even imagine. The universe could be your playground. 
(doorbell) 
AMANDA: Doctor Crusher and Counsellor Troi. They're taking me to
dinner. 
Q: You don't have to eat, you know. It's a nasty human habit you could
easily do without. 
(Q vanishes and Amanda opens the door) 
CRUSHER: Hello, Amanda. Are you ready? 
AMANDA: Yes.
