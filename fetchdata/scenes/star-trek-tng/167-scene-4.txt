PICARD TROI RIKER

[Turbolift]

RIKER: So, have you decided where you're going yet?

PICARD: Yes I have, Number One. Bridge. 
RIKER: No, I meant on your shore leave. 
PICARD: Not you too. 
RIKER: Halt. I know this perfect little vacation spot. In fact, it
falls within the coordinates of this sector. 
PICARD: How convenient. Except, Number One, I have absolutely no
intention of taking a holiday. Is that clear? 
RIKER: Very clear. 
PICARD: Good. I'm glad we've got that straightened out. Resume. 
RIKER: The place is called Risa, and believe me, Captain, it is a
paradise. Warm tropical breezes, exotic food. Nothing to do but sit
around all day and enjoy the quiet. And then 
PICARD + RIKER: The women. 
PICARD: Of course. 
RIKER: I'm sure you would find their sybaritic outlook on life very
appealing. 
PICARD: Oh, I'm sure. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I'm glad to hear you say so, sir. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, this vessel is about to undergo extensive
repairs requiring my personal supervision. 
RIKER: What about Risa? 
PICARD: Some other time, Number One. 
TROI: Will, I've just had some terrific news. 
RIKER: Really? 
TROI: There's an excellent chance my mother may be joining us on
Starbase twelve. 
PICARD: Your mother? 
TROI: She's returning home from a conference on Achrady Seven, and
she's going to try to rearrange her schedule so she can spend some time
visiting with us. 
RIKER: That's wonderful, Deanna. 
TROI: She mentioned how much she was looking forward to seeing you
again, Captain. 
PICARD: Did she? Commander, could I have a word with you? 
(As Riker and Picard leave, Deanna clasps her hands and mouths Yes!)
