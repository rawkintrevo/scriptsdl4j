RIKER: I've practised my best Academy courtesy, now
it's time for you to go. 
KYLE: It's time for us to have a talk, so lower your shields. 
RIKER: I'm asking you to leave, or I'll 
KYLE: You'll what? You know, it's a shame there's no anbo-jyutsu ring
nearby. 
RIKER: Really? There is. Deck Twelve. The gymnasium.

RIKER: You're on.

KYLE: Scuttlebutt says you wanted to see me. 
PULASKI: That's right. I thought I knew you, Kyle.

PULASKI: Then what is this I hear about an anbo-jyutsu match with Will?

KYLE: You've heard.

PULASKI: And suppose one of you is injured? 
KYLE: I know where to find a good doctor. Kate 
PULASKI: Kyle. 
KYLE: Will and I have been playing anbo-jyutsu ever since he was eight

PULASKI: Don't take this personally, but Will is in his prime. 
KYLE: And I'm no spring chicken, I know. Don't worry. He's never been
able to beat me.

DATA: Computer, is this it? 
COMPUTER: Correct. Klingon Rite of Ascension Chamber. 
LAFORGE: Is this really necessary? 
WESLEY: If we want to get Worf through his problem, it is. 
DATA: Computer, please give us Klingon personnel appropriate to this
event.

painstiks) 
DATA: These images are specifically programmed for Ascension rites. 
LAFORGE: Cute bunch. 
WESLEY: And they use those? 
O'BRIEN: Those are Klingon painstiks. I once saw one of them used
against a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor creature jumped five metres at
the slightest touch. It finally died from excessive cephalic pressures.

WESLEY: You mean? 
O'BRIEN: That's right. The animal's head exploded like 
PULASKI: I think that's enough, Chief O'Brien.
