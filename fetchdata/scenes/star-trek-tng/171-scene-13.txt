little question hey broken charge officer want outbreak come

[Ten Forward]

(Three men in science blue sit at a table that
O'Brien and a friend are walking to) 
O'BRIEN: Excuse me, we were sitting here. 
CREWMAN: Well we're sitting here now. 
O'BRIEN: Come on, fella. This is our table. 
CREWMAN: Really? Funny, I don't see your name on it. 
O'BRIEN: Didn't your mother teach you manners? 
(They square up to each other) 
LAFORGE: Hey, hey guys. Is there some kind of problem here? 
O'BRIEN: There seems to be a question of who's table this is. 
LAFORGE: There are plenty of other tables, right? 
O'BRIEN: I suppose you're right. 
LAFORGE: Why don't I get everyone another round of drinks? All right?

[Corridor]

RIKER: I don't need to tell you that
insubordination is a serious charge to level against any officer. 
WORF: I am aware of that, Commander. However, Ensign D'Amato directly
challenged my authority. 
RIKER: Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on
this ship lately? 
WORF: I hadn't noticed. 
[Ten Forward]

(And they walk straight into an old-fashioned bar
brawl) 
WORF: I see what you mean. 
(Worf stops two men strangling Geordi) 
WORF: Security team to Ten Forward. 
RIKER: Geordi, what the hell is going on here? 
LAFORGE: I wish I knew. 
RIKER: All right, that's enough! 
(And he gets punched in the face) 
(Later, the staff are clearing up the broken furniture, and the medics
the broken crew) 
LAFORGE: The next thing I know somebody's left hook is on its way to my
chin. 
TROI: Captain, this is not an isolated incident. There have been
reports of random violence all over the ship. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting this is somehow contagious? 
CRUSHER: There's no indication of any bacteria or virus. I've run every
test I know. I've checked the water, food replicators, airborne
samples. 
PICARD: This is a hell of a time. Whatever it is, I don't want it to
affect the Ambassador. I want his quarters isolated from the rest of
the crew until we've identified the cause. 
TROI: It's not that simple, Captain. 
CRUSHER: We have determined that the outbreak of violence started at
virtually the same time Sarek and his party beamed onto the ship.
