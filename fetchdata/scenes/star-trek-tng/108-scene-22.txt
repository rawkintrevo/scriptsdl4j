(Wesley is at an auxiliary console) 
WESLEY: How about here, Mister Singh? If the control network breaks at
this point 
SINGH: It bleeds warp engine commands off into dead ends. Excellent. I
believe I can handle it from here, Mister Crusher. 
WESLEY: But, sir 
SINGH: You are scheduled for class work now. Sorry. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. But I don't learn nearly this much in school. 
SINGH: I tend to agree, but the captain's orders on this are very
clear.

[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: Hi. Solve any new problems today? 
WESLEY: I was starting to, maybe. Mister Singh sent me off to class. 
CRUSHER: Wes, you're only an acting ensign. You've got to let the
commissioned officers do some of the work. 
WESLEY: Mom, I've learned a more than they understand. For example, the
Channing's dilithium crystals theory I was telling you about? 
CRUSHER: When were you telling me about that? 
WESLEY: This morning. Don't you remember? 
CRUSHER: Honestly, I don't remember.

(Singh taps at a console, then the blue energy zaps
into his body and throws him onto the floor. Worf finds him) 
WORF: Engineering to Captain Picard. Security alert. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard. 
WORF: Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found Mister Singh. He's dead.

Captain's log, stardate 41249.4. I've ordered an
immediate investigation into the death of Assistant Chief Engineer
Singh. We continue to run on impulse power.

[Engineer's office]

WESLEY: He could have been working there, restoring
warp power. 
LAFORGE: According to these readings, we could go back to warp speed
now. 
WESLEY: Those aren't the same readings as when I left. 
WORF: Singh probably repaired it just before he was killed. 
WESLEY: He couldn't have repaired, sir. The problems were inside the
engine. 
LAFORGE: Who else could have corrected it, Wes? Inform the bridge of
engine status. 
WORF: Engineering to Bridge. We now have warp capacity, sir. All power
on line.
