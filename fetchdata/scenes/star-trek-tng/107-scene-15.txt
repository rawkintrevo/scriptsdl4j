RIKER KAYRON MORDOC LETEK PORTAL CRUSHER

[Bridge]

(The ship whirrs back into life, and people start
to open their eyes) 
CRUSHER: Not a moment too soon, Jean. I mean, Captain.

[Planet surface]

PORTAL: I admit I had my doubts as your ships
battled each other in overt acts of
belligerence. Normally, I would have destroyed all of you and your
ships, but something confused me. 
RIKER: Which was? 
PORTAL: First, you wanted to murder each other. Then you were willing
to help each other. 
LETEK: What of our vessel? We knew the same answer. 
MORDOC: The truth is, I gave those words to this human. 
PORTAL: What of them? Shall I destroy them? 
RIKER: Then they would learn nothing. 
PORTAL: A most interesting conclusion. But what if they will never
learn, Riker? 
RIKER: Is this a test also? 
PORTAL: In life, one is always tested. 
RIKER: I find them very much as we were a several hundred years ago,
but possessing the technology they have now, they're very dangerous . 
KAYRON: Untrue. We seek friendship with you. 
RIKER: But we can hardly hate what we once were. They may grow and
learn. 
PORTAL: And learn ways to destroy you. 
RIKER: Our values require us to face that possibility. What of you,
with your empire gone? 
PORTAL: The universe exists to me to create life. I shall sleep, until
needed again.
