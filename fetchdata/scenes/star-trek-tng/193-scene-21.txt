LARSON TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER COMPUTER EINSTEIN CRUSHER BARCLAY

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Where's Lieutenant Barclay? 
LARSON: I stopped by his quarters on my way over. He wasn't there. 
LAFORGE: Computer, location of Lieutenant Barclay. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay is on holodeck three.

[Holodeck]

EINSTEIN: G sub I, J of t as t approaches infinity.

BARCLAY: G of t over G naught. 
EINSTEIN: So it is, so it is. 
BARCLAY: I still don't see how you're going to incorporate quantum
principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological
constant a lot more than you're doing here. 
EINSTEIN: If we increase the value as you suggest, we must face the
possibility of twenty six dimensions, instead of ten. 
BARCLAY: I don't think I could deal with that. 
EINSTEIN: I certainly could not. 
BARCLAY: If the semiset curved into the subatomic, the infinities might
cancel each other out. 
EINSTEIN: Gruss Gott. They just might. 
LAFORGE: We had a meeting at oh seven hundred. 
BARCLAY: I'm sorry, Commander. Thank you, Professor. End programme. 
[Corridor]

LAFORGE: What was that all about? 
BARCLAY: I had some ideas late last night. I needed to consult with the
computer about some quantum electrodynamic calculations. A holodeck
Einstein programme seemed like the best way. I guess I went a little
overboard. 
LAFORGE: A little? Most of the stuff on that blackboard was way out of
my league. And yours too. 
BARCLAY: Not really. I just haven't thought along those lines before.
It's all pretty evident now, and if you were to put your mind to it I'm
sure 
LAFORGE: Reg, ever since our run in with that probe, something's
different about you. 
BARCLAY: What, because I'm beginning to behave like the rest of the
crew? With confidence in what I'm doing? 
LAFORGE: You just spent the entire night arguing grand unification
theories with Albert Einstein! 
BARCLAY: Yes, but 
LAFORGE: Reg, something's happened to you, and we can't ignore that. 
BARCLAY: Yes. I've finally become the person I've always wanted to be.
Do we have to ask why? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I think we do.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Incredible! The production of
neurotransmitters in your brain has jumped by over five hundred
percent. Pre and postsynaptic membranes have increased permeability to
match it. I couldn't even guess at your IQ level now. 
BARCLAY: Probably somewhere between twelve hundred and fourteen fifty. 
CRUSHER: But that isn't all. The corpus callosum, the connecting bridge
between both sides of the brain, it is so
active now that the hemispheres are essentially behaving as one. 
LAFORGE: So, it's not just raw intelligence we're talking about here. 
CRUSHER: No. Creativity, resourcefulness, inspiration, imagination,
they've all been enhanced. Lieutenant, you could very well be the most
advanced human being who has ever lived.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Whatever that alien probe did to him,
Barclay now seems to know more about the internal workings of the
Enterprise than anyone else on board. 
PICARD: The question is, how are we going to deal with it. 
RIKER: We could confine him to his quarters. 
LAFORGE: How can we do that? What's he done? We're talking about
locking a man up for being too smart. 
RIKER: If he's been influenced by an alien, wouldn't that put us all at
risk? 
CRUSHER: Not necessarily. It might be something as simple as an
allergic reaction to a bee sting. 
PICARD: Has Mister Barclay done anything that could be considered
potentially threatening? 
TROI: Well, he did make a pass at me last night. (Riker and La Forge
stare) A good one. 
LAFORGE: I'd hardly consider that a threat. 
TROI: No, but it's certainly unusual behaviour for Barclay. 
CRUSHER: There's something else, Captain. He taught violin technique at
the music school last night. 
RIKER: I didn't know Barclay played the violin. 
CRUSHER: He didn't, not until last night. 
LAFORGE: Look, if we want to save the array, we need Barclay. It's as
simple as that. 
PICARD: Until he does something more menacing, I see no reason why we
should prevent him from continuing his work. 
LARSON [OC]: Larson to Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Go ahead, Lieutenant.
