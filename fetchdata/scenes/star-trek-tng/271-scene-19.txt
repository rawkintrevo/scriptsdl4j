(Dern is dead, with scratches across his chest) 
DATA: His upper spinal column has been broken in three places. 
PICARD: It looks like he's been attacked by some sort of animal. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Has his DNA been changed as well? 
DATA: Yes, sir. However, it was in its initial stages when he died.
Captain, I am picking up one thousand and eleven individual life forms
within the ship. All exhibit a similar genetic flux to the one we
observed in Counsellor Troi. 
PICARD: So the entire ship has been affected. 
DATA: Most of the lifeforms are scattered throughout the ship. However,
there are several large concentrations in the arboretum and the aquatic
lab. 
PICARD: I've regained attitude control for the ship, but main power is
still offline. It looks as though the entire power transfer grid has
been destroyed. 
(there's thumping from the ready room)

[Ready room]

(Riker is trying to get at Livingston the fish.
He's hairy and brutish and his uniform has split at the shoulders) 
PICARD: Will? 
DATA: Captain. His cranial plates have thickened by twenty percent. His
brain is much smaller, sir. I do not believe he can comprehend our
language. 
PICARD: Perhaps we can find a way to communicate. Will, can you
understand what it is that 
(Riker attacks Picard and Data stuns him using two shots) 
PICARD: He looks almost proto-human. 
DATA: Yes, sir. His DNA would seem to confirm that observation.
Captain, I believe the crew is de-evolving.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: This tranquilliser should keep him
unconscious for another seven hours. What have you found out? 
DATA: I have analysed Commander Riker's DNA structure. A synthetic
T-cell has invaded his genetic codes. This T-cell has begun to activate
his latent introns. 
PICARD: Introns? 
DATA: They are genetic codes which are normally dormant. They are
evolutionary holdovers, sequences of DNA that provided key behavioural
and physical characteristics millions of years ago, but are no longer
necessary. For instance, Counsellor Troi's gill slits and other
amphibious characteristics were derived from introns which still
contain amphibious codes. 
PICARD: So these introns are causing her DNA to re-combine in an
earlier configuration? 
DATA: That is correct. In her case, the DNA has created an amphibious
lifeform which became extinct over fifty million years ago. 
PICARD: And Commander Riker's introns are changing him into what
appears to be one of the earlier hominids. 
DATA: Yes, sir. I would say Australopithecine. Each of these stages is
another link in the evolutionary chain which stretches back to the
origins of all lifeforms on Earth. Because introns can include genetic
material from many different species over millions of years of
evolution, it is possible that a wide variety of transformations is
occurring among the crew. 
PICARD: What about those crewmembers who are not from Earth? 
DATA: All humanoid life has a similar genetic pattern. The virus should
work on non-human crewmembers in the same way. They are each
de-evolving to earlier forms of life on their homeworlds. I feel I must
inform you, sir, you have also been infected by the intron virus. 
PICARD: How long before I begin to change? 
DATA: According to my calculations, within the next twelve hours, you
will begin to exhibit the first signs of your eventual transformation. 
PICARD: And what will that be 
DATA: I believe you will also de-evolve into some form of early
primate. Possibly similar to a lemur, or a pygmy marmoset.
PICARD: Well, before I begin swinging through the ship looking for
breakfast, we'd better find some answers. How do we reverse the
process? 
DATA: I am uncertain. We will need to run several microcellular scans.
However, the ship's main computer has been damaged. Captain, the
computer in my quarters has an independent processing and memory
storage unit. It should not be affected. I suggest we start from there.

PICARD: Agreed.
