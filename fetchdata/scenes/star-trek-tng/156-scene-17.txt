RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD WESLEY ARRIDOR CRUSHER

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Whatever he's got is obviously not life
threatening. It's some kind of system-wide histaminic reaction. He
certainly can't go back to negotiations for several days. 
PICARD: Will you keep me informed? 
[Corridor]

PICARD: The Federation's top negotiator taken out
by a mysterious ailment. Suspicions? 
RIKER: With the Ferengi around? Always. 
PICARD: You'll have to fill in, Number One. 
RIKER: Me? 
PICARD: Well, I'm the designated host. It would be a most awkward
transition. You're the next likely choice. And Mister Mendoza
will certainly agree. He's quite impressed by your natural instincts. 
RIKER: Excuse me, sir, but those weren't natural instincts. Those were
poker instincts. A card game doesn't exactly prepare me for this. 
PICARD: Yes, the stakes are higher. But then, isn't that when the game
gets interesting, Commander?

[Bridge]

WESLEY: The wormhole will reappear in thirty
seconds, sir. 
WORF: The Ferengi pod is moving into position. 
PICARD: Shuttle nine, stand by. 
[Shuttlepod]

LAFORGE: Ferengi pod, this is Lieutenant Commander
La Forge in the Enterprise shuttle. 
ARRIDOR [OC]: This is Doctor Arridor, go ahead. 
LAFORGE: Would you care to take the point, Doctor?

[Ferengi pod]

ARRIDOR: We will gladly yield that honour to you,
Lieutenant Commander.
