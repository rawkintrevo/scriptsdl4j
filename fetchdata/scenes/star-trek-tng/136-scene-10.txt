[Salia's quarters]

WESLEY: Really, it's quite simple. You just tell
the computer what you want and it prepares it for you. 
SALIA: Oh. What should I order? 
WESLEY: I don't know. what do you like? 
SALIA: I'd like something sweet. 
WESLEY: I know. Computer, Thalian chocolate mousse. 
(Salia samples it with her finger) 
SALIA: It's a wonderful sensation. 
WESLEY: On Thalos Seven they age the beans four hundred years. 
SALIA: You've been there? 
WESLEY: It's one of my favourite places. 
SALIA: It must be fun to visit a planet like that. 
WESLEY: It's the best part of being on the Enterprise. 
SALIA: I've studied about some of them, but to see them, that would be
wonderful. Tell me about some of the other
places you've been. 
WESLEY: Oh, there's too many. 
SALIA: The only world I've known is Klavdia Three. 
WESLEY: It's about time we changed that. 
SALIA: How? 
WESLEY: Come with me.

[Sickbay]

(Worf and Anya enter) 
PULASKI: I'll be with you in a moment. 
ANYA: What's wrong with him? 
PULASKI: Andronesian encephalitis. 
ANYA: That disease is contagious. 
PULASKI: Very unlikely. Our air filtering system can handle 
ANYA: But there is a chance. 
PULASKI: If you mean mathematically, yes, the probability is not zero. 
ANYA: I cannot rely on your primitive technologies. Kill the patient! 
PULASKI: What? 
ANYA: Destroy the patient. Immediately! 
PULASKI: Now, you calm down. 
ANYA: If you won't take action, then I will! 
(She morphs into a big nasty version of the furry creature she was with
Salia) 
PULASKI: Security to Sickbay! Hurry! 
(Worf wrestles with the creature which is larger than himself, as
Picard and guards arrive) 
PICARD: Wait! Hold your fire. 
(Anya returns to humanoid shape) 
PICARD: Worf! 
PULASKI: What is she? Keep her away! 
ANYA: Do not interfere! 
PULASKI: She wants to kill Hennesey! 
ANYA: His disease threatens Salia. 
PULASKI: Captain, there is no chance of contagion. 
PICARD: The situation is under control. 
ANYA: That's not good enough! 
PICARD: Well, it will have to be. 
ANYA: Your powers are infinitesimal compared to mine. 
PICARD: Yes, that may be, but you will obey my orders. You are to
remain in your quarters and in your present form for the rest of this
voyage. Is that clear? 
ANYA: Very. 
PICARD: Keep her under guard. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Anya stalks out) 
WORF: Wait for me. What kind of creature is she? 
PICARD: I've never seen anything like her. 
PULASKI: There is mention in the galactic zoological catalogue of a
species called allasomorph, which is supposed to possess the power to
alter their molecular structure into other life forms. 
WORF: Such a creature would make a perfect protector. 
PICARD: I want a Security team stationed outside Sickbay, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Captain, what if Anya transforms? 
PICARD: Improvise.
