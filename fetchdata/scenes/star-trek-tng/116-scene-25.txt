WESLEY: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Bridge, this is main Engineering. 
WESLEY [OC]: This is the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Are you running any test programs up there? 
WESLEY [OC]: No. 
LAFORGE: Are the Bynars? 
WESLEY [OC]: Not to my knowledge. Is there a problem? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. There's no one on duty here, and we're getting
some very strange readings from the magnetic containment field. 
DATA: The field is deteriorating. Contact the captain immediately. I am
initiating Red Alert. 
LAFORGE: Data, I can't maintain the integrity of the containment field.

DATA: Engineering to Captain. (no reply) If the antimatter is released,
the ship will be destroyed. 
LAFORGE: Nothing I do has any effect. I'm losing it. Data, I've
rechecked every circuit. This is not a misread by the computer. 
DATA: Computer, situation analysis. 
COMPUTER: (male voice) Estimate release of antimatter in four minutes
eighteen seconds. Seventeen seconds. Sixteen seconds. 
DATA: Engineering to Bridge. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: This is the bridge. 
[Engineering]

DATA: Alert starbase. Inform them we are abandoning
the ship. Tell them why. Initiate automated sequence for departure. Set
course and speed course and speed to put maximum distance between the
Enterprise and any inhabited planets. 
[Bridge]

WESLEY: Shouldn't we wait for the Captain's
approval? 
DATA [OC]: There is no time. 
[Engineering]

DATA: Based on all information presently available,
the decision is correct. This is Lieutenant Commander Data speaking for
the Captain. Abandon ship. This is not a drill. All personnel. This is
not a drill. (around the ship) I say again, abandon ship. All
personnel, this is not a drill. 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Abandon ship.
