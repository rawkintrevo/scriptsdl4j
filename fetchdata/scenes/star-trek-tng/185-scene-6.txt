[Ready room]

PICARD: Mister Data, based on your analysis, what
is the current Romulan strategy behind the deployment of their ships in
this sector? 
DATA: Their ships are deployed to support a policy of confrontation
designed to test Federation defenses along the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Do you predict any change in the near future? 
DATA: I project a ninety percent probability that they will continue to
support that policy. 
PICARD: Is there any indication of a more conciliatory attitude on
their part? 
DATA: No, sir. 
T'PEL: Caution is clearly called for, Captain. However, the mission
must proceed as planned. 
PICARD: Starfleet Command agrees with you, but I would feel better if
you would consent to an escort or 
(one look cuts him off) 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data.

[Data's quarters]

DATA: Feline supplement seventy four. 
(he puts the bowl down and a hairy ginger cat eats it) 
DATA: Computer, run fluidic sensor diagnostic. 
(the cat jumps on his lap, and he strokes it) 
COMPUTER: Diagnostic complete. All systems functioning within normal
parameters. 
DATA: Come in. 
O'BRIEN: Am I intruding, Commander? 
DATA: No. Would you care to sit down? 
DATA [OC]: When one of my friends is distraught, I have learnt that the
thoughtful thing to do is to attempt to make him feel more comfortable.

(But O'Brien can't settle) 
DATA: May I offer you some refreshment, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: No, thank you, sir. First of all I'd like to apologise for
this morning in Ten Forward 
DATA: There is no need to apologise. I was not offended. Would you like
a pillow or a more comfortable chair to sit upon? 
O'BRIEN: No, sir. Thank you, sir. 
DATA: Perhaps you would like some music? Brahms? Aurelia? 
O'BRIEN: No, really, sir I'm fine. I came to ask for your help. It's
about Keiko. I'd like you to talk to her. Convince her to go through
with the wedding. 
DATA: Would Counsellor Troi not be a more appropriate choice to speak
with Keiko? 
O'BRIEN: She already has. It didn't help. You've known her longer than
I have. I just thought she might listen to you. She won't even talk to
me 
DATA: I do not know what to say to her. 
O'BRIEN: Just talk with her. Make her see reason. She's going off
half-cocked, not thinking this through. You've worked with her for a
long time. She respects your opinion. 
DATA: Perhaps she has not fully analysed her decision. I will try. 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. I won't forget this. 
DATA [OC]: Commander Maddox, I noted that Keiko was quite calm and
rational when she informed me of her decision this morning. Therefore,
I can predict that she will respond to an objective analysis of the
situation based on the available facts. It is fortunate that she has
not let emotional considerations cloud her judgement. It should make my
task much simpler.
