[Bridge]

PICARD: What's the next step, Mister Data? 
[Laboratory]

DATA: I will need to add a specific amount of
antimatter to rebalance and align the system. 
PICARD [OC]: Will that plug the hole? 
DATA: Theoretically, yes. In reality I do not know. 
(He opens a container and gets the antimatter, putting it on the end of
a long rod) 
DATA: When the effect hits, the forcefields will align, opening a clean
straight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, I
must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if the
Professor was right, I will need a twenty seven second countdown. 
LAFORGE [OC]: You got it, Data. 
DATA: Captain, I now have the antimatter and am moving towards the
opening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occur
within seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. 
(There's a big sparkle. Data looks back to see himself midway across
the lab - no 2 - and getting the antimatter - no 3. Meanwhile, Geordi's
voice is counting down, very echoy)
DATA 3: Captain, there appear to be three of us. 
DATA 1: Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? 
DATA 3: Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. 
DATA 1: Which one? 
DATA 2: Me. It's me. 
GEORDI [OC]: Five, four, three, two, one. 
(The middle Data arrives at number 1 and the antimatter goes in, before
number 3 gets there. The effect stops. There is only one Data) 
PICARD [OC]: Data, report. Are you all right? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Is it closed? 
DATA: It is well patched, sir. Closed indicates a permanent condition,
which I cannot guarantee. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Patched is good enough. Well done. Beam
back immediately. 
[Laboratory]

DATA: With pleasure, sir.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This is amazing. All your readings are
completely normal. 
(Picard enters) 
MANHEIM: Where is my wife? Is she all right? 
CRUSHER: She's right here. 
MANHEIM: Jenice. 
JENICE: Paul. 
MANHEIM: The effect has been reversed. I can feel it. We're safe. 
JENICE: How is he? 
CRUSHER: He needs rest. There might be some residual effects, but other
than that, he'll be all right. 
MANHEIM: I feel like I'm coming out of a long tunnel. It's there. Not
at all like I thought it would be. Different. 
JENICE: Describe it. 
MANHEIM: I can't, not yet. The only words that fit are too pale because
the images are so vibrant. It's not like anything anyone has ever
experienced before. There was, no, no, there is this kind of life. Not
like us. Not like this. What's the condition of my lab? 
PICARD: Intact, for the most part. 
JENICE: Don't tell me we're going back? 
MANHEIM: Oh, Jenice, we are so close. We have learned so much to walk
away. Besides, we owe it to the others, our friends. There have been so
many sacrifices by so many good people. 
JENICE: We'll be going back. 
PICARD: Yes, I can see that. I'm sure the Federation will want to help
in any way that it can. 
MANHEIM: Thank you. This time it will be different, I promise. 
JENICE: It always is, my love. You said my life would never be dull,
and it never has been. 
MANHEIM: Thank you. 
[Outside Holodeck]

(Troi and Jenice step out of the turbolift next to
the holodeck door) 
TROI: Computer, this is Counsellor Troi. Request access. 
COMPUTER: Do you wish to terminate the current programme? 
TROI: No, continue the programme. 
COMPUTER: Enter when ready. 
TROI: The Captain is waiting for you inside. 
[Cafe des Artistes]

JENICE: How is this possible? It's Paris.
Unbelievable. 
EDOUARD: Madame, this way. The Captain is waiting for you. 
(The wine is on ice) 
JENICE: This is so real. 
EDOUARD: Bien sur. Pourquoi pas? 
JENICE: Jean-Luc, don't tell me how you did it. I don't care. It's
perfect. It's as if we were really there. 
PICARD: I wanted to say goodbye properly this time. I shall always
picture you here. 
(They toast each other) 
JENICE: I expect you to always come charging to my rescue. 
PICARD: I'll do my best. 
JENICE: Goodbye, Jean-Luc. Be well. 
PICARD: And you. 
JENICE: Thank you for Paris. 
(She walks away, but) 
JENICE: Well, so much for my dramatically romantic exit. 
(The door appears and opens)
