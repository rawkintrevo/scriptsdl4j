GUEST1: I'll contact the authorities. 
APGAR: No, I'll take care of that. 
PICARD: Freeze. 
(Apgar has sat down in front of a computer console) 
PICARD: Tayna, exactly is Apgar doing here? 
GUEST1: Activating the generator on the planet. 
PICARD: Why would he do that? 
GUEST1: Maybe he was going to work on the converter, I don't know. 
PICARD: Maybe he was already thinking ahead to his next confrontation
with Commander Riker. Computer, play Riker programme four, time index
twenty four one. 
APGAR: What are you going to put in your report, Riker? That there's no
justification for all the extra
dicosilium I've requested? That is why they sent you early, isn't it? 
RIKER: Doctor. 
APGAR: I can explain why I needed it. They have no idea what my
problems are. There are explanations for all of it. 
RIKER: I don't need explanations. 
PICARD: Freeze. To Apgar, this must have seemed as though Commander
Riker were confirming his worst fears. And I believe it was now that he
decided finally to kill him. 
KRAG: You forget, Picard, we know the energy pulse which blew up the
reactor originated from Commander Riker's position, not Doctor Apgar's.

LAFORGE: We are hypothesising that Doctor Apgar energised the converter
at the moment of Commander Riker's beam-out, hoping to make his death
look like a transporter accident. But something went wrong. The energy
pulse hit the transporter beam and reflected back to the reactor, which
caused the explosion. 
KRAG: An interesting hypothesis. But impossible to prove. 
LAFORGE: Not really. We know that the field generator on the planet has
been repeating a discharge ever since the explosion. The intervals are
like clockwork, except the explosion occurred point zero zero one four
seconds after the initial discharge. And the only explanation for that
variance is the time it would take the energy pulse to bounce back from
the transporter beam to the reactor. 
PICARD: We've arranged a demonstration to illustrate. Mister La Forge,
I think it's about time, isn't it? 
LAFORGE: Computer, load programme, La Forge one. Coordinate auto-engage
time sequence. The next discharge from the field generator is scheduled
to occur in just a few moments, and we've aligned the holodeck
programme to recreate the final events as Commander Riker described
them. Only this time our facsimile will automatically process the
energy charge from the planet and reflect it just as the original
convertor did before the explosion. 
PICARD: If we're correct, we'll know it instantly. 
COMPUTER: Auto-engage time sequence synchronised. 
APGAR: Then we have nothing further to say to each other. 
RIKER: I'll tell my Captain to expect your grievance. 
APGAR: Do that. 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready to leave, now. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport. 
(The top of the converter lights up. A beam goes out to Riker and
bounces back to the middle of the machine. There's one small explosion,
then a bigger one. The programme is terminated and we are in a bare)
