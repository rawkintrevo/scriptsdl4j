PICARD: How long will it take to programme the
phasers, Number One? 
RIKER: We've just got to tie in Geordi's atmospheric sensors. 
RASMUSSEN: So you've made your choice after all, and without my help. 
PICARD: Oh, on the contrary, Professor, you were quite helpful. 
RASMUSSEN: How's that? 
PICARD: By refusing to assist me, you left me with the same choice I
had to began with. To try or not to try, to take a risk or to play it
safe. Your arguments have reminded me how precious the right to choose
is. And because I've never been one to play it safe, I choose to try.
Mister Data, programme the firing sequence. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

Captain's log, stardate 45351.9. Doctor Moseley has
met with the colony leaders, who all agree they are willing to take the
risk.

WORF: Warp power has being rerouted to the main
deflector dish, Commander. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Keep those phasers on active surge control,
Worf. We're only going to get one shot at this. 
RASMUSSEN: Well, this is it! 
RIKER: You have the sequence locked in, Data? 
DATA: Yes, sir. After an eight point three second burst from the dish,
we'll discharge all EPS taps through the phasers. 
PICARD: It's time for you return to the ship, Mister La Forge. Mister
O'Brien, stand by to transport. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Excuse me, Captain, but I can be of a lot more
help down here. We've going to have to compensate for density
variations right up to the last second. 
DATA: Doctor Moseley's computers can accomplish the same task, sir. but
Geordi would be better able to anticipate unexpected variances. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, you know better than anyone there's no
guarantee this will work. If it fails 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: There's no guarantee it's going to fail,
Captain. I'd like your permission to remain here on the surface. 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
RASMUSSEN: La Forge remained below. 
PICARD: Good luck, Commander. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Thank you, Captain. 
(transmission ends) 
DATA: The deflector dish has been reconfigured, Captain. 
RIKER: Proceed, Mister Data. 
DATA: Stand by for auto-phaser interlock. Activating deflector beam. 
WORF: EPS taps online. Phasers firing. 
(a wicked red glow quickly spreads through the atmosphere, and is then
pushed back into a single point by azure blue. A stream of energy leaps
out at the Enterprise and envelopes it) 
DATA: Activating shield invertors, now. 
(Enterprise does a neat 180 and pours the energy off into space) 
PICARD: Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: La Forge here. Still breathing, Captain. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: We've got particulate levels right where
they're supposed to be and the sun is shining! 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: You see, Captain, I told you there was nothing
to worry about. 
PICARD: Report back to the ship when you're ready, Commander. Doctor,
we'll stay in orbit and analyse the remaining volcanic disturbances,
but the best advice would be to let them cool down on their own. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: I'm getting in the habit of thanking you,
Picard. 
(transmission ends) 
RASMUSSEN: Well, I'd love to see more, but it's nearly time for me to
go. I am tickled pink to have had the opportunity of witnessing this,
Picard. And you did it all without any help. well, must run. Got some
packing to do. You know, you're taller in person, Commander. 
(Rasmussen leaves, and Picard gives Worf the nod)
