(Riker is sitting disconsolate as Geordi splashes
towards him through the water) 
LAFORGE: There you are. What's wrong? 
RIKER: Something jabbed me here in the calf. 
(The fabric is torn, the flesh bloody and swollen) 
LAFORGE: O'Brien, Commander Riker's been injured. Lock on and bring him
up. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Stand by. 
RIKER: Geordi, it's just 
LAFORGE: A scratch. Right. Sorry, Commander. We can't take any chances.
We're the first survey team to set foot on this planet. We don't know
what the risks are.

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE [OC]: O'Brien, what's the hold up? 
O'BRIEN: The transporter's detected unidentified microbes in Commander
Riker's body. 
[Steamy mangrove swamp]

LAFORGE: Well, can't the bio-filter screen them
out? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Apparently not.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: But Doctor Pulaski has been notified. 
[Steamy mangrove swamp]

LAFORGE: Acknowledged. 
RIKER: I wasn't ready to leave here anyway. 

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Here's the biofilter's analysis of the
microbes. 
PULASKI: That's not much to go on. 
O'BRIEN: I can override and beam Commander Riker aboard . 
PULASKI: No. I'd better go down and make an evaluation there. 
(She takes a deep, reluctant breath and gets on the pad) 
O'BRIEN: I hope these are the right coordinates. Just kidding, Doctor.
I know how much you love the transporter. 
PULASKI: About as much as I love comical Transporter Chiefs. 
O'BRIEN: Ready?
