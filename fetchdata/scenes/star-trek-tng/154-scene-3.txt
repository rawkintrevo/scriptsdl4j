PICARD RIKER DATA WORF

[Bridge]

RIKER: We're picking up a signal, coordinates two
one one mark six one. 
PICARD: It would seen to be an ancient interplanetary code. Mister
Data? 
DATA: Confirmed, sir. 
RIKER: Survivors on Orelious Nine after all this time? Not possible. 
PICARD: Well, hardly possible, Number One. Lay in a course to the
source of the signal. 
(short trip through the rubble) 
DATA: Approaching the source, Captain. 
PICARD: Put it on the viewer. 
WORF: A Promellian battle cruiser? 
PICARD: With its Lang-cycle fusion engines still intact. 
DATA: Sensors indicate no life signs aboard, Captain. 
PICARD: I should hope not, Mister Data. That ship belongs in a museum.
I'm afraid we're a little late. That call for help was probably
initiated over a thousand years ago.

Captain's log, Stardate 43205.6. We have arrived at
Orelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars and
Promellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we have
found a relic, a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the
centuries. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Indulge me, Number One. 
RIKER: I would prefer it if Lieutenant Worf and I were able to a
security sweep of the ship first. 
PICARD: No. Captain's prerogative. This one's mine. We have examined
every conceivable risk. 
RIKER: The risks on a ship this old and fragile are inconceivable,
Captain. 
PICARD: Ghosts, perhaps? Number One, have you never dreamed of climbing
inside the bottle? 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: The ship in the bottle. Model air ships. I used to build them
when I was a child. My God, I bet I had a Promellian battle cruiser
too.
