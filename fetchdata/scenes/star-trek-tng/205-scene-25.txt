TROI RO OBRIEN KEIKO WORF

[Bridge]

O'BRIEN: Sir, the field strength is stabilising.
Eighteen percent, twenty, twenty five. 
RO: I guess they got our message. I was wrong, Counsellor. 
TROI: You could have easily been right.

[Corridor]

(a turbolift door opens, and Picard hauls himself
onto the deck like a seal hauling itself onto land, followed by the
children. They sit panting)

[Ten Forward]

WORF: Congratulations. You are fully dilated to ten
centimetres. You may now give birth. 
KEIKO: That's what I've been doing. 
WORF: Bearing down is the next stage. It should start at full dilation.
Why has it not begun? 
KEIKO: I don't know. I don't think it's up to me. It happens when it
happens. 
WORF: The computer simulation was not like this. That delivery was very
orderly. 
KEIKO: Well, I'm sorry! 
WORF: Did you feel an uncontrollable urge to push? 
(screams with a nod) 
WORF: Good. You are bearing down. Now you must push with each
contraction and I must urge you gently but firmly to push harder. Push,
Keiko. Push hard. Push, Keiko. Push. Push. 
KEIKO: I am pushing! 
WORF: The baby is emerging head first. One more contraction. 
KEIKO: Okay. 
WORF: That's good. Push. Push. Hard. I have the baby. I will smack the
child to induce breathing. 
(waaa!) 
WORF: Now I will cut the umbilical cord. Blanket. I believe she looks
like Chief O'Brien. 
(he hands the baby to Keiko) 
KEIKO: Hello. You were wonderful, Worf. I couldn't have done it without
you. Hello.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are en route to
Starbase sixty seven, to undergo repairs. Life aboard the Enterprise is
slowly returning to normal.
