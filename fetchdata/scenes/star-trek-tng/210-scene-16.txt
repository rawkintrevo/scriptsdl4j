WORF: Computer, what programme is being run? 
COMPUTER: Calisthenics programme of Lieutenant Worf. Difficulty level,
Novice.

[Holodeck]

(Alexander is on the defensive for most of the time
until he gets a lucky swing) 
WORF: Computer, freeze programme. 
ALEXANDER: Did you see it, Father? I won. 
WORF: Yes, I saw. Why are you here? 
ALEXANDER: I'm training. 
WORF: But you did not ask permission to take my bat'leth, or permission
to use the holodeck. 
ALEXANDER: You said you wanted me to be a warrior. 
WORF: I also said I wanted you to obey your teachers and keep your
promise to me. Ms. Kyle has told me about your behaviour. About your
lies. 
ALEXANDER: I have not lied! 
WORF: Alexander, do not continue to 
ALEXANDER: She's lying! She hates me, that's why she makes up stories
about me! 
WORF: I will not listen to more lies. Return to our quarters. 
ALEXANDER: You said we could go see the gilvos again. 
WORF: Not now. Not after you have broken your word. 
ALEXANDER: You promised. You said that we could. 
WORF: Enough! It is now clear to me that I have failed in my duties as
your father. You have no understanding about what it means to be
Klingon. I will arrange for you to attend a Klingon school. There you
will learn the lessons I have failed to teach you. 
ALEXANDER: No! I won't go! 
WORF: Would you further dishonour our family with your disobedience? 
ALEXANDER: No, sir. 
WORF: You will go to our quarters and remain there until I return.

[Bridge]

(at the aft stations) 
RIKER: Riker to Engineering. What's your estimate on the engines,
Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I need another hour, Commander. I still have to replace
three power couplings. 
RIKER: Understood. 
DATA: Sir, sensors are coming back online. 
RIKER: Good. Begin a sensor sweep for the soliton wave. 
DATA: Aye, sir. The wave is continuing on course for the Lemma Two
colony. It is bearing zero two zero, mark three two nine. 
RIKER: Open a channel back here to Doctor Ja'Dar. 
DATA: Sir, the wave has increased in velocity to warp four point one. 
RIKER: Doctor, we've located the soliton wave. It's still on a course
for Lemma Two. However its velocity has increased to warp four point
one. 
JA'DAR [on monitor]: Have you checked the frequency resonance of the
subspace 
DATA: Sir, the energy level of the wave has increased by a factor of
twelve. At this rate, it will have increased by a factor of two hundred
by the time it reaches Lemma Two. 
RIKER: Will they still be able to dissipate the wave? 
JA'DAR [on monitor]: Commander, at that energy level, the wave will not
only destroy the colony, it'll take most of the planet with it.
