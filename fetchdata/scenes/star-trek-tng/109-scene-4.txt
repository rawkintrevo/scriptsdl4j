[Outside the Council Chambers]

(A low rise building with formal fountains in front
of it) 
RIVAN: Good health! I thought you might be out of breath. 
RIKER: We may surprise you in a lot of ways. 
LIATOR: Children, we've brought you a new friend!
BOY: Well, hello. Join us. 
GIRL: Yes, please. 
(Wesley runs off with the two boys and girl) 
RIVAN: And now it's time for you to meet some new friends. 
[Council Chambers]

(Musicians are playing gentle tunes, some couples
are dancing, others strolling with glasses of drink. One man is getting
a massage) 
RIVAN: Everyone! We've brought the visitors! 
LIATOR: Please enjoy what we have! 
(And the team are lead away to - whatever)

DATA: I've traced it through our sensor channel,
sir It is not a glitch or any other form of error or malfunction. 
LAFORGE: Confirmed by my readings, Captain. It's a shadow something. 
DATA: Exactly. As if it were neither in or out of our dimension. 
PICARD: What is, Commander? 
DATA: Whatever is sitting out there without triggering our alarm
relays, sir. 
PICARD: Centre main viewer on that area. I see nothing, Commander. 
DATA: Enterprise to object off our starboard bow. Request that you
identify yourself. 
(And something appears) 
LAFORGE: Shields and deflectors up full, sir. Main phaser banks ready. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. Any reply? 
DATA: It was something unintelligible, Captain. Now running it through
language and logic circuits. 
PICARD: Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Sir. 
PICARD: Have a real look. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
OFFICER: (At Tasha's station) Sir, my sensors read it. Well, it's half
there. It does look as if it were partly transparent. 
PICARD: Data, what the hell is it?
