PICARD RIKER WESLEY LAFORGE REGINOD

[Shuttlecraft]

PICARD: Van Doren's technique has been perfected to
two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortality
rate. Two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Those are pretty good odds. 
PICARD: Just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innards
becoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. 
WESLEY: Of course not, sir. Why didn't you just have Doctor Pulaski
perform the operation? I'm sure you could've trusted her to keep it
quiet. 
PICARD: Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shall
we?

LAFORGE: The power needs to be rerouted through
this venturi chamber before it can be channelled to the engine's coils.

REGINOD: It is broken. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but not for long. See, we are going to reconfigure these
separators, here and over here. 
RIKER [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker. Come in. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. Go ahead.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Are you all right? 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Sure. Why do you ask? 
RIKER: Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence from
the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: I don't think there's anything to worry about.

RIKER: Understood. As soon as you complete the repairs, I want you back
here. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir, I should be done here momentarily.
