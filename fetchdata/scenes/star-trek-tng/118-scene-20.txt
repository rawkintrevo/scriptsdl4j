[Music Unit]

(Melian is showing Katie how to play his electronic
instrument) 
MELIAN: Now, hold it a little bit more firmly. That's it. Perfect. Now
think. No, think's not right. Feel the notes inside your head. 
(She closes her eyes, and the machine lights up with a loud chord. She
drops it)
KATIE: I'm sorry. Did I break it? 
MELIAN: No, it's all right. You can't break this. 
KATIE: It did exactly what I thought. I mean, felt. 
MELIAN: Yes, it's a direct expression of the music within. Now we just
have to teach you to structure that feeling. Try it again. 
(She produces a melancholy little tune) 
MELIAN: That was beautiful. Now, play something happier. 
KATIE: That's not the way I feel. I don't want to do this any more.

[Artist's Unit]

ACCOLAN: You see, Harry, I told you you were going
to be an artist. 
HARRY: Are you sure? Did I really do this? 
ACCOLAN: Oh, yes. Your talent has always been there. The sculpting tool
is just helping you develop it. It's what you were meant to do. 
HARRY: You mean I don't have to take calculus anymore? 
ACCOLAN: You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. What's
calculus? 
HARRY: Nothing important. Can I do some more?

PICARD: Captain's log, supplemental. It has been
three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact
with Radue since then.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Radue, this is Picard. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Welcome back, Captain. What have you decided? 
PICARD: That there is room for discussion, Radue. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: We will bring you down when we are ready. 
PICARD: Data, find a way to defeat that shield. 
DATA: That may be impossible, sir. 
PICARD: Things are only impossible until they're not. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Crusher enters.) 
CRUSHER: Captain. Here's what I've learned so far. Duana is dying. I
have no reason to believe the rest of the Aldeans are any healthier.
They're suffering from some kind of chromosomal damage. It could be
genetic or environmental. 
PICARD: And is that why they can't conceive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. It also explains their lack of appetite, extreme pallor
and sensitivity to light. 
PICARD: An entire civilisation that's terminally ill. Is it reversible?

CRUSHER: I won't know until I find the cause. And you don't need to
tell me time is running out. 
PICARD: Good work, Doctor.
