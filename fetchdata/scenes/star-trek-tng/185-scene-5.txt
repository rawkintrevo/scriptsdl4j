TECHNICIAN TPEL OBRIEN DATA LAFORGE

[Ten Forward]

DATA [OC]: My friend Chief O'Brien often says that
above all else, he wants to make Keiko happy. Since cancelling the
wedding will make her happy, I must conclude the Chief will be pleased
at her decision. 
DATA: I have good news. 
O'BRIEN: Oh? 
DATA: Keiko has made a decision designed to increase her happiness. She
has cancelled the wedding. 
O'BRIEN: She what? Cancelled the wedding? Today? Without even a word?
Of all the childish, selfish, irresponsible things to do! 
(O'Brien storms out) 
LAFORGE: Next time, maybe I should break the good news. 
DATA [OC]: Commander Maddox, it would appear that my programme designed
to predict the emotional responses needs adjustment.

Second Officers personal log, supplemental. This is
the one thousand five hundred fiftieth day since the Enterprise was
commissioned.
Besides the arrival of Ambassador T'Pel, other events occurring today
include four birthdays, two personnel transfers, a celebration of the
Hindu Festival of Lights, two chess tournaments, one secondary school
play, and four promotions. Overall, an ordinary day.

[Transporter room]

TECHNICIAN: The Zhukov is ready for transport, sir.

DATA: Energise. 
DATA: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador. 
T'PEL: I would meet with your Captain.

[Turbolift]

DATA [OC]: Sine I am not affected by emotional
considerations, I am closer to being Vulcan than human. However, while
their devotion to logic does have a certain appeal, I find their stark
philosophy to be somewhat limited.
