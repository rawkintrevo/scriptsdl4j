WESLEY TROI CRUSHER

[Crusher's office]

WESLEY: Hi Mom. I got a message you wanted to see
me? 
CRUSHER: I thought you were going to be at the concert last night. 
WESLEY: I said I may be going. Suzanne wanted to go to the arboretum. 
CRUSHER: Captain Picard asked me where you were. I don't like making
excuses for you. 
WESLEY: Excuses? Come on, Mom. It wasn't an official function. 
CRUSHER: Listen, young man. You have responsibilities and I want you to
live up to them. 
WESLEY: Don't you think you're overreacting a little? 
CRUSHER: Don't talk back to me! 
WESLEY: Okay, I won't. 
CRUSHER: Where do you think you're going? 
WESLEY: Away from you. 
(Beverly slaps Wesley's cheek) 
[Troi's office]

CRUSHER: And then I just slapped him. Really hard.
I slapped Wesley. 
TROI: Do you know why you did it? 
CRUSHER: I've never hit my son in his life. 
TROI: Beverly, this is important. What were you thinking when you hit
Wes? 
CRUSHER: I wasn't thinking about anything. I was just angry. 
TROI: And Wesley didn't provoke you in any way? It wasn't anything he
said, or anything he did? 
CRUSHER: No, that's just it. It was a sudden burst of anger. I still
can't believe I did it. 
TROI: I don't know why you did it either, but I can tell you that I've
heard the same kind of story from ten different people over the last
two days.
