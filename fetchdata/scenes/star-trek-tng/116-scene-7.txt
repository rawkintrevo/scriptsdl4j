WESLEY: Can I ask you a question about the Bynars? 
GUEST0: Why not just ask them? 
WESLEY: What is that high-speed sound you make? 
ZERO ONE: That is our 
ONE ZERO: primary language. 
WESLEY: How can you process information at that speed? 
ZERO ONE: We store the information 
ONE ZERO: with these buffers. 
(on their belts) 
ZERO ONE: We receive information 
ONE ZERO: all the time 
ZERO ONE: and save it 
ONE ZERO: until we need it. 
WESLEY: How did you happen to develop this ability? 
ONE ZERO: It happened over 
ZERO ONE: a long period of time. 
WESLEY: To have a society so intermixed on computers has tremendous
advantages. 
ONE ZERO: And a few 
ZERO ONE: disadvantages. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Everything under control, Ensign Crusher? 
WESLEY: Fine, Captain. I was just trying to find something about the
Bynars. 
PICARD: Where's Commander Riker? 
WESLEY: He's in holodeck four. Shall I call him for you, sir? 
PICARD: No, I'll go down there myself. Keep me apprised. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.

(Riker joins the band with his trombone, and
serenades Minuet with 'the nearness of you) 
GUEST8: Hey, man, the chick digs you. 
RIKER: What makes you say that? 
GUEST8: Hey, look at her. 
RIKER: Maybe it's my music. 
GUEST7: Yeah, well, about that. Don't give up your day job. 
RIKER: Too real. 
GUEST8: You got that straight, Slim. Too real is too right. 
RIKER: Thanks for letting me sit in. 
GUEST7: Ain't nothin' to it. 
RIKER: I'm going to have to leave for a while to see to my duties. 
GUEST6: Your work's very important to you. 
RIKER: It is me. It's what I am. 
GUEST6: Can we dance once before you leave? 
RIKER: Sure, why not. (She snuggles in close) How did you learn to
dance so well? 
GUEST6: From following you. I can anticipate your lead. So, tell me
about your work. What is it about it that consumes and
enthralls you? 
RIKER: Interesting choice of words. That's exactly what it does. 
GUEST6: You're very fortunate. 
RIKER: I know that. 
GUEST6: To be exactly where you want to be. And it's great that you
realise it. 
RIKER: I'd be a fool not to realise how lucky I am to be on this ship
serving with these people. It's like a dream come true. Just like this.

GUEST6: A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what I am? 
RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, your
touch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think
seem so real. 
GUEST6: Thank you. 
RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? 
GUEST6: As real as you need me to be. 
(They kiss for a long time, then the holodeck doors open and) 
PICARD: Astounding. 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Oh, I'm sorry, Number One. I didn't mean to interrupt. 
RIKER: No, it's all right. Come on in. 
PICARD: You picked a wonderful locale. This is something I might have
chosen myself. 
GUEST6: Aren't you going to introduce me? 
RIKER: Captain Picard, this is Minuet. Minuet, Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

GUEST6: Enchantee. Comme c'est merveilleux de vous voir ici. 
PICARD: Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne? 
GUEST6: Au fond, c'est vrai, nous sommes tous Parisiens. 
PICARD: Oui, au fond, nous sommes tous Parisiens. The spirit of that
city can always enchant my soul. 
GUEST6: I have been hoping to meet you. 
PICARD: Oh. Have I been the subject of conversation? 
GUEST6: Indirectly. Come, join us, Jean-Luc. A glass of wine? 
PICARD: Thank you. 
GUEST6: Will was saying how much he enjoys this assignment. It's a
credit to you. For a ship and crew to function well it always starts
with the Captain. You set the tone. 
PICARD: At the moment, it's you who are setting the tone. The
sophistication of this programming is remarkable. 
GUEST6: In what way? 
PICARD: The holodeck has been able to give us woodlands and ski slopes,
figures that fight and fictional characters with which we can interact,
but you, you're very different. You adapt. You spoke to me in French. 
GUEST6: It was very simple. When I heard your name, I merely accessed
the foreign language bank. 
PICARD: That's very impressive. 
GUEST6: Oui, mon chou.
