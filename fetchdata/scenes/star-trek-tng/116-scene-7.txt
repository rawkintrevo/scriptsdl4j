[Bridge]

(There are four Bynars at a rear computer station.
Wesley is watching them as Riker and Picard enter) 
PICARD: I'll be in my ready room. And Number One, good work. 
RIKER: I thought there were only going to be two of you. 
ONE ZERO: Because of the limited time allotted us 
ZERO ONE: We need others 
RIKER: Is there a problem? 
ZERO ONE: No. 
ONE ZERO: No. No problem. 
RIKER: Then why are you acting so excited? 
ZERO ONE: Because we have to 
ONE ZERO: The stacking 
ZERO ONE: To reconfigure the computer 
ONE ZERO: To communicate with itself 
ZERO ONE: More efficiently 
ONE ZERO: And at higher speeds. 
(They turn back to their work) 
WESLEY: You act like you don't believe them. 
RIKER: I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's probably nothing. 
WESLEY: Perhaps it's just how another species behaves. 
RIKER: Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You've got the Bridge. Keep
your eye on them. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.

[Corridor]

(Tasha, Worf and two others are wearing vivid blue
catsuits with knee and elbow pads) 
TASHA: We've been challenged to a friendly game of Parrises Squares by
some of the maintenance personnel. Want to join us on the starbase? 
RIKER: You've already got all the players you need. 
TASHA: We can switch off. 
RIKER: No, you know if you do that in Parrises Squares you lose the
rhythm of the game. 
TASHA: I can't talk you into coming with us? 
RIKER: No. But win, all right? The pride of the Enterprise goes with
you. 
WORF: Rest assured, Commander, we will be victorious. At whatever the
cost. 
RIKER: Worf, it's just a game. A little friendly competition, You work
up a sweat, you have a few laughs, and you make new friends. 
WORF: If winning is not important, then, Commander, why keep score? 
TASHA: I think he's pulling your leg. Believe it or not, Worf is
developing a sense of humour. 
RIKER: I hope so, for their sake. 
(The team go down another corridor, then the lights go out. Riker
activates panel 40271)) 
RIKER: Computer. There's a power reduction in section L-Ninety Four.
Explain. 
COMPUTER: Unoccupied sections are being closed down in order to clear
space in the main computer banks. It is necessary to facilitate the
system upgrade. Full power can be restored if needed.

[Observation Lounge]

(Data is painting an image on glass) 
LAFORGE: Well, what do you think? 
RIKER: Tell me what it's supposed to be, then I'll give you my opinion.

DATA: It is an attempt at pure creativity. 
LAFORGE: What we're investigating is, can Data be creative? 
DATA: And this is my attempt, with guidance from Geordi. 
LAFORGE: I suggested the zylo eggs. 
RIKER: Is that what those are? 
RIKER: Keep notes. This project might turn out to be of interest to
scholars in the future. 
LAFORGE: Really? 
RIKER: Well of course. Think about it. A blind man teaching an android
how to paint? That's got to be worth a couple of pages in somebody's
book.
