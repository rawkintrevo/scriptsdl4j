[Troi's quarters]

RIKER: Recognise anything? 
TROI: It's like it belongs to someone else. Nothing feels right. This
room, this ship, most of all this war we're fighting. 
RIKER: I don't imagine war ever feels right. 
TROI: I suppose that's true. 
RIKER: What is it? 
TROI: That same feeling. You seem familiar. You're the only thing that
does. 
RIKER: Can you remember anything specific about us? 
TROI: I don't know. It's more like remembering an emotion. Feelings
that you're somehow associated with. 
RIKER: I hope they're good feelings. 
TROI: Yes, they are. This entire situation is a little unnerving. 
RIKER: It's been a long day. We've all been through a lot. 
TROI: We certainly have. 
(she gives him a peck on the cheek) 
RIKER: I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.

[Riker's quarters]

(someone is in casual clothes, reading a book) 
RO: Hi. 
RIKER: I know I didn't get the wrong room. 
RO: I just didn't like the way my quarters were decorated. Besides, I
have this funny feeling that maybe I spend most of my off hours here. 
RIKER: Really? 
RO: For all we know, you and I could be married. 
RIKER: For all we know, you and I could hate each other. 
RO: Sort of exciting, isn't it? We just don't know. 
RIKER: We might regret this. 
RO: Regret what? Aren't you being a little presumptuous? Like I said, I
just didn't like the way my quarters were decorated. 
RIKER: Maybe we should switch quarters. 
RO: Maybe we should stay right here and see what happens. 
RIKER: What if I snore in my sleep? 
RO: What makes you think you're going to get any sleep?

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, we have crossed the Lysian border. 
PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. Go to three quarters impulse. 
RO: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, maintain a continuous sensor sweep. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
MACDUFF: How long till we reach their central command? 
DATA: At our current speed, approximately thirty seven hours. 
WORF: Captain, I am picking up a vessel directly ahead. 
PICARD: Can you identify it, Mister Data? 
DATA: The ship matches the Starfleet description of a Lysian destroyer.
A short range attack vessel with disruptor style weapons, and a
standard crew of fifty three. 
WORF: Within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(it's just like the first ship they encountered) 
WORF: The destroyer is increasing its speed. They are moving to
intercept. 
PICARD: Evasive manoeuvre sequence delta. 
RO: Yes, sir. 
WORF: They are matching our manoeuvres. 
MACDUFF: Activating phaser arrays. Ready to fire, sir. 
PICARD: Stand by. 
MACDUFF: Captain, our orders were to destroy all Lysian warships. 
PICARD: I'm aware of that, Commander. Tactical analysis, Mister Data. 
DATA: The destroyer has minimal shields. Their disruptor capacity
appears to be only two point one megajoules. 
RIKER: They're no match for the Enterprise. 
DATA: Captain, the destroyer is hailing us. 
PICARD: Open a channel. 
MACDUFF: No! Their new weapon. Whatever it was that erased out our
computers and our memories, maybe this is how they do it, over
communication channels. 
DATA: It is conceivable, sir. 
TROI: It's also possible that they just want to talk to us. I think we
should respond. 
WORF: Captain, the ship is hailing us again. 
MACDUFF: If you're wrong, it could mean our destruction. We can't take
the risk, Captain. 
DATA: The Lysians have stopped transmitting, Captain. They are powering
up their disruptors. They have locked onto us, sir. 
RIKER: Full shields. 
WORF: Shields up. 
MACDUFF: Captain? 
PICARD: Return fire. 
(KaBOOM) 
WORF: The ship has been destroyed. 
PICARD: Maintain this course, Ensign. Three quarters impulse. 
RO: Yes, sir. 
MACDUFF: Well done, Captain.

[Observation lounge]

WORF: The Lysian Central Command would have
received any transmission from the destroyer by now. 
MACDUFF: They're going to be on alert. 
RO: I recommend a randomly vectored approach to our target. It would be
our best chance of avoiding sort of any pursuit. 
PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, the success of this mission would be far more
likely if we could get our memories back. Is there anything you can do?

CRUSHER: I found several cases resembling our condition in the medical
index. The causes are different, but the cure is similar in each case. 
RIKER: Could the same treatment work for us? 
CRUSHER: That's my hope. It involves increasing the activity of the
medial temporal region of the brain, using short-term memory synapses
to retrieve long-term memory. 
PICARD: When can you start? 
CRUSHER: As soon as our medical files become available. It would be
dangerous to attempt treatment without them. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Data and I ran into some trouble accessing the medical file
areas in the computer, but with a little time I'm pretty sure we'll be
able to get there. Three hours, maximum. 
PICARD: Proceed.
