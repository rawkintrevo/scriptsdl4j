BARCLAY [OC]: Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Reg? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I thought you would be in your quarters. 
LAFORGE: No, I'm just catching up on some work, you know? That level
three diagnostic we talked about. How're you doing? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I wish I could convey to you what it's like for me now.
What I've become. 
LAFORGE: Yeah? Try. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can conceive almost infinite possibilities, and can
fully explore each of them in a nanosecond. I perceive the universe as
a single equation, and it is so simple, I understand. 
LAFORGE: You understand? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Everything. 
LAFORGE: Well, do you understand how this happened to you? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I believe it is a gift. That I have been chosen to
fulfill a great purpose. 
LAFORGE: Ah ha. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Do you suppose all of this has changed the way people
think about me? 
LAFORGE: To tell you the truth, Reg, we don't know what to think. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I've been concerned about that, but soon everyone will
understand what I can do for humanity. 
LAFORGE: What do you mean? 
[Holodeck]

BARCLAY [OC]: We have always perceived the maximum
speed of the Enterprise as a function of warp, but I know now there are
no limits. We will explore new worlds that we could never before have
reached in our lifetime.

BARCLAY [OC]: I will take us to them.

WORF: Captain, I am picking up subspace distortion.

PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: This disturbance is the result of a highly charged graviton field
emanating from our warp nacelles. It is creating a severe bias in the
subspace continuum. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, are you responsible for this graviton field
disturbance? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, sir, I'm altering subspace in a way that's never
been conceived of before. I'm fairly certain it will allow us to travel
half-way across the galaxy in a matter of only 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, I want you to stop this experiment for now. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Captain, if you'd only allow me to show 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, this is a direct order. Discontinue whatever it
is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I really would rather not, sir. I'm positive that you'll
be pleased with the result once I've finished showing 
WORF: Audio is disconnected. We may speak freely. 
RIKER: How soon before the ODN process is in place? 
DATA: I have been monitoring Geordi's progress. It will be operational
in seventeen minutes. 
TROI: Captain, let me go to the holodeck and try and talk to him. 
WORF: Sir, the subspace distortion continues to increase. 
[Holodeck]

BARCLAY [OC]: Hello, Deanna. 
TROI: Reg. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry that we can't take that walk in the Arboretum. 
TROI: So am I. Reg, you've frightened all of us. I'm sure that wasn't
your intent. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Young children are sometimes frightened of the world.
That doesn't mean that their parents should let them stay in their
cribs. 
TROI: Are we children to you now? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can see so much more than you are capable of. You
should trust that. Deanna, I've always wanted to earn your respect. 
TROI: You've got it. From all of us. We don't need any more convincing.
Please, obey the Captain's orders. Stop whatever it is you're doing. 
BARCLAY [OC]: You must trust me. 
TROI: How can we trust an officer who doesn't follow orders? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Trust me. 
TROI: The Captain will do everything in his power to stop you. 
(and the lasers speed up even more)
