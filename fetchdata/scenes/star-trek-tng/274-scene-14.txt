RHODES [OC] PICARD BOK CRUSHER
worthless replicator apology level propose choice better sorry playing

[Ready room]

(Picard leaves his desk and goes to the replicator)

PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. 
(Bok is in his chair) 
BOK: If you want me to stay and talk, you'd better not call for
security this time. How do you like your boy, Captain? Is he everything
you'd always hoped for? 
PICARD: It's a risky game you're playing, coming here. Next time we'll
be ready for you. Why don't we settle this now? 
BOK: Oh, and how do you propose to do that, Picard? You murdered my
son. 
PICARD: It was self-defence. He fired on my ship. 
BOK: You were in Ferengi space! 
PICARD: I didn't know that. If he'd told me I would have withdrawn. I'm
sorry, but there's nothing I can do to bring him back. 
BOK: How touching. Your apology is worthless to me. I demand that you
repay me for my loss. 
PICARD: You cannot put a price on a life. 
BOK: Oh, but you can, Picard. You can pay me with your son's life. 
PICARD: No. 
BOK: You don't have any choice. I insist on being paid. 
(Bok beams out)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: That should do it. Let's run a level three
bioscan just to be sure. 
RHODES [OC]: Rhodes to Sickbay, Medical emergency, deck nine, section
four. 
CRUSHER: Let's go.
