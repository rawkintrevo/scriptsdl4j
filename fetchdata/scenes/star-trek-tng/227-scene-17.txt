ALIEN PICARD TROI LAFORGE CLEMENS
misjudged sadly fourth energy watch crew allow buffering disappears

[Science lab]

(the one where Lal was born and Picard
de-Borgified) 
TROI: Any luck? 
LAFORGE: Not so far. His activating units won't initialise. I thought
they would have been protected by his buffering
programme, but I guess five hundred years is just too long a wait. 
CLEMENS: My watch. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. It was found in the cavern where Data's head was. I
guess after five hundred years, that's not likely to work either. 
CLEMENS: Mister Data, I fear I sadly misjudged you. As I have misjudged
many things.

[Cavern]

(the female alien is waking up, and flickering
between human and alien) 
PICARD: Can you communicate? 
ALIEN: Yes. 
PICARD: You're injured. 
ALIEN: Why have you interfered with us? 
PICARD: You hunt us. You kill us. We cannot allow that. 
ALIEN: We need your energy. 
PICARD: Perhaps we can find a substitute. 
ALIEN: No. There is none. We must continue. 
PICARD: We know how you move back and forth through time. My crew have
returned to the twenty fourth century to destroy your transport site on
Devidia Two. 
ALIEN: Destroy it? Your weapons will only amplify the time distortion.
You will annihilate your own world. 
(and she disappears)
