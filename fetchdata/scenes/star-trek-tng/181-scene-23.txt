[Observation lounge]

GOWRON: jIH DoQ batlh! 
PICARD: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We are
ready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess while
I review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about the
explosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuing
your investigations? 
GOWRON: The investigations are complete. They revealed nothing of any
importance. 
PICARD: Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up some
startling results. (into
comm.) Will you join us, Lieutenant? 
(Worf enters) 
DURAS: What is this? 
GOWRON: He has no place here, Picard! 
DURAS: I will not sit at the same table with that! 
PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be
relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my Chief
Security Officer. His presence is required. 
DURAS: We will not proceed. 
PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option.
Proceed, Mister Worf. 
WORF: What did your investigations reveal about the explosion? 
DURAS: It was a bomb. 
WORF: And was your analysis just as insightful? 
GOWRON: It was a common explosive. 
WORF: What type? 
GOWRON: Triceron. 
WORF: What about the detonator? 
DURAS: This is pointless! The findings were inconclusive. 
WORF: Fortunately, our investigation was more thorough. The bomb used a
molecular-decay detonator. 
GOWRON: What? 
PICARD: A Romulan device. 
DURAS: I will return to my ship to confirm these conclusions myself. 
GOWRON: As will I. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of our
findings to both vessels and to the High Council. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: That will be all.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Computer, interlock with the Klingon
Imperial Information Net. 
COMPUTER: Interlock established. 
K'EHLEYR: Federation Ambassador K'Ehleyr requesting diplomatic access
to High Council record. Security code pah doQ cha! 
COMPUTER: Proceed. 
K'EHLEYR: Computer, display summary of the most recent High Council
inquiry regarding Khitomer massacre. 
COMPUTER: Access denied. Restricted materials, du ko cha clearance
only. 
K'EHLEYR: By whose order? 
COMPUTER: Council member Duras. 
K'EHLEYR: Access biographical files. Subject name, Councillor Duras.

[Duras' quarters]

DURAS: Advise my counsellors on the Vorn to
convene. There is much to discuss. 
KLINGON: Look. 
DURAS: What is this? 
KLINGON: Priority message to you from the home planet. It seems
Ambassador K'Ehleyr is looking into things she should not be. 
DURAS: Distract the guard for me. 
KLINGON: Yes, sir. 
(And simply walks out of the room into the corridor) 
GUARD: Sir. Excuse me, sir. You cannot leave your quarters without an
escort. 
(and Duras slips out in the other direction)

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Come. 
DURAS: I have been informed of your attempt to access restricted
Council records. 
K'EHLEYR: I've been investigating what happened at Khitomer. Not at all
an easy task, considering that most of the records are sealed. 
DURAS: Worf's father was a traitor. 
K'EHLEYR: No, the evidence was altered to make it appear that way. I
found it interesting to read that your father was also at Khitomer and
you are the one who sealed the records. 
DURAS: You would dare to insult my father's name? 
K'EHLEYR: Don't play the wounded Klingon for me, Duras. You don't do it
very well. What happened in that Council Chamber? How did you get Worf
to take the blame for you? 
DURAS: Do not pursue this matter further. 
K'EHLEYR: The son betrays his people to the Romulans just as his father
did, Duras?
