PICARD TROI RIKER WORF

[Transporter room]

(O'Brien is transporter chief today) 
WORF: Coordinates have been input, sir. 
TROI: Have your sensors indicated any problem down there,
Lieutenant?
WORF: None. 
TROI: But you're feeling a certain confusion about this mission. 
WORF: No. 
TROI: Yes. I've never known you to have such strong emotions, except
when you're expecting to do battle. 
WORF: I am not expecting battle. 
RIKER: Then what is bothering you? 
WORF: Riva. 
PICARD: Ah. Riva negotiated several treaties between the Klingons and
the Federation.
WORF: Before him, there was no Klingon word for peacemaker. 
RIKER: Then I can understand why you're feeling uneasy. 
PICARD: Now look, this is a simple ceremonial greeting, nothing more.
All right? 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(Picard, Troi and Worf get on the transporter pads) 
PICARD: Energise.

[Room]

(They arrive in a marbled room, and walk forward to
an area with a slightly raised
dais in front of a stained glass window. There is no one there.)

[Bridge]

RIKER: Captain, this is the Enterprise. 
[Room]

PICARD: We've arrived safely, Number One, but so
far we've been ignored. I'll keep you informed.
