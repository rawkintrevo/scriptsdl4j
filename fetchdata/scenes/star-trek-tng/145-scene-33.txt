[Sickbay]

(A round fish-eye flicks open) 
PULASKI: Pulaski to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
PULASKI: The Antedeans are coming around. They are currently in the
early stages of post hibernation.

[Bridge]

RIKER: How long until they're fully conscious? 
PULASKI [OC]: I'd guess it to be a matter of hours now. 
RIKER: Very well, I'll inform the Captain. If you'll excuse me, ma'am. 
LWAXANA: You're going to see the Captain? But I thought he was tied up
on ship's business. 
RIKER: In a manner of speaking he is. I'm not going to be disturbing
him, I'll just give him the message. 
LWAXANA: Excellent timing. Then you may also inform him about us. 
RIKER: Us? 
LWAXANA: You don't mind if I let our ship's crew know first, do you,
William? Friends. Dear friends. You are all invited to a prestigious
occasion on the planet Pacifica. 
TROI: No. 
LWAXANA: There, on the shores of the Western Sea, in a traditional
Betazoid ceremony, your Commander Riker and I will be joined in the
union of matrimony. 
WESLEY: Married? 
LWAXANA: Until death us do part. 
RIKER: Mrs. Troi, I don't know how to tell you this. 
LWAXANA: I know how you feel, dear. You're overwhelmed with excitement.
Believe me, I understand. We'll talk about the details later. Right
now, there are preparations to be made. 
(Lwaxana and Homn leave) 
TROI: Why did you stop me? Someone needs to set her straight! 
RIKER: I think I'll leave that to the Captain. 
TROI: Coward. 
DATA: Commander. Are you planning on going into the holodeck? 
RIKER: I thought I might. Would you like to join me? 
DATA: Could you postpone our departure for just five minutes, sir? 
RIKER: No problem.

[Rex's Bar]

PICARD: You said you had responsibilities. What
exactly did you mean? 
MADELINE: You know about my mother's cousin, the girl from San Antonio
I told you about? 
(There's a shadow at the door) 
MADELINE: Jimmy. 
(Enter Data in costume, and Riker in uniform) 
REX: I'm as jumpy as Haircut Lapinski trying to land on a fraction. 
RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Captain. 
REX: Captain? 
PICARD: Call me Dix. 
RIKER: Sorry to bother you, Dix, but our two passengers have awakened. 
PICARD: Then it's time for me to go. 
MADELINE: What about Jimmy Cuzzo? You can't leave Rex to face him
alone. 
PICARD: I'll be back before Jimmy Cuzzo arrives. I guarantee it will be
taken care of. Just relax. 
REX: Your friends've got time for one drink, haven't they, Dix? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, of course. One more round. These are my associates.
This is Nails, from Chicago. And this is 
DATA: Carlos. 
PICARD: From South America. This is Madeline, my secretary, and I want
you to meet Rex. You know, I don't think I ever heard your last name? 
REX: Hm. Don't think I have one. Just Rex, that's all. So, fellas, tell
me your troubles. 
RIKER: Well, troubles. We've got some, Captain. It seems that a certain
woman, both wealthy and beautiful, now thinks that that she's going to
marry me. 
REX: She's got looks and bucks? Sounds like you've got yourself a heck
of a deal.

[Lwaxana's quarters]

LWAXANA: My fianc just has to see how I look in
this. Come along, Homn.
