RIKER LAFORGE JAMESON [OC] JAMESON PICARD KARNAS [on monitor] KARNAS [OC] DATA
city requested longer thirty schedule dead access going trouble

[Bridge]

DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: One moment, Mister Data. Admiral, this is Picard. May I know
the reason for this communication?

[Observation lounge]

JAMESON: Karnas must have tried to negotiate with
the terrorists before he was forced to call on me. I want all the
information he has access to. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: You said Karnas was a proud man, Admiral,
probably sensitive about his failure to deal with this situation. Is it
wise to press him on this? 
[Observation lounge]

JAMESON: I'm the negotiator, Picard. 
[Bridge]

JAMESON [OC]: Karnas will have to cooperate with me
and the terrorists, and damn his sensitivities. 
PICARD: Then I suggest a secured channel, Admiral. 
[Observation lounge]

JAMESON: A sensible precaution, Picard. Make it so.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Make it so. 
DATA: Aye, sir. Frequency open and secured.

[Observation lounge]

JAMESON: Karnas. 
KARNAS [OC]: What is it you want, Admiral? 
JAMESON: We're on a secured channel, Karnas. You can talk freely. Who's
behind this thing? You said dissidents. 
KARNAS [on monitor]: Yes, political opponents who feel the Federation
will disavow me as Governor if they stir up enough trouble on Mordan. 
JAMESON: Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor? 
KARNAS [on monitor]: They're dead, Jameson. A long time now. For a long
time I thought you were dead, too. 
JAMESON: I almost died a couple of times on missions, but I always made
it through somehow. 
KARNAS [on monitor]: Yes. Now you're coming back to Mordan to negotiate
for hostages again. It's almost as though the forty five years
in-between never happened. 
JAMESON: You've never forgiven me. 
KARNAS [on monitor]: Of course I have. It was years ago. 
JAMESON: There are no dissidents, are there? No terrorists. You have
the hostages. 
KARNAS [on monitor]: And if I have? You're coming to Mordan, Jameson,
and you're going to negotiate for their lives. And I'm going to ask a
very, very high price. 
JAMESON: What if I refuse? 
KARNAS [on monitor]: Then the hostages will die. You've seen how my
executioners work. They are still as efficient as they were, perhaps
even more skilled now. You'll come, even if you don't have much honour
left. 
[Bridge]

JAMESON: Conn, are we still on schedule to arrive
at Mordan in thirty eight hours? 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. We're at warp four. 
JAMESON: Picard, I want a jump to warp eight, so that we arrive ahead
of our announced ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance, and we can catch
him before he's ready. 
PICARD: Ready for exactly what, Admiral? 
JAMESON: I believe Karnas has the hostages, and there never were any
dissidents. 
PICARD: What has happened to bring you to that conclusion? That's quite
a big jump. 
JAMESON: I'm not at liberty to say, Picard, but negotiations are no
longer the answer. 
PICARD: Isn't the most important thing the hostage's lives? 
JAMESON: And you agree with that too, Riker? 
RIKER: I do, sir. 
JAMESON: Good. Because I plan to personally lead an away team on an
armed rescue mission to get them out of there. 
(Later, Jameson is in the Captain's chair, giving the orders) 
JAMESON: Commander Data, bring up the plans I requested on the
viewscreen, please. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
JAMESON: Most of Mordan's principal city was devastated during the war.
What was left consisted largely of a network of underground tunnels. A
rat's maze. When they rebuilt the city, they simply built over the
tunnels. 
DATA: I have it, sir. 
LAFORGE: Pardon me, sir, but where do these tunnels come into the
picture? 
JAMESON: This is where Karnas held his hostages before and where I
believe he has them now. 
PICARD: Wouldn't that be a little obvious, Admiral? 
JAMESON: Karnas is a dogged strategist, Picard, not a brilliant one. He
sticks to what works. He will kill the hostages if we do not get them
out of there. 
PICARD: Therefore you see this armed raid as the only option. 
JAMESON: You don't agree? 
PICARD: With respect, Admiral, I would point out no one else has heard
or considered Karnas's demands. The Federation might view them
differently if they knew what they were. 
JAMESON: Starfleet has given me command of the away team, Picard, and I
intend to use them as I see fit.
