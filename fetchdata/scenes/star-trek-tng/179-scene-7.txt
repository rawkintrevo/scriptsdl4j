RIKER: Course laid in for Durenia Four, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Mister Data? 
DATA: Sir, Starbase one three three has no record at all of a Doctor
Dalen Quaice. 
PICARD: You said he was stationed there for six years. 
DATA: Not according to their computer. I have also accessed Starfleet
records. There is no doctor currently serving in Starfleet named
Quaice. In fact, I can find no service record whatsoever. There are no
birth records with that name. I find no

CRUSHER: His name is Dalen Quaice. Q U A I C E. Whatever your records

Quaice. 
RIKER: You're not alone. 
CRUSHER: He was on board. I met him myself in Transporter room three.

RIKER: Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard?

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Doctor Quaice? Was he part of the regular
crew rotation? 
RIKER: No. He's a friend of Doctor Crusher's. 
O'BRIEN: When did he arrive? 
CRUSHER: Yesterday at sixteen hundred hours. 
O'BRIEN: That was my watch. I beamed this man onboard? 
CRUSHER: Yes. I was here to greet him. An elderly man, not in the best
of health. 
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry. I remember you were here for a short while, but you
were alone. 
CRUSHER: Was he invisible? Did I carry on a conversation with thin air?

O'BRIEN: No, Doctor. As I recall, you came in and you looked around for
a few moments. I asked you if I could help you with anything. All you
said was 'Thank you.' I said, 'My pleasure,' or something, and that was
the end of it. There was no one else here.
