PICARD [OC] SILVA LAFORGE DATA [OC] PICARD CRUSHER DATA
head accident reverse reduce accidentally warp crew talk abruptly

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I'm scanning for your ship. I'm not
getting anything. 
SILVA: We're still too far away. 
LAFORGE: No, not really. I should be picking something up by now. I'm
not finding anything. There's no warp funnel, no ship. There's nothing
there. 
(Silva is behind Geordi, moving her hands to the
side of his head. Red energy passes from her fingers to Geordi) 
[Laboratory]

PICARD: Doctor, report. 
CRUSHER: His neural synapses are overloading. He can't survive this. 
PICARD: Geordi, what's happening to you? 
LAFORGE: Reverse tractor beam.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

DATA [OC]: Reversing tractor beam. 
(Silva is thrown off and reveals herself as a flame before reverting to
the image of Geordi's mother again) 
LAFORGE: What are you? 
SILVA: You're killing us. We must go down. 
PICARD [OC]: Geordi?

[Laboratory]

PICARD: What's happening? Report. 
LAFORGE: You're, you're trapped? 
PICARD: Is there any way that we can disconnect him? 
CRUSHER: If we take him off too abruptly, he'll go into neural shock. 
LAFORGE: Caught on the ship? 
PICARD: Reduce the input gradually, and still get him out before it's
too late. 
LAFORGE: Are you saying that you killed the Raman's crew? 
DATA: Perhaps we could deceive his neural receptors. 
PICARD: Deceive them? 
DATA: By feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlier
experiences with the probe. 
CRUSHER: We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input
levels. 
DATA: We could then lower them in a controlled manner. 
LAFORGE: What do you want? 
PICARD: Like a decompression tank? Let's try it. 
LAFORGE: Then, it was an accident? Captain, I have to take the ship
into the lower atmosphere. 
PICARD: Explain. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: As I understand it, when the Raman got
close to the planet it accidentally picked up some lifeforms that live
in the lower atmosphere. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: Subspace beings of some kind. Intelligent.
When the ship went back into a higher orbit, the beings were trapped. 
PICARD: How do you know all this? 
LAFORGE: One of them can communicate with me. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: It must have read my thoughts through the
probe interface and took the form of my mother to try to talk me into
taking the ship closer to the surface. 
PICARD [OC]: Are these beings
