ARMUS PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Analysis, Mister Data. 
DATA: Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell you what it is, but I can tell
you what it is not. 
RIKER: Explain. 
DATA: There is no evidence of neural or circulatory systems. No
internal organs. Cellular structure unknown. It does not have any
proteins which are known to us. 
CRUSHER: It's narrower over here. We can get over it. 
RIKER: How is it moving, Data? 
DATA: I do not know, sir. It does not appear to have a skeletal
framework or musculature. 
RIKER: Then what's causing it to move? 
DATA: It appears to be following us, sir. 
RIKER: No sign of intelligence, no brain as we know it, yet evidence of
thought, Mister Data? 
DATA: Insufficient information, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Is it a life form, Data? 
DATA [OC]: Again, insufficient information, sir. 
PICARD: Theorise.

[Planet surface]

DATA: It is possible. 
(The oil slick ripples, and speaks) 
ARMUS: Very good, tin man. 

[Bridge]

PICARD: What is it, Number One? What are you
seeing? 
[Planet surface]

(As a vaguely humanoid shape rises wet and
glistening from the slick) 
RIKER: Trouble.

Captain's log, supplemental. While on a mission to
rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team has
encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different
forms, including one which resembles humanoid.
