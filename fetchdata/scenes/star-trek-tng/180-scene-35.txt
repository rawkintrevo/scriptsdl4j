RIKER ISHARA LAFORGE WORF HAYNE PICARD CRUSHER DATA

[Observation lounge]

HAYNE [on monitor]: Report. 
ISHARA: It's working.

Captain's log, stardate 44225.3. Doctor Crusher has
successfully removed Ishara's magnetic implant, enabling the young
woman to guide
our rescue attempt. Without my intending it, she has virtually become
an active member of the crew.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Cardiovascular functions normal.
Metabolism, immunity, all other vital signs excellent. How do you feel?

ISHARA: Better than I've ever felt. (to Data) Thanks for staying with
me. 
CRUSHER: You might want to keep this. It's been with you a long time. 
(Beverly hands her the implant, and leaves.) 
ISHARA: You keep it, Data, so you won't forget me. 
DATA: Have you reconsidered your decision to stay with us? 
ISHARA: No. Just in case something goes wrong down there.

[Corridor]

WORF: I understand you wish to join Starfleet. 
ISHARA: Some day. If I'm lucky. 
WORF: On that day, it is we who will be lucky.

[Transporter room]

(Worf and Ishara enter) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? 
RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Status, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Phasers in alignment and ready to fire. 
PICARD: How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function?

LAFORGE: One point six kilometres. 
PICARD: Fire phasers. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(The beam begins drilling into the planet surface) 
LAFORGE: One point three kilometres. One point four. One point five
kilometres. One point six kilometres. Deep enough for transport, sir. 
PICARD: Cease fire. Mister O'Brien, energise.

[Tunnel]

(The team beam in and move off slowly, weapons
drawn) 
ISHARA: This way. 
WORF: Caution is indicated. 
ISHARA: We're near the heart of the Alliance. Security is minimal here.
They aren't expecting anybody this far in. 
RIKER: Ishara? 
ISHARA: Follow me. 
WORF: Are you certain? 
ISHARA: No, I'm not. I'm trying to remember. I was here, but it was a
long time ago. There have been changes. It's through here. 
(a man is guarding a door) 
ISHARA: There. Your men are behind that door. 
(Riker, Worf and Data move forward. Riker shoots the guard, then he and
Worf phaser open the door)
