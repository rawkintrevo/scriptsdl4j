RIKER RICE TASHA PICARD TSU DATA

[Planet surface]

RIKER: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Commander, our communications are being monitored. 
RIKER: By whom? 
DATA: Since there is no intelligent life, the question is by what? 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, we heard that, Number One. We'll try and track it down
from here.

[Ruins]

TASHA: Tritanium. It's been melted. 
RIKER: What could do that? 
TASHA: I don't know. Whatever it was, it's beyond our technology. 
DATA: Over here. 
TASHA: Wow. 
(Data takes the moss from a big ray gun) 
RIKER: We've never even seen anything like this. 
TASHA: It's undamaged. 
RIKER: Maybe a demonstration model for some potential buyer. 
TASHA: Maybe. Let's spread out a little.

[Bridge]

T'SU: Commander Riker, this is Ensign T'Su. 
[Ruins]

T'SU [OC]: I'm monitoring a slight energy buildup
near your position. I am not able to pinpoint the source. 
RIKER: Give me a direction. 
[Bridge]

T'SU: East of your position, ten metres. I will
continue monitoring. 

[Jungle]

RIKER: I can't see anything through here. The
underbrush is too thick. 
RICE: Hello. Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Rice! Where did you come from? 
RICE: I was over there. 
RIKER: We were worried about you. I should have known you'd pop up. 
RICE: How are you, Commander Riker? 
RIKER: Me? Forget about me. How are you? No word, no message, nothing. 
RICE: How many are with you? 
RIKER: There are two others. Where's the Drake? Where's your crew? 
PICARD [OC]: Number One, a word. We have some information you should be
aware of.
