PICARD ELINE BATAI JR ADMINISTRATOR DOCTOR
week die leaves attention whilst exist year surgery flair

[Courtyard]

(more years have past. Eline is old and grey,
whilst Picard is still peering into his refractor telescope) 
ELINE: I put away your shoes for you again. 
PICARD: Yes, thank you, dear. 
ELINE: You know, I've been looking through this thing off and on for
over thirty years, and I still don't see what you and Meribor find so
fascinating. 
PICARD: Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you're
supposed to. 
ELINE: You treat me like some frail flower. People have surgery all the
time. 
(flute music starts up) 
ELINE: He loves playing. He's quite good at it, don't you think? 
PICARD: He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all he
wanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. I
wish he could find some focus in his life. 
ELINE: I think he has. Maybe you should talk to him. 
PICARD: Batai? 
BATAI JR: Father? 
PICARD: I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to
tell me. 
BATAI JR: Yes. I was waiting for the right moment, but that will never
come. I'm leaving school. 
PICARD: Leaving school? No, you're not. 
BATAI JR: I want to concentrate on my music. That's what I care about. 
PICARD: Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year before
that, botany. Now 
BATAI JR: Through it all, there was my music. I think you know that,
Father. This is the life I want. 
PICARD: Well, we'll discuss it. 
BATAI JR: Thank you, father. 
(Batai goes back indoors) 
ELINE: Even after all these years you still have the ability to
surprise me. 
PICARD: If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way?
Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream. 
ELINE: Are you still planning to talk to the Administrator tomorrow? 
PICARD: There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. 
ELINE: Unless, of course, you keep quiet. 
PICARD: No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. 
ELINE: What a surprise.

[Town square]

ADMINISTRATOR: Kamin, what do you hope to
accomplish? Spreading rumours that the planet is doomed. There could be
chaos. 
PICARD: The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will
recognise what they mean. 
ADMINISTRATOR: I won't be a party to your making trouble. 
PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Your observations, your findings, our scientists reached
those same conclusions two years ago. Well, what did you expect us to
do? Make it public? Can you imagine the effect? 
PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of this
world? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just
beginning to launch small missiles. 
PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. You
simply cannot let this civilisation die. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Enough! There is a plan in work. I cannot tell you more
than that. 
BATAI JR: Father! 
PICARD: What is it? 
BATAI JR: It's Mother. Hurry.

[Living room]

PICARD: Doctor? 
DOCTOR: Kamin. I'm sorry. 
ELINE: You see? I go to any lengths to get your attention. 
PICARD: You always did have a flair for the dramatic. 
ELINE: Doctor, thank you. (Doctor leaves) Batai, leave us alone for a
moment. I need to talk to my husband. 
(Batai leaves) 
ELINE: Did you show the Administrator your evidence? 
PICARD: I didn't have to. They already knew. 
ELINE: So, he won't throw you off the Council? 
PICARD: No. 
ELINE: Good. Remember, put your shoes away. 
PICARD: I promise. 
(Eline dies)
