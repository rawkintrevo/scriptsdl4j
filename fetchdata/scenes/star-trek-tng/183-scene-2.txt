LAFORGE: You know, I've noticed here that your
manoeuvring thrusters are rigged in a configuration I've never seen
before. 
DIRGO: It's my own modification. It's more efficient. You can study it
if you want to. 
(say Hi! to Nick Tate, aka Eagle pilot Carter from Space 1999) 
(Picard and Wesley enter) 
LAFORGE: Excuse me, Captain. I've run safety and operational
inspections, Captain. Everything checks out all right, but I won't make
any claims as to its comfort. 
DIRGO: Captain Picard. Captain Dirgo of the shuttlecraft Nenebek. 
PICARD: Ah, Captain. It's good to meet you. 
WESLEY: Captain? Of a mining shuttle? 
DIRGO: Yes, Ensign, Captain. My ship isn't pretty, she isn't big, but
we've logged almost ten thousand hours together. 
PICARD: Oh, yes. She seems a very sturdy craft. 
DIRGO: We should go. Captain, will you take Ops? 
PICARD: I'll let Ensign Crusher perform that task. I have to study up
on Regalian law.
