[Ready room]

WORF: We're modifying class one probes so they
become resonators. We will then use torpedo casings to protect them
once they begin burrowing beneath the surface. 
PICARD: How will these resonators destroy the crystals? 
HILDEBRANDT: By emitting harmonic vibrations which will shatter the
lattices. 
WORF: The Enterprise will monitor and adjust the frequency of the
resonators. 
RIKER: Sounds like a plan. Lets get started. 
(Worf and Hildebrandt leave. Data enters) 
DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. 
DATA: Captain, permission to beam down to Drema Four. 
PICARD: What? 
DATA: I have been unable to contact Sarjenka. 
PICARD: Data, I appreciate your concern. Transporting to the surface is
only going to make a bad situation worse. 
DATA: Sir, I feel it is important to determine the reason for 
RIKER: Come on, Data. 
DATA: Captain, your orders were to deliver the message, correct? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA: Then what is the difference between sending the message and
delivering it personally? 
RIKER: A whopping big one, and you know it. 
DATA: Sir, we have come this far. 
PICARD: In for a penny, in for a pound, is that what you're saying,
Mister Data? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Oh, hell. Go. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Number One, handle the transporter. Go. 
RIKER: Where would you say we are now, sir? 
(In over their heads) 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see any of
this. You're not involved. 
O'BRIEN: Right, sir. I'll just standing over here, dozing off. 
RIKER: Data, you've got ten minutes. That's it. If you meet anybody but
Sarjenka 
DATA: I will signal for immediate beam out. 
(Data is beamed down) 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker to the Bridge. 
RIKER: Damn. 
O'BRIEN: I just woke up, sir. 
RIKER: You know what to do? 
O'BRIEN: No problem, sir. I'll have him out of there as smooth as ice.

[Sarjenka's house]

(Constructed mainly of hexagons. There is a toy
doll on a bed of pillows. He finds the radio. The door is a forcefield
or hologram. Data touches it, it vanishes to reveal a red and sullen
outside, lit by erupting volcanoes. The ground shakes so he goes back
inside and closes the door. After a moment, a little girl runs in and
goes straight over to the radio. She has orange skin and hair, and all
her fingers are the same length) 
DATA: Sarjenka? Wait! I'm Data. 
SARJENKA: Data. Data, you came. Data, where have you been? 
DATA: It would take too long to explain. You and your family must
leave. 
SARJENKA: We already have. We ran when the tremors began. 
DATA: Then why are you here? 
SARJENKA: My father wouldn't let us take anything, but I had to have my
transmitter. I knew you would come back, and I didn't want you to find
only silence, the way I did. 
DATA: I am sorry for that, but it is very complicated. Does your family
know where you are? 
SARJENKA: No. 
DATA: You cannot survive in this. 
SARJENKA: What are we going to do? 
DATA: Enterprise, two to beam up. You must come with me. 
SARJENKA: Where are we going? (Data points upwards) To the stars? 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: There's going to be hell to pay. 
DATA: Where is Commander Riker? 
O'BRIEN: On the Bridge. Where are you going? 
DATA: To the Bridge. 
O'BRIEN: And you're going to take that? 
SARJENKA: Don't leave me here. Please don't leave me. 
DATA: Quite impossible.
