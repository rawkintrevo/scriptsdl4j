TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD GANGSTER DATA

[Holodeck - wall]

(the Gangster comes to a building with scaffolding,
and a wall where there is one brick missing from the middle) 
TROI: What are you doing here? 
GANGSTER: Laying the foundation. 
(he puts his brick into the gap, it glows then blends in with the rest
of the wall) 
GANGSTER: Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a train to catch.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I don't understand it, Captain. All of a
sudden, cargo bay five started to depressurise. 
PICARD: Did everyone get out in time? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir, and I've re-established the containment field, but
I'm reading massive power surges in the cargo bay and all sorts of
transporter activity. Something weird is happening there, Captain. 
PICARD: I want you to send a team down there immediately. Find out
what's going on. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
