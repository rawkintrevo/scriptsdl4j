site intend orbit number alien arrived forge destroy holodeck

[Bridge]

DATA: We are in synchronous orbit above the beam
down site, sir. 
PICARD: Good. Mister La Forge, how much longer before we can transport
the Boraalans? 
LAFORGE [OC]: A few more hours, Captain, but we've got some problems
here. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I don't think the holodeck's going to last
that long. We've had materialisation errors and resolution failures all
over the place, and it's getting worse. The simulation could fall apart
any minute. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We'll have the transporter room standing
by. But we may have to transport the Boraalans whether you're ready or
not. Please keep Mister Worf apprised. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. We still have one more problem
to worry about. 
[Vorin's quarters]

VORIN: Yes. 
PICARD: We have arrived at the planet that I told you about. Have you
made a decision? 
VORIN: I believe I would like to go back to my people. 
PICARD: I see. What do you intend to tell them? 
VORIN: I don't know. 
PICARD: If you tell them the truth, what will happen? Will they believe
you? 
VORIN: I'm not sure. It is a fantastic story. 
PICARD: Perhaps they will think that you have had an hallucination, or
that you're insane. 
VORIN: I don't think I would like to live my life knowing what I know
and being regarded as a madman. 
PICARD: On the other hand, they may believe your fantastic story. They
would learn about alien worlds, starships. 
VORIN: That would be disastrous. It would destroy everything they
believed in. I can't tell them the truth, but I don't think I can live
with a secret. 
PICARD: Then stay here. Make a future for yourself with us. 
VORIN: I need some time. Please.
