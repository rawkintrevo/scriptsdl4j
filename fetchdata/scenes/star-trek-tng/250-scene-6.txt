[Transporter room]

(everyone say Hi! to Doctor Mae Jemison, genuine
astronaut) 
GUEST1: Phase distortion is dropping. The second transport window opens
in forty two seconds. 
RIKER: How long will we have, Lieutenant? 
GUEST1: Thirty six minutes, sir. 
WORF: We are losing time. Lieutenant Riker should be here. 
RIKER: Computer, locate Lieutenant 
(he dashes in) 
RIKER: Cancel inquiry. 
WORF: You were supposed to report here at eight hundred hours. 
RIKER 2: I'm sorry, I was 
RIKER: I guess it's been a while since you've had to punch a clock.
Let's go. Energise.

[Research station]

RIKER 2: I've shut down most of the consoles to
save power. I re-routed just about everything through here. 
RIKER: Check out the primary EPS system. See if you can get some power
to the rest of these consoles. 
RIKER 2: I shunted the database to the main core underneath the
station. 
RIKER: Can we access it from here? 
RIKER 2: There's been a lot of seismic activity over the years. If the
servo-links were damaged we may not be able to. I'll try to tap into
the command pathways. You see if you can access and disable the file
server. 
(Riker 2 goes under a console while Number One sits on a chair) 
RIKER: You know, I've been thinking we should probably let Dad know
what happened. 
RIKER 2: I'm sure he'll be thrilled to know there are two of us now. 
RIKER: Actually, he and I have been able to patch a few things up. 
RIKER 2: I've been able to get by for a long time without seeing him.
I'm not about to start now. What made you contact him? 
RIKER: I didn't. He came on board the Enterprise to brief me when I was
offered the Aries. 
RIKER 2: What did he say when you turned down your own command? 
RIKER: He couldn't understand why I did it. 
RIKER 2: For once he and I agree on something. 
WORF: The primary EPS coupling is fused. The entire unit will have to
be replaced. 
RIKER 2: I've accessed the command pathways. The interlink pathways are
functioning now. 
RIKER: See if that did the trick. No, it's not working. 
RIKER 2: The servo-link must be damaged. We're going to have to go
under the station and access the core directly. 
DATA: We have less than three minutes left. 
RIKER 2: I'll stay here. I'll be finished by the time the third window
opens. 
RIKER: It's too dangerous. Our scans show the caverns are unstable. 
RIKER 2: I've been down there dozens of times. I know my way around. 
RIKER: We'll come back during the third window, We'll bring a new EPS
coupling and try to access the core from another console up here. Riker
to Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
RIKER: We're ready to beam out. 
RIKER 2: You go ahead. I'll be finished by the time you get back. 
RIKER: Hold it! I gave you an order, Lieutenant.
