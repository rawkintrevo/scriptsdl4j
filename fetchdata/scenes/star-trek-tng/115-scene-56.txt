TROI: Mistress Beata is willing to give you a
second chance. We're prepared to take your entire group with us. 
RAMSEY: That's very kind of you, but we're not going. 
TASHA: Haven't you been paying attention, Ramsey? You're scheduled to
be executed tomorrow. 
RAMSEY: We don't want to die. We don't want to leave, either. 
RIKER: There's no time to debate the issues. You're going with us
whether you choose to go or not. 
DATA: Excuse me, Commander, but removing any of these people against
their will would be a violation of several Starfleet regulations, not
the least of which would be the Prime Directive. 
RIKER: I realise that, Mister Data. I'd rather face a court martial
than live with the guilt of leaving these people to their deaths.
Commander Riker to Enterprise. 
CRUSHER [OC]: This is the Enterprise. Crusher here. 
TASHA: It must be worse up there than we thought. 
RIKER: Doctor, where is Lieutenant La Forge?

CRUSHER: I can't allow it.

here. Until I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I can't let anyone
new be exposed. 
RIKER: Doctor, these people are facing their deaths down here.

CRUSHER: They might be facing the same thing up
here. Until I have a better idea of what I'm dealing with, no one can
beam up. I'm sorry, Will, but you must wait. 
[Holding area]

RIKER: Understood. Doctor, would this virus have
any effect on Mister Data? 
CRUSHER [OC]: Not likely. 
RIKER: You're going back there alone. I want you to get the Enterprise
into the Neutral Zone before it's too late. 
DATA: This is Data, standing by to beam up. 
(He beams away) 
TROI: What of them? 
RIKER: I don't know, Deanna. 
[Guest quarters]

TRENT: Mistress Beata invites you to witness this
morning's reaffirmation of Angel One's moral imperative. 
TASHA: Is that the civilised word for murder on this world? 
RIKER: You send Mistress Beata our regrets. 
TRENT: The Elected One will not look fondly upon 
DATA: [OC]: Enterprise to Commander Riker. 
TROI: They're still here! 
RIKER: Riker here. Data, I gave you direct orders to get to Neutral
Zone immediately. Explain the delay.

[Bridge]

DATA: To be precise, Commander, you ordered me to
reach the Neutral Zone before it is too late.

DATA: After relieving Lieutenant La Forge, I
computed the length of time the border outpost

DATA: And the USS Berlin can safely withstand a
Romulan attack, and deducted our time to destination at maximum warp
speed. That leaves Doctor Crusher forty eight minutes to develop an
