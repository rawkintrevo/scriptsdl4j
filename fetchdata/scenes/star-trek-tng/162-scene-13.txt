[Holodeck - Space Station Living quarters ]

GUEST0: (handing out the drinks) Commander. 
APGAR: To success. 
RIKER: Success. 
APGAR: Well, in a way, I suppose it's good that you're early. Manua's
right, it gives me a chance to show you the progress we've been making.

RIKER: I'd appreciate it if Commander La Forge and I could stay here
until the Enterprise returns. 
(Riker is continually staring at Manua) 
GUEST0: It's a little inconvenient. 
RIKER: It would help to accelerate the process. 
APGAR: Well, if you wish, Commander. Now, where shall I start? Well,
first of all, you should know that I am very close to being able to
collimate a Krieger field.

[Holodeck - Space Station Guest quarters]

GUEST0: Our guest quarters are very modest. 
RIKER: Very charming. It has your touch. 
GUEST0: The station is small, and we don't often have guests. I use this
as my sanctuary. 
RIKER: Who do you need sanctuary from? 
GUEST0: The environmental controls are here. 
(Riker closes the doors) 
GUEST0: Commander, please. It's late and I'm tired. 
RIKER: A man more interested in Krieger waves than in a lovely woman
like you. How is that possible? 
GUEST0: My husband is one of the great minds in the galaxy and we love
each other very much. 
(Riker pulls her towards him) 
GUEST0: Please don't. 
RIKER: It must be very lonely. A princess in a very high tower. 
GUEST0: Please, my husband will be looking for me. 
RIKER: Your sanctuary, remember? 
(Riker slips her dress off her shoulders) 
GUEST0: Commander, don't, please! 
RIKER: (the real one) She's lying! That never happened. 
PICARD: Freeze programme. 
GUEST0: Please. 
(Programme stops) 
RIKER: Captain, you know I would never act like that. 
PICARD: Commander Riker! 
RIKER: This isn't me. I wasn't the one who closed the door. I didn't
proposition her and I certainly didn't try to rape her. Why are you
doing this? 
GUEST0: (real one) It's exactly what happened. 
TROI: Will, come on, sit down. 
KRAG: Resume programme. 
GUEST0: Please. 
(Apgar enters) 
APGAR: I knew you'd try this, Riker. Do you think I didn't notice how
you looked at her? I'm not the fool you take me for. 
(Apgar takes a swing at him, gets blocked and is given two punches to
the stomach in return) 
APGAR: You won't get away with this. Your career is over. I'll see to
it. I swear I will, Riker. 
RIKER: If you report this, you'll be making a terrible mistake, Doctor.
A terrible mistake. 
(Apgar and Manua leave) 
KRAG: Freeze programme. 
GUEST0: Your career was safe. He was a scientist. In another day some
fascinating bit of technical trivia would have distracted him. He would
have forgotten about you and his complaint to Starfleet. Excuse me. 
(Manua leaves the holodeck) 
PICARD: We'll, um, we'll take a short recess. 
(Picard and Krag leave) 
RIKER: Why would she lie like that? She was lying. You could tell. 
TROI: Will, I didn't sense any deception from her. 
RIKER: Then you think that I? 
TROI: No! No, of course not. I know you. You don't have to convince me
of anything. 
RIKER: We can't both be telling the truth. 
TROI: It is the truth as each of you remembers it. 
RIKER: But her version puts a noose around my neck.
