[1701-C Bridge] 
(Flames, charred bodies across consoles wearing
late TOS movie uniforms. The away team beam in.) 
RIKER: Captain Garrett? 
GARRETT: Yes. 
RIKER: I'm Commander William Riker. Our emergency teams are on board
your ship. Doctor? 
CRUSHER: The rest of the bridge crew is dead. She has a bad fracture
and has serious internal injuries. I'm going to have to get her back to
the Enterprise. 
GARRETT: To where? 
RIKER: We'll explain that later. 
GARRETT: You'll explain now, Commander. 
RIKER: We're from a Federation starship. We answered your distress
call. Your ship is in good hands, but we need to get you to our
Sickbay. 
GARRETT: Very well. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to transporter room. Two to beam directly to Sickbay. 
CREWMAN: Stand by for transport. 
(Crusher and Garrett are beamed away) 
LAFORGE: It's pretty bad, Commander. Looks like they were in a hell of
a fight. 
RIKER: If you can't stabilise the life support, we're going to have to
evacuate the ship. 
LAFORGE: I think we can do it. I'll have to get to Engineering though.
La Forge to damage control team alpha. Meet me on Engineering level
three. 
TASHA: Commander. 
(A sound of coughing. They move some debris and find another survivor) 
CASTILLO: Thanks. 
RIKER: Commander William Riker. 
CASTILLO: Lieutenant Castillo, helmsman. 
[1701D Bridge]

DATA: Away team reporting in, sir. 
PICARD: On screen, Mister Data. Go ahead, Commander. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: We've stabilised life support. Mister La Forge
is working on restoring the main power couplings, but that'll take
time. It's a real mess down here, sir. 
PICARD: Survivors? 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: One hundred twenty five. 
PICARD: Recommendation? 
RIKER: I'd hate to have to scrap her. Starfleet could certainly use
another ship, even if she is old. 
PICARD: Agreed. But we can't stay in this area too long. You have nine
hours. If you can get her underway by then,
we'll escort her back to Starbase one oh five. If not, we'll evacuate
the survivors and destroy the ship. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Understood, sir. 
PICARD: Keep me posted, Picard out. 
(Guinan enters, looking around a lot) 
PICARD: Guinan? 
GUINAN: We need to talk. Somehow this, this is all wrong. This is not
the way it's supposed to be.

[Ready room]

PICARD: You must have some idea how things have
changed. 
GUINAN: I look at things, I look at people, and they just don't feel
right. 
PICARD: What things? What people? 
GUINAN: You. Your uniform. The Bridge. 
PICARD: What's the matter with the Bridge? 
GUINAN: It's not right. 
PICARD: It's the same Bridge. Nothing has changed. 
GUINAN: I know that. I also know it's wrong. 
PICARD: What else? 
GUINAN: Families. There should be children on this ship. 
PICARD: What? Children on the Enterprise? Guinan, we're at war. 
GUINAN: No, we're not. At least, we're not supposed to be. This is not
a ship of war. This a ship of peace. 
PICARD: What you're suggesting 
GUINAN: I'm not suggesting. That ship from the past is not supposed to
be here. It's got to go back.
