[Bridge]

RIKER: All stations have reported, Captain. There
appears to be no immediate threat to our ship or the crew. 
PICARD: Let's hold this position for a while, Number One. This is worth
studying. 
RIKER: Incredible. It's like looking into infinity, sir. Remember the
course in ancient history at Starfleet Academy? About the time men
still believed the Earth was flat? 
PICARD: And that the sun revolved around it. 
RIKER: And that if a ship sailed too far out into the ocean, it would
fall off the edge of the world? 
PICARD: Beyond this place there be dragons. It's even said that crews
threatened to hang their captain from the yard arm if he refused to
turn back. 
RIKER: I'm sure no one here has that in mind, sir. 
PICARD: How comforting, Number One. 
WESLEY: Captain, we have no communications outside of the void. 
RIKER: Complete your scans, Data. Let's not stay any longer than we
have to. 
(Pulaski enters) 
PICARD: Hello, Doctor. Have you been briefed on what's happened? 
PULASKI: I heard, but I don't understand it, Captain. 
PICARD: I wish I could say I did. Increase magnification by ten. By one
hundred. 
PULASKI: Isn't this impossible, sir? I'm not a Bridge officer, but.
Increase by one thousand, Mister Data. By ten thousand. It does know
how to do these things, doesn't it? 
PICARD: Commander Data knows precisely what he is doing. 
PULASKI: Forgive me, Mister Data. I'm not accustomed to working with
non-living devices that. Forgive me again. Your service record says
that you are alive. I must accept that. 
PICARD: Engineering! 
LAFORGE [OC]: Engineering. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, are all your systems functioning? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain. Wherever we are, it seems to have no effect on
Engineering. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Data? 
DATA: Difficult to make a judgment, sir, based on the absence of
information. 
PICARD: Speculate. 
DATA: This void has a total lack of dimension. Therefore, by any
accepted standard, it does not exist, yet being within it denies that
conclusion. 
RIKER: Might we have moved into another dimension? 
DATA: Could a lack of dimension be another dimension in itself? 
PULASKI: That's an interesting question. 
PICARD: For a later discussion. Number One, I think we should get on
with our mission. Starfleet can send a science vessel back to
investigate further. Move us back out of here. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. Wesley, reverse our direction, set a course for the
Cornelian star system. Impulse power. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Reversing direction. Course laid in. 
RIKER: Engage. 
(We see the Enterprise whizz off, but nothing changes on the
viewscreen) 
RIKER: Your engines have engaged, haven't they, Ensign? 
WESLEY: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge, I'd like you to
monitor our velocity closely. LAFORGE: Is everything all right up
there, Captain? 
PICARD [OC]: Are the engines operating normally? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Everything looks fine down here. 
PICARD [OC]: We're increasing to warp two. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
