CRUSHER: Captain, we have a problem. Take a look at
this. Her tissue is breaking down on a cellular level and it's
spreading. At first I thought it was a rash from the coil brace she was
stabbed with, but when I used the interphasic scanner, I found this. 
(a blue light shows a creature eating Troi's skin) 
PICARD: What is it? 
CRUSHER: The question is, what are they? 
(there's one on her own arm) 
CRUSHER: I've tested all the medical staff and I've found them on
almost everyone so far. The cellular decay is accelerating in all
cases. I haven't found a way to stop it or even slow it down. (there's
one on Riker's temple) Looks like you're infected too. The organisms
appear to be attached to our epidermal layers with osmotic tendrils.
They're tapping directly into the bloodstream. (Picard has one on his
throat) And from what I can tell, they're spreading.

RIKER: What are we dealing with here? Are these
creatures feeding on us? 
CRUSHER: Yes, in a very particular way. They appear to be extracting
our cellular peptides. It's roughly analogous to the way terran leeches
consume haemoglobin. If they're not removed soon, our bodies are going
to lose all their cellular cohesion. We'll collapse into nothing but a
few pounds of chemicals. 
PICARD: All right. Is there any way that we can affect these organisms?

LAFORGE: We've tried EM radiation, subspace fields, thermal protons,
nothing's worked. They seem to exist in some sort of interphasic state,
just beyond our range of visual and sensor acuity. The only way we can
see them is to use an IP scanner. Tricorders can't even pick them up. 
RIKER: Do we know where these things came from, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I scanned the vicinity with an IP scanner. There is no sign of
any similar creatures, or any unusual interphasic activity. 
PICARD: What about Mister Data? There must be some connection between
his odd behaviour and these creatures. Is he infested as well? 
CRUSHER: No. I scanned him, but I found nothing. 
PICARD: Data attacked Counsellor Troi because he saw a mouth on her
shoulder. And in that same area that we first saw one of the organisms.

RIKER: Data also saw a straw in my head and then Beverly discovered an
organism in the same place. 
LAFORGE: Those images are all part of Data's dream. Maybe somehow he's
unconsciously perceiving these creatures. 
PICARD: Then perhaps it is time that we took a closer look at Mister
Data's dreams.
