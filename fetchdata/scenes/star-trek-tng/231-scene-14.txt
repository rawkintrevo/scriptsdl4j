[Corridor]

CREWMAN: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Gordon. 
(Geordi rings a doorbell)

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Who is it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: It's La Forge. 
RIKER: Come in. LAFORGE: Good morning. 
RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. 
LAFORGE: Commander, it's oh seven hundred hours.

[Barber shop]

MOT: She said, if they're not squirming, we won't
eat 'em! 
(Worf enters) 
MOT: Ah, Mister Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it
is to have you with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today?
Trim your beard? 
WORF: I would like my hair trimmed. 
MOT: Ah. A trim, of course. 
WORF: Not like last time. 
MOT: Oh no, just a little off the top. I took way too much off last
time. I was just telling my colleague, Mister Setti, how thick and
luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes I get
carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the
elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest that you
start using a conditioning agent. 
(Worf sees the scissors and grabs Mot's arm) 
MOT: I promise, not too much off the top. 
(Worf leaves)

[Cargo bay]

(Geordi is up a ladder, looking inside a panel) 
LAFORGE: Just before the grid alarm sounded, we were running warp power
through this junction. Somehow, it must've tripped the internal
scanners. 
RIKER: And it showed up as an EPS explosion? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but the question is, why? I've made modifications to the
sensors before but nothing like this has ever happened. 
(He comes down the ladder) 
RIKER: We can't waste time chasing down sensor ghosts. We should
probably keep the whole array offline until we can get take a closer
look. 
LAFORGE: (yawns) Excuse me. 
RIKER: I know the feeling. The past few nights, it seems like as soon
as my head hits the pillow, it's time to get up in the morning. 
LAFORGE: I'm sure we could all use a little shore leave after this
survey's completed. 
RIKER: Definitely. Keep me posted? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. Data, I'm wondering if you could give me a hand. I need
to run a structural integrity scan. I want to make sure that none of
the conduit was 
(Geordi sways) 
DATA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: This is the second time today that my visor's just cut out
like that. 
DATA: Are you all right, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I just had a very weird feeling. Maybe I should
go to Sickbay. 
DATA: I will run the integrity scan. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This is curious. There's a slight
bacterial infection around your neural inputs. It was probably
interrupting the data stream. 
LAFORGE: An infection? From what? 
CRUSHER: It doesn't match any bacterial strains on record. I'm going to
have to sterilise the area. But I need to run a resonance tissue scan
to search for any signs of additional infection. Come over here. Sit
down. Now, come forward. Now, you're going to need to hold very still.

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: How's the scan going, Data? 
DATA: I have just started the scan. Did you not go to Sickbay? 
LAFORGE: Data, I've been there for over an hour and a half. 
DATA: That is not possible. My internal chronometer indicates you have
been gone for exactly one minute, fifteen seconds. 
LAFORGE: I'm telling you, Data, I've been gone for over an hour. 
DATA: Computer, what is the time, please? 
COMPUTER: The time is fourteen twenty seven hours. 
DATA: You are correct. Ninety two minutes, seventeen seconds have
passed since you left the room. 
LAFORGE: What have you been doing all this time? 
DATA: I have no memory of events during that period. When we are
finished here, I will perform a self-diagnostic. 
LAFORGE: You know, first we picked up a false EPS explosion, then my
visor cuts out twice, and now you lose an hour, all in the Cargo Bay.
La Forge to Engineering I want a diagnostic team to Cargo bay four
immediately. 
SHIPLEY [OC]: On our way, sir.
