PICARD TROI RIKER WORF WESLEY

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Lieutenant? 
WORF: We had completed our investigation of the third tunnel. Our scans
had indicated no weapons or traps of any kind. Lieutenant Aster was
three metres behind me. An explosive device went off. There was no
warning. Lieutenant Aster bore the full brunt of the detonation. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: Lieutenant Aster is survived by a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old.
He's aboard the Enterprise, sir. 
PICARD: And his father? 
TROI: He's also deceased. His only living relatives are an aunt and
uncle residing on Earth. 
PICARD: Where is he now? 
TROI: In class. I've alerted the teacher to expect us.
WORF: Captain. I must accompany you. I commanded the away team. 
PICARD: I appreciate your offer, Lieutenant, but this is my
responsibility. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Picard to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Assign Commander La Forge to lead another away team to the dig
site. I want to know why this happened. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: I will be with Counsellor Troi

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: And young Jeremy Aster. 
RIKER: I understand. Riker out. 
WESLEY: He had to do the same thing for me. 
RIKER: Do you know Jeremy well? 
WESLEY: But I know this is going to be like for him. 
RIKER: That's part of life in Starfleet, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I know. They're very careful to prepare us for anything, but
still 
RIKER: I know. 
WESLEY: How do you get used to it? Telling them? 
RIKER: You hope you never do.
