directly to Sickbay.

face) 
[Hillside]

RIKER: Doctor, be careful. 
CRUSHER: I've got to get down there. 
(Oji hides and watches as Crusher runs down to Liko, scans him then
makes her decision) 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Enterprise. Medical emergency. Two to beam directly
to Sickbay. 
OGAWA [OC]: Aye, Doctor. 
(Oji sees the strange woman and her father vanish) 
[Duck blind]

LAFORGE: That should do it. 
(It does. Oji sees the window disappear and be replaced by the cliff
face. Curious, she investigates)
