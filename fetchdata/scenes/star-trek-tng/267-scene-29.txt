[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit just
because I'm unbeatable? 
LAFORGE: Nah, there's something I need to do down in Engineering. I'll
get you next time. 
RIKER: I'll be there. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight, everybody. 
TROI + CRUSHER: Goodnight. 
[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

SITO: Bye. 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
OGAWA: See you later. 
(Sito and Ogawa leave) 
TAURIK: What I find curious is that when Commander La Forge saw that
the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed
annoyed. 
BEN: Of course he was. 
LAVELLE: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't. 
TAURIK: Do you think I have irreparably damaged my relationship with
him? 
LAVELLE: It depends on what kind of a guy he is. 
BEN: Ante up, gentlemen. 
(doorbell) LAVELLE: Come in. 
(La Forge enters) 
LAVELLE: Commander. 
LAFORGE: As you were. I just dropped by to see Taurik. 
TAURIK: What can I do for you, sir? 
LAFORGE: Well, I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests on the
nacelles. Since you've already put in some work on the technique, I
thought you might like to give me a hand. 
TAURIK: I'd be pleased to, sir. 
LAFORGE: Great. Let's go. 
(La Forge and Taurik leave) 
BEN: How about some blackjack? 
LAVELLE: I've got to get some sleep so I can be sharp tomorrow. 
BEN: Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have
to get to sleep even earlier? 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come in. 
CRUSHER: Ben. What are you doing here? 
BEN: I just cleaned out some junior officers and I thought I'd do the
same here. 
RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try. 
TROI: Pull up a chair. 
BEN: Thanks. 
[Gymnasium]

(a martial arts class has just finished) 
WORF: Dismissed. Ensign Sito. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
WORF: I also teach an advanced class. I believe you may be ready to
participate. However, before you can join the group, you must pass the
gik'tal. 
SITO: Gik'tal? 
WORF: Yes. It is a very ancient Klingon ritual. It tests your knowledge
of the forms of the mok'bara. 
SITO: I should practice first. 
WORF: No. No practise. That is part of the ritual. The test must be
unannounced. 
(Worf blindfolds her) 
WORF: Can you see? 
SITO: No. 
WORF: Good. The gik'tal has begun. Defend yourself. 
(of course, he easily throws her) 
WORF: You must anticipate my attack. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
WORF: Defend yourself. 
(once again, she has no idea where he is before she lands on her back) 
WORF: Are you listening, Ensign? 
SITO: Yes, but 
WORF: Defend yourself. 
(and a third time) 
WORF: You did not anticipate. 
(Sito removes the blindfold) 
SITO: How am I supposed to defend myself when I can't see a thing? 
WORF: Stop making excuses. Replace the blindfold. 
SITO: No. It's not a fair test. 
WORF: Very good, Ensign. You have passed the challenge. 
SITO: What? By taking off the blindfold? 
WORF: It takes courage to say the test is unfair. 
SITO: One thing I don't understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean to the death? 
WORF: You speak Klingon. 
SITO: Sir, is there really such a thing as a gik'tal challenge? 
WORF: No, there is not. But perhaps next time you are judged unfairly,
it will not take so many bruises for you protest.

[Ready room]

SITO: All I've ever wanted is to make a career for
myself in Starfleet. I can't change what happened at the Academy. No
one can. All I can do is work hard and try to earn the respect of the
people I serve with. If you're not going to give me that chance, then I
respectfully request that you transfer me to another ship. 
PICARD: If you're looking for a more lenient commander, I don't think
you'll find one. 
SITO: Permission to speak freely, sir? 
PICARD: Please do. 
SITO: If you didn't want me on your ship you should have said so when I
was assigned to it. It's not your place to punish me for what I did at
the Academy. I've worked hard here. My record is exemplary. If you're
going to judge me, judge me for what I am now. 
PICARD: Very well, Ensign. I will. It took courage to come here and
face me after what I said to you the other day. I didn't ask you here
because I was assessing your qualifications for the Ops position. 
SITO: I don't understand, sir. 
PICARD: I was harsh with you because I wanted to assess you for a very
important mission. A mission that could put you in a situation that
would be far more unnerving than a dressing-down by your commanding
officer. 
SITO: Can I ask what that mission is, sir? 
PICARD: Join the senior officers in the Observation lounge at oh nine
hundred hours. We'll discuss it then. 
SITO: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: And, Ensign. I do know why you ended up on the Enterprise. I
asked for you. I wanted to make sure that you got a fair chance to
redeem yourself. 
SITO: Thank you, sir. 
[Sickbay]

OGAWA: You wanted to see me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Alyssa, I think you know how much I've come to depend
upon you here. I've recommended your promotion because your performance
here has been exemplary. 
OGAWA: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. 
CRUSHER: But more than that, I've come to think of you as a friend.
Someone I really care about. 
OGAWA: That's nice of you to say. I feel the same way. 
CRUSHER: So, you and Andrew Powell? 
OGAWA: Someone told you. 
CRUSHER: Told me what? 
OGAWA: We were going to keep it a secret until the promotions are
announced. 
CRUSHER: Secret? 
OGAWA: He asked me to marry him. 
CRUSHER: Alyssa, that's wonderful! I'm so relieved. I mean happy.
