RIKER LAFORGE PICARD LAFORGE [OC] TIMICIN DATA
good level radiation warp looking lights predicted stable pressure

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Temperature at ninety million degrees
Kelvin. And now one hundred ten million. Looking good.
One hundred thirty seven. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Radiation and pressure levels still stable. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Temperature is one hundred and seventy million degrees
Kelvin.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: One ninety. And now two hundred million. 
TIMICIN: It's happening. 
LAFORGE: Two oh seven and rising. Two nineteen. And twenty. Two twenty.
And holding. Looks like congratulations may be in order.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Turbulence patterns are within predicted parameters.

[Engineering]

(Composite sensor analysis 4077 display) 
LAFORGE: Two twenty two.

[Bridge]

DATA: Temperature is rising in the core again,
Captain. Two hundred and thirty million degrees Kelvin. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Still rising, Captain.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Two fifty one. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Rate exceeding critical level. Core density
is becoming unstable. 
RIKER: Let's get the hell out of here. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp two now!
