[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Naturally I've heard of your case. The
visor implants you wear 
LAFORGE: Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I
quote see much of the EM spectrum ranging from simple heat and infrared
through radio waves et cetera, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said
and listened to this a thousand times before. 
(Without the Visor, Geordi La Forge's eyes are white sightless orbs,
and he has flashing red lights at his temples) 
CRUSHER: You've been blind all your life? 
LAFORGE: I was born this way. 
CRUSHER: And you've felt pain all the years that you've used this? 
LAFORGE: They say it's because I use my natural sensors in different
ways. 
CRUSHER: Well, I see two choices. The first is painkillers. 
LAFORGE: Which would affect how this works. No. Choice number two? 
CRUSHER: Exploratory surgery. Desensitise the brain areas troubling
you. 
LAFORGE: Same difference. No, thank you, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I understand. 
LAFORGE: See you.

(Riker enters) 
WORF: Yes sir? 
RIKER: Where will I find Commander Data? 
WORF: Commander Data is on special assignment, sir. He's using our
shuttlecraft to transfer an admiral over to the Hood. 
RIKER: An admiral? 
WORF: He's been aboard all day, sir, checking over medical layout. 
RIKER: Why a shuttlecraft? Why wouldn't he just beam over? 
WORF: I suppose he could, sir, but the Admiral's a rather remarkable
man.

(A very old man in a cardigan is shuffling along.
He is played by DeForrest Kelley, so of course we name this character
-)
MCCOY: Have you got some reason you want my atoms scattered all over
space, boy?
DATA: No sir. But at your age, sir, I thought you shouldn't have to put
up with the time and trouble of a shuttlecraft. 
MCCOY: Hold it right there, boy. 
DATA: Sir? 
MCCOY: What about my age? 
DATA: Sorry, sir. If that subject troubles you 
MCCOY: Troubles me? What's so damned troubling about not having died?
How old do you think I am? 
DATA: One hundred thirty seven years, Admiral, according to Starfleet
records. 
MCCOY: Explain how you remember that so exactly. 
DATA: I remember every fact I am exposed to, sir. 
MCCOY: I don't see any points on your ears, boy, but you sound like a
Vulcan. 
DATA: No, sir. I'm an android. 
MCCOY: Almost as bad. 
DATA: I thought it was generally accepted, sir, that Vulcans are an
advanced and most honourable race. 
MCCOY: They are, they are. And damned annoying at times. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
MCCOY: Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. Now you
remember that, you hear. 
DATA: I will, sir. 
MCCOY: You treat her like a lady, and she'll always bring you home.

PICARD: Did you signal the Hood, Commander Riker? 
RIKER: Your exact message. Bon voyage mon ami. 
PICARD: What was my answer, computer? 
Q [OC]: You're wasting time, Captain. (appears on viewscreen) Or did
you think I was gone? 
PICARD: Lieutenant! Do you intend to blast a hole through the viewer?
If the purpose of this is to test humans, your honour, we must proceed
in our own way. 
Q [on viewscreen]: You are dilatory. You have twenty four hours. Any
further delay and you risk summary judgement against you, Captain. 
WORF: Sorry, sir 
RIKER: You reacted fast, Mister Worf. 
PICARD: But futilely. 
WORF: I will learn to do better, sir. 
PICARD: Of course you will. We've a long voyage ahead of us. 
RIKER: What do we do now, Captain? With them monitoring our every move
and every word. 
PICARD: We do exactly what we would do if this Q never existed. If
we're going to be damned, let's be damned for what we really are.

PICARD [OC]: Personal log, stardate 41153.8. Of the twenty four
hours Q allotted us to prove ourselves, eleven have now passed without
incident. And yet I cannot forget Q's prediction that we will face some
critical test.
