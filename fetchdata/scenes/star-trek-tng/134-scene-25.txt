TACTICS: The Enterprise has raised its shields. 
RIKER: That's normal procedure when entering into a suspicious
situation. It's not an act of aggression. The Enterprise will not fire
first. 
KARGAN: Then they are fools, for we will. 
RIKER: You'll get only one shot. 
KARGAN: We'll only need one. Stand by on phasers and torpedoes. Prepare
to fire them simultaneously. 
RIKER: I recommend you don't fire until you're within forty thousand
kilometres. 
KLAG: Why? 
RIKER: It will cut down their response time. 
KLAG: You are honouring your promise to serve us? 
RIKER: Would you do less? 
KARGAN: You will give the order to fire, Commander Riker. Call out
distances. Any questions, Mister Riker? 
RIKER: There's one thing I'd like to say. I question your judgment. In
my opinion, your reason for forcing this confrontation is not valid. 
KARGAN: Are you finished? 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
KARGAN: Commence with attack as ordered. 
KLAG: Fifty five thousand kilometres and closing. 
(Riker takes the emergency transponder from his boot) 
KARGAN: Is that a weapon, Commander? 
RIKER: No, sir. 
(Riker switches it on) 
KARGAN: Give it to me.

WORF: We are getting an emergency signal from a
command transponder. Location zero three five mark three one three.
Frequency and code designate it as Commander Riker. 
PICARD: Chief O'Brien, lock onto that transponder signal.

O'BRIEN: Yes, Captain. We're not yet in safe range
for a transfer
