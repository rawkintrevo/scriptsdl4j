RIKER ISHARA LAFORGE WORF PICARD DATA

[Transporter room]

(Worf and Ishara enter) 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Riker. Is your away team ready? 
RIKER: Waiting for your signal, sir.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Status, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Phasers in alignment and ready to fire. 
PICARD: How far must we penetrate to safely allow transporter function?

LAFORGE: One point six kilometres. 
PICARD: Fire phasers. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(The beam begins drilling into the planet surface) 
LAFORGE: One point three kilometres. One point four. One point five
kilometres. One point six kilometres. Deep enough for transport, sir. 
PICARD: Cease fire. Mister O'Brien, energise.

[Tunnel]

(The team beam in and move off slowly, weapons
drawn) 
ISHARA: This way. 
WORF: Caution is indicated. 
ISHARA: We're near the heart of the Alliance. Security is minimal here.
They aren't expecting anybody this far in. 
RIKER: Ishara? 
ISHARA: Follow me. 
WORF: Are you certain? 
ISHARA: No, I'm not. I'm trying to remember. I was here, but it was a
long time ago. There have been changes. It's through here. 
(a man is guarding a door) 
ISHARA: There. Your men are behind that door. 
(Riker, Worf and Data move forward. Riker shoots the guard, then he and
Worf phaser open the door)

[Chamber]

RIKER: Hold out your hands. 
(He uses his phaser to undo their handcuffs) 
(Meanwhile, Ishara is heading off somewhere else. She shoots a guard,
but he manages to use his weapon to set off an alarm) 
RIKER: Let's get moving.

[Tunnel]

RIKER: Where is she? 
WORF: Commander, look. 
RIKER: What the hell happened here? 
WORF: She probably tried to draw their fire. It triggered the alarm. 
RIKER: Worf, get these men back to the Enterprise. 
WORF: Come on. 
RIKER: Data, you're with me.

[Power generator room]

(Ishara takes out the guard, then breaks into the
generator's control panel and taps in commands) 
DATA: Ishara. What are you doing? The fusion generator is overloading.
You are attempting to disable the defence system. For what reason? We
have rescued the crewmen. 
ISHARA: I don't care about your crewmen. We have three thousand troops
waiting at the perimeter. When the defences go down, they'll come in.
The Alliance will fall. 
DATA: The Federation will be responsible for the resulting deaths. I
cannot allow that. 
ISHARA: You don't have a choice. 
DATA: That is not so. 
ISHARA: I don't want to kill you, Data. But I will. 
DATA: We will both be destroyed by the explosion. 
ISHARA: The Coalition's been all I've had for fifteen years. They've
given me a life. I don't mind dying for them. But you won't have to if
you just get out of here now. 
DATA: Was this your intention from the beginning? 
ISHARA: We never could have gotten this deep into Alliance territory
without your help. 
DATA: Our help was not deliberate. You deceived us. 
ISHARA: What's the difference? You got what you came for. Why do you
care about what we do? 
DATA: Your friendship with me was part of the deception, was it not?
You misled me at each step, and yet I was completely unaware. 
ISHARA: That doesn't matter now! None of it does! Now get out of here,
Data, please. Now! 
DATA: My duty requires me to intercede. 
(Data dodges her phaser shot) 
RIKER: Ishara! 
(She fires at Riker and Data stuns her. Then he goes to the control
panel and stops the overload) 
RIKER: What was she doing? 
DATA: Disabling the detection system so her forces could attack. 
RIKER: (looking at her phaser) Set to kill.
