PICARD PERRIN SAREK

[Guest quarters]

PERRIN: Come in. 
PICARD: I hope I'm not intruding. 
PERRIN: Not at all, Captain, but Sarek is in meditation at the moment. 
PICARD: Actually, I came to see you. 
PERRIN: Well, how nice. I so rarely get visitors of my own. Usually
everyone wants to see the Ambassador. 
PICARD: I find that hard to believe. Thank you. 
(They sit) 
PERRIN: These quarters are quite comfortable. The Ambassador and I were
very pleased when we heard that the negotiations were going to take
place aboard the flagship of the Federation. 
PICARD: The honour is ours. 
PERRIN: My husband has taken an interest in your career. He finds it to
be satisfactory. 
PICARD: My word! High praise from a Vulcan. 
PERRIN: Some people who expect an emotional response often find Vulcans
quite cold when they are merely being 
PICARD: Logical. 
PERRIN: Exactly. 
PICARD: I came to invite you, and your husband if he is available, to a
Mozart recital this evening. 
PERRIN: What a tempting offer. I doubt that the Ambassador will be able
to attend, but I will make it a point to ask him. 
PICARD: Well, then I hope to see you tonight. 
PERRIN: As do I.

[Guest quarters - bedroom]

PERRIN: You are still unable to meditate? 
SAREK: It is of no importance. 
PERRIN: It has eluded you for many weeks. 
SAREK: I said it is of no importance. 
PERRIN: You know I am right. 
SAREK: My wife, you will leave me now. I require solitude.
