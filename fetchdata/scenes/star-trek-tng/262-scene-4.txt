[Ten Forward]

(Juliana is having a meal when Data walks up to her
table) 
JULIANA: Data? 
DATA: I would like to get to know you better, Mother.

[Corridor]

JULIANA: I wanted to make you female, but your
father insisted on a son. We argued about it endlessly, right up until
we were ready to assemble you. 
DATA: How did you decide? 
JULIANA: Noonian walked in with your head in his hand and, innocent as
you please, said it was up to me. He knew perfectly well what he was
doing. Once again he had made it in his own image. What could I
possibly say? (reads door name plate) Deanna Troi, is that who you're
going to visit? 
DATA: Yes. 
JULIANA: Your father would be so pleased. 
DATA: Pleased? 
JULIANA: He was worried that the sexuality programme he designed for
you wouldn't work. 
DATA: You misunderstand. Counsellor Troi is a therapist. 
JULIANA: Goodnight. 
[Engineering]

DATA: We will be in position over the drilling site
in three minutes twenty nine seconds. 
(Juliana rests her hand on his shoulder) 
DATA: These scans indicate that the magma pockets where we plan to set
up the infusion units are somewhat unstable. 
JULIANA: I'm going to monitor the density of the rock layers and adjust
the strength of the particle beam as we go. That should minimise the
seismic stress that we generate while we're drilling. 
LAFORGE: Data, I reconfigured the phasers to create the most highly
focused particle beam possible. 
DATA: Thank you, Geordi. 
JULIANA: I'm just so pleased you've got good manners. It wasn't easy to
strike the right balance with your programming. At first you couldn't
have cared less about the social niceties like please and thank you.
You were downright rude, in fact. 
LAFORGE: Data? That's hard to picture. 
JULIANA: That was nothing to the problems we encountered. Never mind. I
don't want to embarrass you. 
DATA: I am incapable of embarrassment. Please continue. 
JULIANA: Well, the one thing we couldn't anticipate was that you didn't
seem to mind about being naked. Some of the colonists objected to
having an anatomically correct android running around without any
clothes on. We asked you to dress, but you didn't feel it was necessary
because you didn't suffer from the elements. We actually had to write a
modesty sub-routine to get you to keep your clothes on. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Engineering. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. Go ahead, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: We've established a synchronous orbit over the drilling
site. 
LAFORGE: Phaser modifications are online, sir. 
DATA: My calculations indicate
