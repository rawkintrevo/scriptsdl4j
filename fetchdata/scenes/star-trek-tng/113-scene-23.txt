RIKER LAFORGE TASHA PICARD WHALEN LEECH

[Hill's Waiting room]

PICARD [OC]: The holodeck makes excellent use of
finite space. 
(The group enter) 
LEECH: Ah, Mister Hill. You've been avoiding me. 
WHALEN: It's Felix Leech! It has to be. 
LEECH: You know me, sir? 
WHALEN: Well, I've read about you many times. 
PICARD: I'm very sorry, Mister Leech, but we have to be going. Call
again tomorrow. 
LEECH: You're being quite rude, Mister Hill. You haven't even
introduced me to your charming companions. 
PICARD: That'll have to wait. 
LEECH: But we have business! (pulls a gun) Urgent business. 
[Hill's office]

LEECH: You're not going anywhere. Not until we have
a little chat.

[Outside holodeck]

TASHA [OC]: Bridge to holodeck. We're approaching
the Jaradan sector. 
RIKER: Any word from the Jaradans? 
TASHA [OC]: Not a thing, sir. 
RIKER: They may be testing us. Seeing if we'll stick to the
arrangements. 
TASHA [OC]: What do we do now, sir? 
RIKER: We wait. 
LAFORGE: Well, everything checks out so far. Ensign Crusher believes
the trouble may have been caused by the Jaradan probe. If so, it could
be very difficult to locate.
