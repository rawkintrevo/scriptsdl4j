LAFORGE: Bridge, this is Engineering. 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: Now that we're out of warp, I'd like to use this time to make
some routine adjustments on the deuterium control conduit. We're
overdue.

[Bridge]

PICARD: How much time will these adjustments
require, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE [OC]: A couple of hours, sir. 
RIKER: Proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign.

LAFORGE: All right.

PICARD: Can you clean that up, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I'll try. Now. 
PICARD: This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat your
message? 
ANYA [OC]: I am Anya. Have you come for Salia of Daled Four? 
PICARD: That is correct. 
ANYA [OC]: What species are you? 
PICARD: Human. 
ANYA [OC]: Excellent. Bring us aboard. That is all. 
RIKER: Friendly, isn't she? 
PICARD: Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state, so we
will treat her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's go
greet our visitors. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
