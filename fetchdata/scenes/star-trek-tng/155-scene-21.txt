[Cave mouth]

(Geordi has found shelter at last, and can see a
blue coloured vertical jet emanating
from some way away) 
LAFORGE: A stationary neutrino source. Wesley Crusher. Thank you,
Wesley. 
(So he heads off towards it, and someone comes up behind him and knocks
him out. Another Romulan. When Geordi wakes up, his own phaser is being
pointed at him) 
BOCHRA: You are my prisoner. 
LAFORGE: Right. Congratulations. Surely a strategic triumph for the
Romulan Empire. 
BOCHRA: Stay there. 
LAFORGE: My shoes are getting full of sand. I just hate that, don't
you? 
BOCHRA: Name and rank. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge. I don't think I got
yours? 
BOCHRA: A Romulan ship will arrive shortly. You will accompany me on
board. 
LAFORGE: I don't think so. You see, we heard your message too and well,
the fleet's in, Commodore. Sky's full of Federation ships. 
BOCHRA: You're lying. 
LAFORGE: I never lie when I've got sand in my shoes, Commodore. 
BOCHRA: Get up. 
LAFORGE: Seriously, the only one way out of here is for you to put that
thing down and soon as there's a window in the storm 
(There's a rock fall, and Bochra gets hit badly. Geordi helps him up
and carries him into the nearest cave)

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Are you okay? 
(Bochra has hung onto the phaser, and points it at Geordi again) 
LAFORGE: You gotta be kidding. 
BOCHRA: Sit. 
LAFORGE: Welcome to Galorndon Core, where no good deed goes unpunished.

[Crusher's office]

WORF: Yes, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, good. Come in. Please sit down. We have finally
found a compatible ribosome match for the Romulan. But only one. You. 
WORF: That is impossible. I am a Klingon. 
CRUSHER: Different species, yes. But many humanoids have comparable
cell structures. And you have what this Romulan needs. There's
absolutely no risk to you. You did understand that was the purpose of
all the testing? 
WORF: I have no objection to tests. 
CRUSHER: You have an objection to being a donor? 
WORF: Yes. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant, I understand your feelings about the Romulans, but
this is not the time or place. 
WORF: If you had seen them kill your parents, you would understand,
Doctor, it is always the time and place for those feelings. 
CRUSHER: This Romulan didn't murder your parents. And you are the only
one who can save his life. 
WORF: Then he will die.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: I sure wish you'd put that away. 
BOCHRA: You're afraid of dying. 
LAFORGE: You bet I am. Who isn't? 
BOCHRA: I'm not. 
LAFORGE: Right. 
BOCHRA: To die in the service of my people. 
LAFORGE: Ah, the Romulan path to glory. 
BOCHRA: You can be sarcastic now, but in a few millennia, when humans
are extinct and the Romulan Empire spans the galaxy. 
LAFORGE: You really believe that stuff, don't you, Commodore? 
BOCHRA: You may address me as Centurion Bochra. 
LAFORGE: Bochra? Good, solid Romulan name. What's the matter? 
BOCHRA: Nothing. 
LAFORGE: Wrong. Your heart rate just shot way up. (taps the Visor) It
translates a wide range of radiation into neural impulses. Allows me to
see. 
BOCHRA: Without it, you're blind? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
BOCHRA: How did this happen? 
LAFORGE: I was born that way. 
BOCHRA: And your parents let you live? 
LAFORGE: What kind of question is that? Of course they let me live. 
BOCHRA: No wonder your race is weak. You waste time and resources on
defective children. 
LAFORGE: Whoa. I must be having some sort of polarity shift. The
diagnostic insists everything's fine. Hey, hey, your body temperature's
gone up another full point. 
BOCHRA: What are you saying? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. It must be this place, all that electromagnetic
soup, it's wreaking havoc on our nervous systems. Your metabolism's
messed up, so's my interface with the Visor. We've got to get out of
here while we still can. 
BOCHRA: Sit down. 
LAFORGE: Bochra 
BOCHRA: Sit down!

[Bridge]

(Riker is hanging over Wesley's shoulder) 
RIKER: What is that? 
WESLEY: It's just a background fluctuation, Commander. He hasn't found
it yet. 
RIKER: Then he must be hurt or dead. When does our next window open up,
Mister Data? 
DATA: There is no indication, Commander. I have no way to predict. 
WORF: Incoming Romulan transmission, Captain. 
RIKER: They're early. 
DATA: The Romulan warbird should still be twenty nine minutes away from
the edge of the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Close enough, however, to see we're not there. On screen. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Picard, I'm approaching the Federation border
and the Enterprise is not to be found. Why? 
PICARD: My away team is unable to leave the surface because of the
storms. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And my officer? 
PICARD: He is alive. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: His life remains in jeopardy? 
PICARD: Yes. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: And yet you will still not permit me to cross
into your precious Federation space to retrieve him? 
PICARD: If the point hasn't been made clearly, Commander, let me make
it again. Romulan warships do not enter Federation space unless they
are prepared to do battle. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: But a mission of mercy? 
PICARD: A mission to recover one of your officers who has been caught
on a Federation planet for reasons as yet unknown. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: I have already explained. 
PICARD: And I have rejected your explanation. 
TOMALAK [on viewscreen]: Territories! You would measure territories
against a man's life? 
PICARD: Commander, I am singularly impressed by your concern for a
life. Do not risk any more lives by leaving the Neutral Zone. Picard
out.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Bochra. Bochra, you're in bad shape and my
vision's getting worse. Now there's a beacon out there that'll get us
back to my ship, but not if I can't find it. 
BOCHRA: I cannot surrender to the Federation. 
LAFORGE: Then stay here and die. 
BOCHRA: If the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid
capture? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I might, if I thought it was necessary. If the
stakes were high enough. But they'd have to be pretty damn high. I
guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan, huh? 
BOCHRA: I no more wish to die than you do. 
LAFORGE: Bochra, there are times when it is necessary to die for one's
ideals. Do you believe this is one of those times? 
(Bochra puts down the phaser) 
LAFORGE: Come on. Let's go find that beacon. Whoa! 
BOCHRA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: Everything's gone blank. I'm blind.
