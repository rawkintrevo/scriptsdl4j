[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, hurry! 
HASKELL: Captain, it's almost gone.
(O'Brien gets them safely back and Riker hurried up to the Bridge)
RIKER: What the hell is going on? 
PICARD: Are you all right, Number One? 
RIKER: I've had it. Let's put all this technology to work, figure out
what's going on, and get the hell out of here. 
(After he's calmed down a little) 
RIKER: A ship that was almost the Yamato, existing in a hole in space,
with no crew aboard. Now what is the purpose? 
DATA: Add to it an attack by a nonexistent Romulan vessel. It does
suggest an interesting question. Was our away team actually over there?

RIKER: If we weren't over there, where the hell were we? 
HASKELL: Commander, I have re-established the star fix. 
RIKER: Great. Set course. Velocity warp two. 
HASKELL: Course and speed set. 
PICARD: Engage. 
DATA: I have lost contact, sir. 
PICARD: What? 
HASKELL: The star fix is gone. 
DATA: Captain, it is not in the same sector, but another opening has
appeared. 
PICARD: All right. Set a course for those stars, warp six. 
HASKELL: Yes, sir. Warp six. 
DATA: I've lost the signal, sir. 
RIKER: What's going on? 
PICARD: All stop. 
DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Data, I can see it. 
RIKER: This game is now wearing very thin. 
PICARD: Let's just hold this position. Counsellor? You have said you
sensed no intelligence in all of this. You haven't changed in that
belief? 
TROI: I'm not certain of that now, Captain. I do sense something
unusual. 
PICARD: Perhaps a different level of consciousness? 
TROI: Yes. Perhaps an intelligence so vast it eluded me. 
PULASKI: Rats in a maze. 
TROI: Exactly! 
PICARD: Explain. 
PULASKI: Everything we've been through reminds me of a laboratory
experiment. As if something was testing our responses to stimuli. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting that we're in some kind of laboratory? 
PULASKI: Yes. 
HASKELL: The opening seems closer, Captain. 
PICARD: I've had enough of being led about this way. 
RIKER: Agreed, Captain. Hold present position. 
TROI: Good. Don't satisfy its curiosity. 
(A face appears in the void) 
WORF: Captain, look. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Why are you so alarmed when I've gone to such
trouble to look just like you? 
DATA: Captain, sensors show nothing out there. Absolutely nothing. 
LAFORGE: Sure is a damned ugly nothing. 
PICARD: I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
representing a Federation of planets in this part of the galaxy. Can
you identify whoever or whatever you are? 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Nagilum. 
LAFORGE: Speaks right up for something your sensors say isn't there,
Data. 
PICARD: We still have no idea what you represent. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Data. 
DATA: Nagilum? 
NAGILUM: You are of different construction than the others.
Interesting. Picard, Riker, Geordi, Haskell. What are you? Your
construction also differs. 
(Pulaski is suddenly whipped around like a puppet on a string) 
PULASKI: My construction? 
DATA: Perhaps referring to your gender, Doctor? 
PULASKI: Yes, well, there are minor differences. I'm what we call a
female. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: I understand. The masculine and the feminine. 
PICARD: It is the way in which we propagate our species. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Please, demonstrate how this is accomplished. 
PULASKI: Not likely. 
PICARD: Whatever you are, your actions are not welcome. 
WORF: Let me put up the shields, sir. 
DATA: Sensors still show nothing out there. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: Your life form surprises me more and more. Is
it true you also have only a limited existence? Answer! 
PICARD: What information do you want? I don't understand the question. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: You exist and then you cease to exist. Your
minds call it death. 
(Haskell starts to shake, holds his head and screams before suffering
the fate usually reserved for red shirts) 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: How interesting. 
PULASKI: He's gone. 
PICARD: We cannot allow you to do that! We will fight you. 
NAGILUM [on viewscreen]: To understand death, I must amass information
on every aspect of it. Every kind of dying. The experiments shouldn't
take more than a third of your crew, maybe half.

Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7. It is obvious that
whatever we have met sees no value in our kind of life form. How do we
fight something that both is and is not there?

[Observation lounge]

TROI: I know this much. We are unimportant to it. 
WORF: In a battle for survival, Captain, thirty to fifty percent
casualties 
PULASKI: Would be appalling. 
WORF: But within acceptable limits. 
RIKER: This is not a battle, Worf. 
TROI: No. A laboratory experiment would be the closest comparison. 
PICARD: Is there any reason for not believing this Nagilum? 
TROI: No. 
DATA: All evidence indicates it is willing and able to do what it
proposes. 
PICARD: Agreed. Under the circumstances, I think there is only one
decision. I will not stand by while half of my crew is slaughtered. 
DATA: Sir. I do not believe there is anything you can do to prevent it.

PICARD: Yes, there is 
PULASKI: What? 
PICARD: Destroy the Enterprise. 
PULASKI: Isn't that a little like curing the disease by killing the
patient? 
RIKER: It's better than standing around helplessly. 
PULASKI: Why do get the feeling this was not the time to join this
ship?

[Engineering]

COMPUTER: Recognise, Picard Jean-Luc. Recognise
Riker, William T. 
PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct sequence. 
COMPUTER: Does Riker, William T. concur? 
RIKER: I do. Initiate auto-destruct sequence. 
COMPUTER: Desired time interval? 
PICARD: Stand by. Interesting question. How long to prepare to die? 
RIKER: What would be the least painful to our crew? Move to it quickly,
or allow them time to prepare for it thoroughly? Well, twenty minutes?
Nice round figure. 
PICARD: Initiate auto-destruct. Interval, twenty minutes. 
COMPUTER: Twenty minutes to auto-destruct. Nineteen minutes, fifty
seconds

[Picard's quarters]

(He's listening to tranquil piano music. Satie, Gymnopodie no 1)
PICARD: Come. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: Our destroying ourselves won't change its mind, Captain. I would
feel that. 
PICARD: You didn't mention you were that certain. 
TROI: I was wrong not to tell you, Captain. And your decision may also
be wrong. 
(Door bell) 
PICARD: Yes. Come in, please. 
(Data enters) 
DATA: I have a question, sir. 
PICARD: Yes, Data. What is it? 
DATA: What is death? 
PICARD: Oh, is that all? Well, Data, you're asking probably the most
difficult of all questions. Some see it as a changing into an
indestructible form, forever unchanging. They believe that the purpose
of the entire universe is to then maintain that form in an Earth-like
garden which will give delight and pleasure through all eternity. On
the other hand, there are those who hold to the idea of our blinking
into nothingness, with all our experiences, hopes and dreams merely a
delusion. 
DATA: Which do you believe, sir? 
PICARD: Considering the marvellous complexity of our universe, its
clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter,
energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must
be more than either of these philosophies. That what we are goes beyond
Euclidian and other practical measuring systems and that our existence
is part of a reality beyond what we understand now as reality. 
TROI: We should not let ourselves die, Jean-Luc. 
DATA: I agree with her, Jean-Luc. 
TROI: If only half of us live, then I'd rather take my chances on being
one that does. 
DATA: Yes. It is wrong of you to force us. 
TROI: It is wrong. 
PICARD: Yes. This is very wrong. Neither of you should be reacting in
this way. Computer, locate Commander Data for me. 
COMPUTER: Commander Data is on the Bridge. 
PICARD: It's not going to work, Nagilum. 
(Troi and Data vanish) 
DATA [OC]: Captain, we are clear. We are out of the void. 
RIKER [OC]: It's gone, Captain. We can abort the auto-destruct. 
PICARD: Hold, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: But Captain 
PICARD: Hold. 
[Bridge]

COMPUTER: One minute to auto-destruct. 
DATA: We are out of the void, sir. You may stop auto-destruct. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, any heading, warp six. Now! 
COMPUTER: Fifty seconds to auto-destruct. Forty seconds to
auto-destruct. 
RIKER: Captain? 
PICARD: It could all be part of the illusion. Commander Data, report. 
DATA: All navigational systems confirm we are at warp six on course,
sir. 
PICARD: Counsellor Troi? 
TROI: Captain, it has gone. I no longer feel its presence. 
COMPUTER: Twenty seconds to auto-destruct. Ten seconds to
auto-destruct. 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Abort auto-destruct sequence. 
COMPUTER: Riker, William T. Do you concur? 
RIKER: Yes! Absolutely! I do indeed concur wholeheartedly! 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct cancelled. 
(deep signs of relief all round) 
PICARD: A simple yes would have sufficed, Number One. 
RIKER: I didn't want there to be any chance of a misunderstanding. 
PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge. 
WESLEY: He sure held that bluff till the last second, didn't he, sir? 
RIKER: Was he bluffing?

[Ready room]

PICARD: Well, Nagilum, I hope you got what you
needed. 
NAGILUM [on monitor]: You have provided me with much more than I
needed. 
PICARD: Why did you release us? You could have seen the way we face
death. 
NAGILUM [on monitor]: It wasn't necessary. I have learned all I needed
to know. Would you like me to share some of my conclusions? 
PICARD: I'm not interested. 
NAGILUM [on monitor]: Of course you are. You are too inquisitive not to
want to know. You seem to find no tranquillity in anything. You
struggle against the inevitable. You thrive on conflict. You are
selfish, yet you value loyalty. You are rash, quick to judge, slow to
change. It's amazing you've survived. Be that as it may, as species, we
have no common ground. You are too aggressive. Too hostile. Too
militant. 
PICARD: During this period, you too have been evaluated. It would seem
that we have at least one thing in common. 
NAGILUM [on monitor]: Oh? 
PICARD: Curiosity. 
NAGILUM [on monitor]: The point is well taken, Captain. Perhaps that is
a trait we share. 
PICARD: Then perhaps we'll meet again. But next time, it will be out
here, among the stars.
