CRUSHER: Computer, access ship's medical logs and
download current autopsy files. 
COMPUTER: Autopsy files are restricted to active medical personnel
only. Access denied. 
CRUSHER: Damn. 
OGAWA: Doctor Crusher? What do you need the autopsy files for? 
CRUSHER: Don't worry. I know I'm not supposed to be here. I'll go. 
OGAWA: Computer, access autopsy files. 
OGAWA: I assume you'll need the files on Doctor Reyga and Jo'Bril? 
CRUSHER: Alyssa. 
OGAWA: I can see how important this is to you. 
CRUSHER: I don't want you to get involved in this. 
OGAWA: Is that an order, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
OGAWA: Too bad you're not my boss now. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. 
OGAWA: So what do we do now? 
CRUSHER: First of all, I want to review Jo'Bril's physiology records.
Then I want to take another look at the body. I want to see if there's
any tetryon traces. 
OGAWA: Let's do it.

(they get Jo'Bril out of storage) 
CRUSHER: We need to run a tissue scan at the molecular level. Calibrate
the scanner to pick up tetryon particles. 
OGAWA: Yes, Doctor. Re-calibration complete. 
CRUSHER: Activate the scan. 
OGAWA: Nothing. 
CRUSHER: Let's do it again. Use the enhanced resolution mode to boost
the sensitivity. 
OGAWA: There's something in the subdermal tissue. 
CRUSHER: Narrow the scan field. Tetryon traces. Someone did sabotage
the shield. 
OGAWA: That's a possibility, but this is very circumstantial evidence. 
CRUSHER: There's only one way to know for certain.

TROI: Captain, I'm concerned about Beverly. I've
tried several times to talk to her, but she's been avoiding me. 
PICARD: I'm not surprised. 
TROI: This entire experience has been 
DATA: Captain, an unscheduled launch is taking place in Shuttlebay two.

RIKER: No idea. No one's filed a flight plan. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(a shuttle takes off) 
RIKER: That's the Justman, the shuttle Reyga modified. 
PICARD: Open a hailing frequency. 
(Beverly's face on the viewscreen) 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher, what do you think you're doing? 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: Testing a theory, Captain. 
PICARD: A theory? 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: I think Doctor Reyga's shield does work. 
PICARD: Return to the ship immediately. 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: I'm sorry. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, override the shuttle's computer. Return it to the
shuttlebay. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Sir, she has isolated her navigational control. It will
not be possible to establish remote operation. 
RIKER: Get a tractor beam on her. 
WORF: I cannot establish a lock. She is too close to the star. Solar
interference is too high. 
PICARD: Mister Data, what is her heading? 
DATA: Bearing two seven one mark four, sir. She is headed into the
sun's corona. 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: Computer, begin monitoring external
temperature. 
COMPUTER: External temperature zero point eight million Kelvins and
rising. 
PICARD: Beverly, what do you hope to accomplish? 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: I think Doctor Reyga was right about his
shield. The only reason it failed is because it was sabotaged, and I'm
going to prove it. 
PICARD: But you can't be certain of that. You're betting your life on a
hypothesis. 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: I'm not wrong. 
COMPUTER: External temperature one point nine million Kelvins. 
DATA: Sir, the shuttle is entering the corona. 
PICARD: Beverly, what's happening? 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: I'm all right. Computer, shield status? 
COMPUTER: Metaphasic shield holding. All systems within normal
operating parameters. 
CRUSHER [on viewscreen]: Congratulations, Doctor Reyga. You did it.
Captain, I want you to post security guards around the three visiting
scientists. One of them has to be responsible for sabotaging the first
test. I think if we 
WORF: Sir, we have lost contact.
