TROI PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE

[Ten Forward]

(Riker and Troi are at a table) 
PICARD: Excuse me, am I interrupting? 
RIKER: No, not at all. Have a seat. 
PICARD: Thank you. I'd like to talk to you for a moment about my future
on the Enterprise. 
RIKER: Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc, isn't it? 
TROI: Maybe I should go. 
PICARD: No, please, Counsellor, I would very much like to hear your
thoughts. First of all, and I would like you to be absolutely
straightforward with me. How would you evaluate me as an officer? 
TROI: Well, er, your performance records have always been good. You're
thorough, dedicated. 
RIKER: Reliable, steady, (searching desperately) punctual. 
PICARD: I see. What would you say if I told you that I believed that I
was capable of being very much more. 
RIKER: Perhaps we should discuss this at your next evaluation. 
PICARD: I would appreciate it if we could discuss it now. You see, I
feel that I would like to move beyond astrophysics to Engineering or
Security, something that might even lead to Command. 
RIKER: Frankly, Lieutenant, I don't think that's realistic. 
PICARD: Why? 
TROI: I really don't think this is the place to be discussing this. 
PICARD: Please. This is important to me. I believe that I can do more. 
TROI: Hasn't that been the problem all along? Throughout your career
you've had lofty goals, but you've never been willing to do what's
necessary to attain them. 
PICARD: Would that be your evaluation as well, Commander? 
RIKER: I think I have to agree with the Counsellor. If you want to get
ahead, you have to take chances, stand out in a crowd, get noticed. 
PICARD: I see. 
RIKER: Now, we don't want to lose you. You're a very good officer. 
PICARD: Just not one who stands out. 
RIKER: Why don't I talk to Commander La Forge in Engineering and we'll
see what we can do. 
PICARD: But, Command? 
RIKER: Well, we'll see. 
DATA [OC]: Senior officers, please report to the Captain's Ready room. 
RIKER: Acknowledged. 
TROI: We should talk about this later. 
(Riker and Troi leave) 
PICARD: All right, Q, that's enough. You've made your point. Q? 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Lieutenant Picard. I'm still waiting for that
statistical analysis. 
PICARD: I'm on my way, sir.

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Main Engineering. Are you having a good
laugh now, Q? Does it amuse you to think of me living out the rest of
my life as a dreary man in a tedious job?
