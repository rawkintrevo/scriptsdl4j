[Observation lounge]

RIKER: We found the reason for the geological
instability. 
PICARD: Excellent. 
DAVIES: We would have missed it if Ensign Crusher hadn't requested an
ico-gram, but he did, and 
WESLEY: Drema Four has the largest deposit of dilithium ore ever
recorded. It's also laid down in a very unusual pattern. The crystals
are growing to form perfectly aligned lattices. 
HILDEBRANDT: The ore is forming generator strata. 
ALANS: Which creates a piezoelectric effect. 
PICARD: In plain English, you're saying the dilithium is causing the
geological catastrophe. 
ALANS: Right, the crystals take the natural radiant heat of the planet 
HILDEBRANDT: Focus it, and turn it into mechanical energy. 
ALANS: Which increases tectonic stresses 
HILDEBRANDT: That tear the planet apart. 
DAVIES: And then the crystals break down, which is why we found all
these traces of illium 629. 
PICARD: So that takes care of the why. Now, what can you do? 
WESLEY: That is going to take a little more work. 
PICARD: Can you reverse the process? 
WESLEY: We think so. 
PICARD: No. No theories, no half answers. Yes or no? 
HILDEBRANDT: We'll get to work on it. 
(Wesley and his team leave) 
RIKER: Sir, Data's out there right now, monitoring the conditions on
Drema Four. The situation's become pretty desperate for his
friend. He's calculated the safest location on the planet's surface.
You can guess why. 
PICARD: We're just keep getting deeper and deeper in, aren't we? 
RIKER: She's going to die. They're all going to die. 
PICARD: Unless. 
RIKER: Yes. Unless. 
PICARD: All right, you can tell Commander Data he has my permission to
contact his friend and conduct her to a safer location. Number One, you
know where we are now? 
RIKER: Sir? 
(Picard makes an 'up to our necks' gesture)

[Data's quarters]

DATA: Sarjenka, this is Data. Respond please. 
COMPUTER: Unable to complete transmission. 
DATA: Reason for failure? 
COMPUTER: Atmospheric activity interfering with RF signal.

[Ready room]

WORF: We're modifying class one probes so they
become resonators. We will then use torpedo casings to protect them
once they begin burrowing beneath the surface. 
PICARD: How will these resonators destroy the crystals? 
HILDEBRANDT: By emitting harmonic vibrations which will shatter the
lattices. 
WORF: The Enterprise will monitor and adjust the frequency of the
resonators. 
RIKER: Sounds like a plan. Lets get started. 
(Worf and Hildebrandt leave. Data enters) 
DATA: Captain. 
PICARD: Tea, Earl Grey, hot. 
DATA: Captain, permission to beam down to Drema Four. 
PICARD: What? 
DATA: I have been unable to contact Sarjenka. 
PICARD: Data, I appreciate your concern. Transporting to the surface is
only going to make a bad situation worse. 
DATA: Sir, I feel it is important to determine the reason for 
RIKER: Come on, Data. 
DATA: Captain, your orders were to deliver the message, correct? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA: Then what is the difference between sending the message and
delivering it personally? 
RIKER: A whopping big one, and you know it. 
DATA: Sir, we have come this far. 
PICARD: In for a penny, in for a pound, is that what you're saying,
Mister Data? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Oh, hell. Go. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Number One, handle the transporter. Go. 
RIKER: Where would you say we are now, sir? 
(In over their heads) 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't see any of
this. You're not involved. 
O'BRIEN: Right, sir. I'll just standing over here, dozing off. 
RIKER: Data, you've got ten minutes. That's it. If you meet anybody but
Sarjenka 
DATA: I will signal for immediate beam out. 
(Data is beamed down) 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker to the Bridge. 
RIKER: Damn. 
O'BRIEN: I just woke up, sir. 
RIKER: You know what to do? 
O'BRIEN: No problem, sir. I'll have him out of there as smooth as ice.
