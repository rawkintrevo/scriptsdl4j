[Cargo bay]

PICARD [OC]: Thirty seven through thirty nine. 
WORF: Aye, sir. I'll also cover the photon torpedo launchers. Danar may
attempt to leave the ship that way. Worf out. 
(But Danar is hiding behind some cargo, not wearing the pressure suit.
When he hears the doors closing, he comes out and doesn't see Worf
hiding) 
WORF: Danar! You are cunning. You must have Klingon blood. But the
battle is over. 
ROGA: My battle is never over. 
WORF: Worf to Bridge. I have Danar. 
(The hidden phaser explodes, the lights go out, and Danar jumps Worf) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Explosion in Jefferies tube section T nine
five. All external sensors inoperative. 
RIKER: Go to backup systems. 
DATA: Unable to transfer control, sir.

[Cargo bay]

(Danar finally defeats Worf by toppling a lot of
cargo boxes on top of him. Then he beams himself onto the transport
ship) 
[Transport ship]

ROGA: Sit down, gentlemen.

[Cargo bay]

WORF: Worf to Bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead. 
WORF: Danar has escaped. 
[Bridge]

WORF [OC]: He used a phaser to power the cargo
transporter. Coordinates indicate he beamed aboard the Angosian
transport ship.
PICARD: Data, can you verify that? 
DATA: Negative, sir. All external sensors still nonfunctioning. 
PICARD: Then we have no way to track him. 
RIKER: That was his plan all along.

First officer's log, supplemental. We are
continuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escape
of the Angosian prisoner, Danar. He is still at large.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Engineering, I'm getting readings on
Tactical. Are we back up? 
LAFORGE [OC]: That's affirmative, Commander. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, sweep the area. 
DATA: Captain, the Prime Minister is hailing us. Priority one. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: Priority channel cleared. 
PICARD: Yes, Prime Minister? 
NAYROK [on viewscreen]: Captain, I've just been informed that Roga
Danar has attacked the penal colony on Lunar Five. 
PICARD: Attacked it ? 
NAYROK [on viewscreen]: In our own police shuttle. Several of my people
have been wounded. Hundreds of prisoners are rioting. Some of them have
escaped with Danar and at last report are headed to the capital city.
Captain, we are not suited to handle situations like this. That's what
we created them for. 
PICARD: I'll send an away team, Prime Minister. Picard out. Counsellor
Troi, Commander Data, Mister Worf, you will accompany me to the planet.

[Corridor]

PICARD: And my understanding is these men are
programmed to survive. Is that correct? 
TROI: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: And that they will not kill unless their survival is at stake? 
DATA: It is against their nature to do so, Captain. 
PICARD: Then let us hope they do not believe their survival is at
stake. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, you are personally responsible for the Captain's
safety. 
WORF: I understand, Commander.
