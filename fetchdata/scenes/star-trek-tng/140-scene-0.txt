WESLEY [OC] PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE
boarding level agreed wrong discrepancy readout say isn mission

[Engineering]

DATA: I would consider them insignificant. 
RIKER: What if you're wrong? Sorry. But what if it is more than a mere
discrepancy? 
LAFORGE: Then I'd say we have a problem. 
PICARD: Agreed. We'll have Starbase Montgomery give us an independent
reading. 
DATA: Even if the molecular level controls have failed, we can still
recrystallise the dilithium without outside help. 
LAFORGE: Don't worry, Data. My ego isn't at stake here. 
DATA: Perhaps we can reprogram the system to correct the readout
variables 
PICARD: Well, that's certainly another option, but as we're stopping at
Starbase Montgomery anyway, we'll let them do the analysis. 
RIKER: I don't recall Starbase Montgomery on the mission itinerary 
PICARD: I think we could all use a twelve hour layover. Besides, I've
just received some personnel transfer directives. Priority matter, 
RIKER: Boarding or disembarking? 
WESLEY [OC]: Captain Picard. We're within hailing range of Starbase
Montgomery 
PICARD: Go to half impulse power. (to Riker) Will you join me in the
Observation lounge when you're done?
