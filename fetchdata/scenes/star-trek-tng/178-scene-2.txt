woman appear proudest son chief chat signalled fine women

[Transporter room]

WORF: They still have not signalled? 
O'BRIEN: No sir. 
WORF: My mother is never on time. It is so human of her. 
O'BRIEN: Well, you know women. 
WORF: I am not looking forward to this. I wish they would come so it
would begin and end sooner. 
O'BRIEN: I know what you mean, Lieutenant. 
WORF: Unlikely. 
O'BRIEN: Last time my old man was on board I found him chasing Nurse
Stanton around a biobed in Sickbay. 
WORF: I am not concerned about my father chasing nurses. 
O'BRIEN: Yeah, but it's always something with parents, isn't it. 
FEMALE [OC]: Enterprise, this is Earth Station Bobruisk. Two to
transport aboard. 
O'BRIEN: Energising. 
(A big, stocky silver-haired man, and a mature woman with lots of brown
hair appear) 
WORF: Mother. Father. 
HELENA: Worf! 
SERGEY: You look good, son. Put on a little weight, huh? 
WORF: No. 
SERGEY: Sure you have. Looks good on you. Still working out with those
Holodeck monsters, I bet. 
WORF: Let me take you to 
SERGEY: Always good to meet another Chief Petty Officer. Sergey
Rozhenko, formerly of the USS Intrepid. 
(shakes hands) 
O'BRIEN: Miles Edward O'Brien, sir. Good to meet you. 
SERGEY: Don't call me sir. I used to work for a living. 
HELENA: He's joking. The proudest day of his life was when Worf earned
his commission. 
SERGEY: Can you imagine an old enlisted man like me raising a boy to be
an officer? 
HELENA: Come on, Sergey. There's plenty of time to chat with the boys.
Your father has been so looking forward to this. 
SERGEY: Yes, I want to see everything. The whole ship. At home I have
all the specs and diagrams of the Galaxy-class starships. 
WORF: We are in the midst of a repair. I cannot give you a complete
tour. 
SERGEY: I'm sure if you asked the Captain 
HELENA: You agreed not to embarrass him. Besides, we have come to see
Worf, not the ship. 
SERGEY: Fine. Fine. Okay. 
HELENA: Your hair's a little longer, isn't it, Worf?
