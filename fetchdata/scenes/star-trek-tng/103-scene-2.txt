[Tsiolkovsky]

(The group beam into an area with scattered
furniture and a Red Alert) 
RIKER: Cover the ship as planned. Move out. 
DATA: Indications of what humans would call a wild party? 
(They find a monitor, with a static laden image) 
RIKER: Their Bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record everything.

(The picture gets cleaned up) 
RIKER: You were right. Somebody blew the hatch. They were all sucked
out into space. 
DATA: Correction, sir, that's blown out. 
RIKER: Thank you, Data. 
DATA: A common mistake, sir, 
TASHA [OC]: Commander Riker, Lieutenant Yar. Location Engineering. Ten
people here, sir, all frozen. No vital signs. 
RIKER: Frozen? How? 
TASHA [OC]: It looks like someone has been playing with the
environmental controls, sir. Just let all the heat bleed away into
space. 

[Tsiolkovsky Crew Quarters]

(Another group of frozen people just lounging
about. Some are in a state of undress) 
LAFORGE: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge in the crew quarters. Something in
here. 
(He finds a door which is trying to close. He opens it and a corpse
falls out into his arms.
