LAFORGE: All the engines check out perfectly,
Commander. Once we get them started, the Brittain can get back to
Starbase under her own power. 
RIKER: Let's give it a try. 
LAFORGE: Pre-heating injectors. Data, fuel flow? 
DATA: Matter valves are open and operating. Magnetic containment of
antimatter pods is constant. 
LAFORGE: Okay, open injectors. 
DATA: Injectors open. There is no engine activity at all, sir. 
RIKER: What's wrong? 
LAFORGE: Nothing's wrong. I don't understand it.

PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: I've been studying the autopsy reports. The conclusion is
appalling. There was no outside source, no alien presence. All thirty
four of them appear to have killed each other. 
PICARD: What could have caused such an event? Drugs? A virus? Poison? 
CRUSHER: Toxicological tests showed no unusual substances in their
systems, and they all appear to be in good health. But for whatever
reason, they seemed to turn against each other, using phasers and
knives and bare hands. I'd like you to see this, Captain. It's from the
logs of the Brittain. Captain Zaheva's mental condition deteriorated
steadily once they'd became stranded. She began talking of plots and
mutinies. This was the last entry log, made after they had been adrift
for over three weeks. 
ZAHEVA [on monitor]: First Officer Brink and his men were behind it.
They got to the engines. They don't work anymore. Had to eliminate
Brink. the ship is out of, out of, we're running out. Too dangerous!
Out of Brink! And his men!
