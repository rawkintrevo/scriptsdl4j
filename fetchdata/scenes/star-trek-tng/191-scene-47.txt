DATA: We have only enough power to emit a hydrogen
stream for that amount of time. They must understand that they will
have to detonate it immediately. Captain, we are ready to implement the
plan. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
DATA: We will have to draw power from the life-support systems in order
to discharge the collectors. This is Acting Captain Data. All personnel
will report to designated shelter areas

[Ten Forward]

DATA [OC]: Immediately. Life support systems will
continue only in emergency shelter areas. 
GILLESPIE: Hear that? Get us jammed into shelter areas. We sit and wait
to die. Nobody'll ever find us. 
GUINAN: Relax, Gillespie. Everybody relax. Ten Forward is a designated
shelter area. Relax. 
GILLESPIE: Do we want to die here like helpless children? 
GUINAN: Security to Ten Forward immediately. 
GILLESPIE: We don't even know what we're dying for. 
O'BRIEN: Sit down, Gillespie. You're not helping matters any. 
GILLESPIE: What's wrong with standing up for ourselves? 
(Security arrive) 
GILLESPIE: Picard owes us some answers. 
(Gillespie thumps O'Brien, the security men join in and there's a
brawl. Guinan gets a Big Gun from behind the bar and fires at the
ceiling)
GILLESPIE: What is that? 
GUINAN: It's a little souvenir I picked up on Magus Three. That was
setting number one. Anyone want to see setting number two?
