(an alien humanoid is giving a presentation) 
JA'DAR: Twenty three field coils, working in concert, will generate the
soliton wave from this point on the planet surface.
We will have our test ship towed to a position approximately two
million kilometres from Bilana Three. If our theories are correct, the
wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp. 
PICARD: Warp without warp drive. 
RIKER: They're going to put you out of a job, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: I hope so, Commander. 
DATA: Doctor Ja'Dar, how closely will the Enterprise need to follow the
test vehicle? 
JA'DAR: The soliton emits a great deal of subspace radio interference.
You'll need to remain within twenty kilometres in order to receive
telemetry. 
PICARD: Doctor, how will you end the experiment? 
JA'DAR: The wave will be directed toward Lemma Two, about three light
years distance. Our sister facility there which will generate a
scattering field which will dissipate the wave and bring the ship out
of warp. I'll be sending you more detailed operational plans within the
hour. 
PICARD: Very well, Doctor. We'll contact you again once we've finished
studying the mission specs.

TROI: Worf. I was just talking with Mrs. Kyle the
primary school teacher. She told me you enrolled Alexander in her class
this morning. 
WORF: Yes. 
TROI: I'm sure he'll do very well. She's a wonderful teacher. 
WORF: Good. 
TROI: Did she tell you about the father-son field trip this afternoon? 
WORF: Yes. We cannot attend. 
TROI: Why not? 
WORF: I have a personnel review scheduled at thirteen hundred hours. 
TROI: This would be a good opportunity for you to meet some of the
other students and parents. 
WORF: I might be able to reschedule the review. 
TROI: Good. I'll let them know you're coming.
