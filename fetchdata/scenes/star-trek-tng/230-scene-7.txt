LAFORGE: I want you to shut down the warp engines
and recalibrate the aft sensors while I work on the lateral array. 
BARTEL: Aye, sir. 
BARTEL [OC]: Can I help you, sir? 
SCOTT [OC]: Oh, I don't think so, lassie, but I'll let you know if you
can. 
BARTEL [OC]: Sir, this area is restricted to authorised personnel 
LAFORGE: Bartel, it's okay. I'll handle it. Captain Scott, this really
isn't 
SCOTT: We're in Engineering. Call me Scotty. 
LAFORGE: Scotty, this really isn't a good time for a tour. We're
running a phase seven survey of the Dyson Sphere. 
SCOTT: I'm not here for a tour, laddie. I'm here to help. 
LAFORGE: That's very kind, but I'm sure we can handle it. 
SCOTT: I was a Starfleet engineer for fifty two years, Mister La Forge.
I think I'm still useful. 
LAFORGE: You're right. We'd be grateful for any help you can give us. 
SCOTT: Good. Let's get to work.

DATA: Sensor readings indicate the presence of a
G-type star at the centre of the sphere. There also appears to be a
class-M atmosphere clinging to the interior surface. 
PICARD: Is there any indication that the sphere is inhabited? 
DATA: Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary data suggests it is still
capable of supporting life. We have been unable to find definite signs
of current habitation. 
PICARD: Mister Data, send out a series of class-four probes to survey
the far side of the sphere. Perhaps we'll have more luck with them. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
