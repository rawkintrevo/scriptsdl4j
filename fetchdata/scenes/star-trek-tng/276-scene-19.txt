PICARD RO DATA KALITA WORF

[Ro's ship]

KALITA: They're scanning our last position. 
RO: All right, I've locked onto their sensor beam. I'm going to use it
to manoeuvre into transporter range. 
KALITA: How are we going to beam through their shields? 
RO: We can't. If we're going to get those medical supplies, we're going
to have to take this ship through their shields.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which the
distress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. 
WORF: Captain, the computer has detected a piggyback communication on
the last distress signal. 
PICARD: Can you decode it? 
WORF: It will take a few moments. 
PICARD: Do it.

[Ro's ship]

RO: The Enterprise shields have a weak point. When
the ship is at impulse, the thrust destabilises the shield
configuration right at this point. (between the nacelles) I'm going to
try to punch through there. 
KALITA: Won't they detect us? 
RO: They'll know something's penetrated the shields. With all the
interference it'll take them a few seconds to find us. We'll have to
beam the medical supplies aboard and get out fast. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The message is difficult to decode.
Interference has garbled much of the transmission, but it seems to be
from Lieutenant Ro. 
PICARD: Ro is on that ship? 
DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft
shields. 
PICARD: Let it through.
