CREWWOMAN WORF LAFORGE CREWMAN

  [Cargo
bay]

LAFORGE: No question about it. She was bluffing,
Worf. 
WORF: Bluffing is not one of Counsellor Troi's strong suits. 
LAFORGE: I'm still reading some chlorinide leakage, but I can't pin it
down. 
LAFORGE: Maybe up here. 
(Geordi goes up a ladder to scan some barrels on a shelf) 
WORF: It would have been unwise to call. Yes. My hand was not strong
enough. 
LAFORGE: You had jacks and eights, she bluffed you with a pair of
sixes. 
WORF: How did you know what I had? 
LAFORGE: Let's just say I had a special insight into the cards. Maybe
next time you should bring a deck that's not transparent to infrared
light. Not to worry, Worf. I only peek after the hand is over. Still
nothing. I'll get a dynoscan. We'll try again. 
CREWMAN: Commander, is that what you wanted? 
LAFORGE: Yes. If anything changes, you let me know. Ensign, run a
dynoscan. 
(Worf carries on scanning with the tricorder, as a barrel stacked on
top of the leaking one starts to topple forward until) 
CREWWOMAN: Look out! 
(a barrel thumps Worf right on the spine) 
LAFORGE: Worf! 
CREWMAN: Commander, what happened? 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Sickbay! Medical emergency in cargo bay three!
