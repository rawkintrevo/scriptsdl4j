TROI: Mother, how much 
LWAXANA [OC]: Little one, why do you refuse to use telepathy even when
we are alone? 
TROI: We're not alone, Mother. Now how much longer is this going to

LWAXANA [OC]: I am a woman dressing for a man. Something you might try
now and then, dear. I wonder if Timicin likes green. 
TROI: That's not very telepathic of you. 
LWAXANA: Oh, I tried telepathy on him. He's the wrong species. Right
species for everything else, though. You might try that once in a
while, too. 
TROI: You know, you're not just incorrigible, you're insatiable.
