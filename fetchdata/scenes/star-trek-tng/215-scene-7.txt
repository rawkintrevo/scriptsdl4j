[Bridge]

RO: The shuttle has crashed on the surface. 
PICARD: Do we have their position? 
WORF: I am picking up the shuttle's trace signature, but the surface
interference is distorting its position. 
PICARD: Can you locate them? 
RO: I think I can. I followed their entry almost all the way in. We can
calculate the coordinates from the angle of descent. 
[Moon surface]

(an explosive charge blows off the rear emergency
hatch) 
TROI: Your arm. 
RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? 
DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communication
with the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. 
RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take an
inventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that's
usable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believe
it's even less likely there's anyone living here. 
DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have not
been damaged by our landing, sir. 
TROI: What is that? 
RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. 
DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across the
spectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. 
TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now than
ever. 
RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll find
them. 
TROI: They're coming. They're coming with the storm. 
[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: We can't get a pattern lock on their
communicators because of the EM bursts, Captain. There's no way we can
beam them out of there, not under these conditions. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: The same conditions won't permit a shuttle
to land safely, Mister LaForge. Any suggestions? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Give us a minute, Captain.
