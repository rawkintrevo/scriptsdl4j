PICARD: Would you object to your Captain ordering a
clearly illegal kidnapping? 
[Bandi city]

RIKER: No objection, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Groppler Zorn may have the answers we need.
Get him. Bring him here. 
[Bandi city]

RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: They're forcing a difficult decision on me,
Counsellor. 
TROI: But I doubt protecting the Bandi would violate the Prime
Directive. True, they are not actual allies, but 
PICARD: We are in the midst of diplomatic discussions with them.
Lieutenant, lock phasers on that vessel. 
TASHA: Phasers locked on, Captain. 
(There's a flash, and the Judge Q stands there) 
Q: Typical. So typical. Savage lifeforms never follow even their own
rules. 
PICARD: Get off my bridge! 
Q: Interesting, that order about phasers. 
TASHA: Standing by on phasers, Captain. 
Q: Please, don't let me interfere. Use your weapons. 
PICARD: We've no idea who is on that vessel. My order was a routine
safety precaution. 
Q: Really? No idea of what it represents? The meaning of that vessel is
as plain, as plain as the noses on your ugly little primate faces. And
if you were truly civilised, Captain, wouldn't you be doing something
about the casualties happening down there? 
PICARD: Captain to CMO. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD [OC]: Are you reading any of this? 
CRUSHER: Medical teams already preparing to beam down, Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Compliments on that, Doctor. Any questions?
Starfleet people are trained to render aid and assistance whenever 
Q: But not trained in clear thinking. 
PICARD: Let's consider your thoughts. You call us savages and yet you
knew those people down there would be killed. It is your conduct that
is uncivilised. 
WORF: Sir, they're firing on the planet again. 
PICARD: Go to manoeuvring jets. Position us between that vessel and the
planet. Force fields full on. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Impulse power to (beep) We have no ship control, sir.
It's gone!

He is covered in dust)

RIKER: Yes. You?
