TROI CRUSHER PICARD RIKER OBRIEN RO DATA

[Sickbay]

(Troi wakes with a scream) 
CRUSHER: Easy, Deanna. 
TROI: Where? 
CRUSHER: Back on the Enterprise. You're going to be okay. 
TROI: My skin, it's tingling. 
CRUSHER: You're experiencing the afterimages of the electromagnetic
discharge. The sensation will pass. They're all fine, too. Now, I want
you to take your time, Counsellor. Doctor's orders. 
(Picard enters) 
PICARD: Injury report, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Mostly minor abrasions. Commander Riker took the worst of it
with a broken arm.
PICARD: Mister Data. Good work, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: Thank you, sir. 
RIKER: Ready for duty, sir. 
PICARD: You're sure, Number One? 
RIKER: It's not the first bone I've ever broken. 
PICARD: And how are you, Counsellor? 
TROI: Very glad to be here. 
PICARD: Good. Let's go. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: So what happened down there? 
RIKER: It was just one hell of a storm. It moved in on our position
faster than anything I've ever seen. 
PICARD: Was there any evidence of life? 
[Turbolift]

RIKER: No, but if Troi was right, we were very
close to it. 
PICARD: Bridge. How do you suggest we proceed? 
RIKER: We need to adjust the scanners so they can penetrate those
storms. Do you have any ideas, Data? 
DATA: We might be able to employ virtual imaging to interpolate
(metallic sound) missing data. 
PICARD: Is something wrong, Commander?

DATA: My apologies. It seems my primary speech processors are
experiencing a minor fluctuation. I will have it corrected in a moment.

[Bridge]

TROI: Captain, may I speak with you a moment in
private? 
PICARD: Of course. You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Mister Data, deploy sensor scans when you're ready. Ensign, take
us to a synchronous orbit aligned around our crash site. 
(Picard and Troi leave) 
RO: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Sir, given the EM field properties of this moon, I recommend a
search pattern beginning in the southern polar region. 
RIKER: The polar region? That would be starting from scratch, Mister
Data. Our latest
readings would suggest that we begin our scan around our crash site. 
DATA: The Essex signal was never clearly located, sir. A systematic
survey of the moon from a polar orbit might be more practical. 
RIKER: Well, you might be right, but I'd like to give the crash site a
once over first. Maintain our current orbit. 
DATA: Understood, sir.

[Ready room]

TROI: I've never felt anything like it. It was as
though they were calling to me. 
PICARD: Are you saying someone was communicating telepathically? 
TROI: Perhaps, for an instant. It was like their voices were being
carried on the wind. 
PICARD: What were they trying to communicate? 
TROI: I'm not sure, but they were calling me to the southern polar
region. I believe that's where we should look for the Essex.
