CRUSHER [OC]: Once it's out of our people. 
LAFORGE: You should be able to do that by flooding Ten Forward with
ionogenic particles. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Exactly what I was thinking. 
RIKER [OC]: Geordi, how long will it take to get it all ready? 
LAFORGE: We still have to calibrate the plasma inverter, Commander. My
guess is forty five minutes to an hour. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: I can have the containment field ready by
then. 
RIKER: Keep me advised.

[Ten Forward]

PICARD: Impressions, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Spiritual possessions of this sort have been reported throughout
Klingon history. It is called jat'yIn, the taking of the living by the
dead. 
PICARD: Human history is full of many similar legends. 
WORF: Then you believe they may be telling the truth? 
PICARD: Not for one moment. 
WORF: Sir, they know much about the Essex. If it is the spirit of
Captain Shumar. 
PICARD: Then he should be behaving very much better, don't you think? A
Starfleet Captain. 
O'BRIEN: You two, sit down. 
WORF: After living disembodied for two centuries, perhaps they've gone
mad. 
PICARD: I assure you, Mister Worf, these are not jat'yIn. Our job is to
find out exactly what they are and then to determine how to deal with
them. 
(Data comes over and separates them) 
DATA: Right, That's enough. Sit down, both of you. You over there, you
there. Down. 
O'BRIEN: I gave you that. In a place called McKinley Park. Green grass.
Tall trees. 
KEIKO: Please don't. 
O'BRIEN: I hid the bracelet in your pocket. You were surprised. 
KEIKO: Don't. 
O'BRIEN: You said, Miles, you make me feel so happy. 
(He leans in to kiss her) 
KEIKO: No! Get away! Get away from me. 
TROI: Leave her alone. 
PICARD: Captain Shumar. We'll be approaching the southern polar region
that you requested in a few minutes. I need to give additional
instructions. 
TROI: Very well. We're taking you to our crash site. 
PICARD: The southern pole? 
TROI: That is correct. 
PICARD: Nothing our sensors were able to detect indicated that the
Essex went down in that region. 
TROI: As I told you, Captain, the ship broke up in the atmosphere, and
the bridge went down here. When we reach it, you will beam what's left
of our skeletal remains on board this ship and then take them back to
Earth for a proper burial. You see how simple a request this is? 
PICARD: Captain, if you will let these people go, I'll order the Bridge
to follow your instructions. 
TROI: I will release no one. 
PICARD: If you are who you say you are, there's no need for any of
this. We'll gladly take you home. 
TROI: I wish you were truly as open-minded as you say, Picard. 
PICARD: If you don't release the hostages, I won't cooperate. 
DATA: You will cooperate, Captain. You will cooperate or someone will
die. Who shall it be? How about the Klingon? Get another one. 
O'BRIEN: You. 
(Another woman takes Molly) 
O'BRIEN: Come on. Come on, come on. 
DATA: Pick one to die, Captain, or I kill them both.
