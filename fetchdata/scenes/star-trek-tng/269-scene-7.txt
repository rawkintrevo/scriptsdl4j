[Ready room]

(there is a collection of new artefacts on Picard's
desk) 
PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: Captain? 
PICARD: Yes, come in, Number One. 
RIKER: We've confined the system corruption. It won't be spreading any
further. But we still have alien symbols floating around on our
computer. This is quite a collection you've assembled. I've seen these
things all over the ship. They all look the same. Primitive and
non-functional. 
PICARD: Ceremonial, and deceptively primitive. Only an advanced
technological society could have built that object out there. These
artefacts played a ritualistic role in that society, I think. 
RIKER: Do you think Data could be right? Could we have stumbled across
some sort of alien library? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, it's possible. And if so, this is a find of most
enormous significance. That library seems designed to do so much more
than simply store information. Who knows what we might learn from this?

RIKER: I keep seeing this design. 
PICARD: Yes, this symbol seems to be of particular significance. 
RIKER: What do you think it means? 
PICARD: The concept of the four cardinal compass directions is quite
common in many different cultures. 
RIKER: The words that Data recognised in the computer, boundary,
border, road, they were all arranged in this design. 
PICARD: Well, perhaps the artefacts that all have this compass symbol
belong to the same theme, movement. Finding a direction, travelling a
path, crossing a boundary. 
RIKER: And death? One of the symbols was death. 
PICARD: The ultimate boundary. 
PICARD: I've seen this symbol everywhere too, but much less prominently
displayed. It's always in the background, smaller than the others. 
(a straight line with a hemisphere below it showing a semicircle with
radiant lines - half a sun? ) 
RIKER: What do you think it represents? 
PICARD: I have no idea.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lower synaptic functions are completely
normal. Autonomous systems all check out. 
DATA: I suggest we examine the memory subsystem next. 
LAFORGE: All right. (Data twitches) Data, what's wrong? 
DATA: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation. 
LAFORGE: Well, what is it? 
DATA: An impulse. 
LAFORGE: Impulse? What kind of impulse? 
DATA: I do not know. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to check out your higher functions. 
DATA: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? 
LAFORGE: Data, come on, you're scaring me now. What's going on? 
DATA: I do not know. I am different. 
LAFORGE: Well, you're going to be all right. You're with me, okay? 
DATA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Listen, I'm going to disconnect you. (does so) What's going
on? 
(Data's circuitry has changed) 
LAFORGE: Data. 
(Data has the compass symbol on his forehead and a wicked grin) 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking. 
(after the break, Data is sitting on the warp core as Picard enters.
There is a symbol on his chest.) 
LAFORGE: Captain 
DATA-IHAT: Captain. I've been waiting for you. You should feel
honoured. I don't usually wait for anyone. 
PICARD: What is it you want? 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking. 
PICARD: Are you Masaka? 
DATA-IHAT: I am not Masaka. I am Ihat. 
PICARD: What have you done to Commander Data? 
DATA-IHAT: Commander Data? You mean the one who was here? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA-IHAT: He's gone. Who can say where? 
PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering
immediately. 
DATA-IHAT: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering
immediately. 
PICARD: Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive of
your species? 
DATA-IHAT: I come from Masaka's city. 
PICARD: Are there others like you there? 
(Data goes to lie on the 'pool table') 
DATA-IHAT: There are no others like me. 
PICARD: Who is Masaka? 
DATA-IHAT: You will find out. 
PICARD: I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. 
DATA-IHAT: Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know
of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds
you. It can be done. I did it. 
(Troi enters) 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka. 
(Data kneels before her in fear, and when he looks up again, there is a
different symbol on his chest) 
DATA-VICTIM: I am yours. Every part of me is yours. 
PICARD: We should confine him to quarters.
