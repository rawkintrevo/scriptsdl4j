TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

 [Observation lounge]

RIKER: The Fleming's last contact with Starfleet
was four days ago. According to them, there was nothing out of the
ordinary when they entered the Corridor. 
PICARD: Data. 
(Data explains the wall monitor display) 
DATA: The unusually intense tetryon fields in this sector pose a severe
navigational hazard to
warp driven vessels. The Hekaras Corridor is the only route through the
area which is free of tetryon fields. Ships travelling at warp must use
the Corridor to ensure safe passage through the region. 
PICARD: How long will it take to complete a level one search? 
DATA: At least two days, sir. The Corridor is over twelve light years
long, and the surrounding tetryon interference will limit our sensor
range. 
WORF: Could we send out reconnaissance probes to supplement the
sensors? 
LAFORGE: They won't be very effective. The interference will make it
difficult to maintain contact with the probes. The best we can do is to
increase sensor efficiency. We've installed multiphase buffers on all
the sensor modules, Captain. It should help a little. 
TROI: Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't it? Maybe they've had contact
with the Fleming. 
RIKER: They haven't. I've already spoken to the Hekaran government.
According to them, only one ship has passed through the system in the
last week. It was a Ferengi trader. 
CRUSHER: The Fleming was carrying a supply of rare biomimetic gel,
which is very valuable. Is it possible that the Ferengi might have
hijacked it? 
RIKER: I wouldn't put it past them. I think we should prepare for that
contingency. 
PICARD: I agreed. All right then. Mister Worf, initiate your search
pattern. Let's head in.
