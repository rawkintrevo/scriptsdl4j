HUBBLE PICARD RIKER LAFORGE WORF

[Cavern]

(They beam into a place of extraordinary
stalagmites and a wonderfully flat floor) 
LAFORGE: I'm detecting high levels of volcanic gases. Sulphur dioxide,
methane, hydrogen sulphide. 
RIKER: Toxic? 
LAFORGE: We're okay for now, but I wouldn't want to spend my vacation
here. 
RIKER: What about energy readings? 
WORF: Magnetic clutter is increasing. I cannot make an accurate
determination. 
LAFORGE: Same here, Commander. I'm getting a lot of confusing readings
here, 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker, please acknowledge. 
RIKER: Riker here.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: We're having trouble reading you. 
PICARD: And we are having similar difficulties reading you. I am
advising you and your away team

[Cavern]

PICARD [OC]: to transport up at once. 
LAFORGE: That's good advice, Commander. We've got a sudden build up of
gases here, especially methane. 
RIKER: Transporter Room. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: Take us up. 
HUBBLE: I can't get a solid lock on you, sir. Too much interference.

[Cavern]

HUBBLE [OC]: I'm trying again.
