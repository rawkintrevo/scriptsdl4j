RIKER CRUSHER WORF PICARD JOHN DATA TEMPLE

[Ten Forward]

JOHN: This ship is astounding. It seems to stretch
on without end. 
CRUSHER: We can see the rest of it some other time. This is your first
day out of Sickbay and I don't want you to overexert yourself. 
JOHN: This looks like an ideal place to rest. 
CRUSHER: My thoughts exactly. 
JOHN: Truly remarkable. 
CRUSHER: What is? 
JOHN: These people. They're all so different from one another yet they
work together freely. 
CRUSHER: That surprises you? 
JOHN: It is new to me. My people are different somehow. If only I could
remember. Yesterday, for one terrifying moment, there was clarity. 
CRUSHER: You mean the energy pulse? 
JOHN: Yes. For that moment my purpose seemed clear, and then it was
gone. 
CRUSHER: The pain, the energy pulse, must be linked to the cell
mutation in the body. I wish I could help you find the truth. 
JOHN: Beverly, you've done so much for me. I only wish there was some
way I could repay you. 
CRUSHER: But you have. The friendship we've developed has made me very
happy. 
JOHN: The rapport that exists between us also means a great deal to me.
But I am on some kind of journey. Whatever brought me here, whatever is
happening to my body, is all part of that journey. And I must complete
it before any other consideration.

[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, I am reading a vessel on long range
scanners. It is coming from sector nine five six nine. 
PICARD: What configuration? 
WORF: Impossible to identify at this distance. However, it is on an
intercept course. 
DATA: Captain, the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two. 
RIKER: Warp nine point seven two? 
PICARD: Time to intercept? 
DATA: At present course and speed, ten hours fifty three minutes. 
PICARD: Try and hail them, Mister Worf. 
WORF: No response, Captain. 
PICARD: Keep monitoring their approach. Repeat the hail every half an
hour. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here.

[Sickbay - room four]

(John has a big golden moment, and the alarm
sounds) 
TEMPLE: Doctor Crusher, medical emergency, room four. 
JOHN: I can't make it stop. 
CRUSHER: John, tell me. Is it worse than before? 
JOHN: Much worse. 
TEMPLE: Should I get something for the pain? 
CRUSHER: No. The readings are fluctuating too wildly. Besides, it
wouldn't do any good. His entire cell structure is transforming. 
JOHN: I have to leave, Beverly. 
CRUSHER: John, where do you have to go? 
JOHN: I must get off this ship. 
CRUSHER: That's impossible. Not in your condition. 
JOHN: I must! 
(another big moment, and he runs out the door)
