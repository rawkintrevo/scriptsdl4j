drinking beverages in pleasant cafes in shopping areas) 
DATA: We have only a few minutes before our next meeting, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: It's all right. We're finished. Waiter?

off. Beverly rushes to help) 
WORF: Doctor! 
[Plaza]

POLICEMAN: Keep back! 
CRUSHER: Put that away. I'm a doctor. (to an injured woman) Just lie
still. Try not to move. 
CRUSHER: Lieutenant Worf, I need some bandages, disinfectant, something
with alcohol in it. 
WORF: Doctor, it is not safe. 
CRUSHER: That's an order, Lieutenant. 
(She goes to the next casualty) 

CRUSHER: Don't be afraid. There's a lot of bleeding, but it's not as
bad as it looks. 
POLICEMAN: The Klingon's right. These Ansata, they're madmen. There
could be another bomb. (to bystanders) Clear this area. Everyone out
of the plaza.

Enterprise. There are physicians on this planet.
