RIKER WORF PICARD SALIA WESLEY DATA GIBSON ANYA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, get us to Daled as quickly as
possible. 
RIKER: Ensign Gibson, take us to warp eight point eight. 
GIBSON: (a strawberry blonde) Warp eight point eight, sir. 
RIKER: Estimated time? 
GIBSON: Three hours, nine minutes. 
PICARD: Ensign Crusher, when you're finished with your duties in
Engineering, report to my Ready Room. 
WESLEY [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: The woman, Anya, is not what she appears to
be. She is an allasomorph. 
WESLEY: A shape shifter? 
PICARD: Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl's
protector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personal
relationships of those under my command, but in this case. 
WESLEY: You want me to stay away from Salia? 
PICARD: Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyone
on board. 
WESLEY: I will do as you ask.

[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Why won't you let me have a friend? 
ANYA: It is my duty to protect you from danger. 
SALIA: There's no danger here. 
ANYA: There is always danger from one who is not your kind. Salia, he's
confusing you. You're forgetting you responsibilities. 
SALIA: Whether or not I see Wesley is for me to decide. 
ANYA: It is not! I raised you, I protected you and I intend to deliver
you to Daled Four! 
SALIA: Maybe what you want doesn't matter any more. 
ANYA: Salia, please. I know it's difficult for you. But you must do
what you are destined to do.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Standard orbit. 
GIBSON: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Captain, I am encountering the same interference we experienced
on Klavdia Three. 
DATA: The troposphere appears to be distorting our signals. It is
fascinating, Captain. Klavdia Three and Daled Four have almost
identical atmospheres. 
PICARD: Magnify. Times twenty. 
RIKER: How could anyone exist in an environment so totally hostile
toward human life? 
PICARD: Mister Data, do whatever is necessary to override the
interference. Let's complete our mission. 
[Wesley's quarters]

WESLEY: Come in. Salia! You shouldn't have come. 
SALIA: Do you want me to leave? 
WESLEY: I didn't say that. 
SALIA: Then you want me to stay. 
WESLEY: Does Anya know you're here? 
SALIA: That doesn't matter. 
WESLEY: I'm glad you came. I thought Anya would have kept you with her.

SALIA: I have certain rights. 
WESLEY: So in other words, you slipped out. 
SALIA: While she was asleep. I hope you didn't get in trouble from your
Captain. 
WESLEY: Oh, I haven't got in trouble yet. 
SALIA: Anya thought you would corrupt me. 
WESLEY: With my wild way of life? 
SALIA: Maybe. With the normal things people do when they like each
other. 
(Young love's first kiss, then Anya the monster is there, screeching) 
SALIA: Wesley, get out of here now. 
WESLEY: What's going on? 
SALIA: Just go, please. 
WESLEY: Security, crew quarters! 
SALIA: No! Anya, No! 
(Salia morphs into something bigger, and Wesley goes to safety. The two
women return to humanoid form) 
ANYA: You should not have disobeyed me. 
SALIA: I had to. 
ANYA: I warned you to leave her alone. 
Captain's log, stardate 42568.8. Since Anya's
powers of transformation
apparently gave her the ability to escape her
guards unnoticed, we have sealed her quarters with a forcefield that
will contain her no matter how small a form she may take.
