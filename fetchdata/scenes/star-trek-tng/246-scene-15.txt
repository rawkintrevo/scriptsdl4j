[Engineering]

(a display is beeping) 
LAFORGE: What the hell? Computer, perform a level three diagnostic on
the primary defensive systems. La Forge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: What is it, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: You might want to come down here. I found something that I
think you should see.

[Laboratory]

DATA: The computer has completed its analysis. 
CRUSHER: The computer was able to extrapolate this geometric pattern
based on the distribution of the fragments. 
(it is a zigzag or helix with one line missing, that overlays a star
chart) 
CRUSHER: Computer, highlight the section of the missing pattern. The
missing DNA fragment should be in this system. 
DATA: The star is in sector two one four five nine. The Rahm Izad
system. 
(and Ocett instantly beams out. The Enterprise is fired on by both
Cardassian ships) 
[Bridge]

WORF: Direct hit on our port nacelle. They are
powering up for another volley. 
RIKER: Let's make it look good. Ensign, release the inertial dampers. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
WORF: They are firing. 
(everything shakes as the Cardassians target the nacelle again and fly
off) 
PICARD: Report, Number One. 
RIKER: The power boost to the structural integrity field protected the
nacelles. We used the inertial dampers to simulate complete shield
failure. 
NU'DAQ: It is fortunate that your Engineer discovered Gul Ocett's
attempt to tamper with your defensive systems. Maht-H'a. Status. 
KLINGON [OC]: Minor damage to starboard nacelle. We will be operational
in less than one hour. 
NU'DAQ: What? You incompetent Top'a. You were supposed to be prepared. 
WORF: The Cardassian vessels have set a course for Rahm Izad. 
PICARD: Well, it won't take them long to realise that Rahm Izad is the
wrong planet. Captain, you're welcome to join us. 
NU'DAQ: I will go with you. 
PICARD: Ensign, set in a course for the Vilmoran System. Warp nine. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage. (later) 
DATA: I am scanning all seven planets of the Vilmoran system. None
appears to support life. 
RIKER: How can that be? The Professor's data depends on 
DATA: Correction. The second planet shows evidence of an ancient ocean,
now dry. 
LAFORGE: It once supported life. 
DATA: Yes, and it still may, in a limited fashion not detectable by our
long range sensors. 
RIKER: Lay in a course, Ensign. Full impulse. Riker to Transporter room
one.
