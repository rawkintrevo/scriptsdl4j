CRUSHER: We're ready down here. We have triage
teams standing by. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Very well. We'll begin transporting the
survivors on board immediately. Bridge out.

RUSSELL: Beverly, could you use an extra pair of
hands? 
CRUSHER: Absolutely.

[Worf's private room]

(Troi brings Worf a little visitor) 
ALEXANDER: Father? 
(Worf is wearing the motor assistance bands, and standing up) 
WORF: Come in, Alexander. 
ALEXANDER: Deanna said you hurt your back, that you couldn't walk. 
WORF: I am still struggling with my injury. 
ALEXANDER: I was worried about you. 
WORF: There is much to discuss. There will be difficult times ahead.
You must be strong. 
ALEXANDER: I understand. 
WORF: Good. As Klingons, we must always be prepared for any 
(a leg gives way and he falls to the floor) 
ALEXANDER: Father! 
WORF: Take him away. 
TROI: Worf, let me help you. 
WORF: Leave! 
TROI: Alexander, go on. It'll be all right. I'll take care of your
father.

[Shuttlebay]

(an emergency triage ward with a big notice about
variable gravity area on the wall) 
CRUSHER: Use this to cauterise the tissue. 
MEDIC: Yes, Doctor.
CRUSHER: What happened here? 
RUSSELL: He went into neural metaphasic shock. 
CRUSHER: From leporazine? That's unusual. 
RUSSELL: He couldn't take leporazine, his blood pressure was too low. I
had to try a different
treatment. 
CRUSHER: A morathial series? 
RUSSELL: No. I tried a new rybo-therapy I've been working with. It's
called borathium. I've had some very good results. 
CRUSHER: You used this man to test one of your theories? 
RUSSELL: Borathium is decades ahead of leporazine and morathial. 
CRUSHER: Morathial would have saved his life. 
RUSSELL: His injuries were so severe I don't think any conventional
treatment could've saved him. 
CRUSHER: The point is, you didn't even try standard treatments. 
RUSSELL: I made the choice I thought gave him the best chance of
surviving. Isn't that what you would have done? 
CRUSHER: I think you used this situation in order to test one of your
theories just like you're trying to do with Worf. 
RUSSELL: That's what this is really about, isn't it? Lieutenant Worf.
I'm offering him a chance to recover fully. A chance you can't give
him. 
CRUSHER: What this is about is the kind of medicine you seem to
practice. 
RUSSELL: I make no excuses for my approach to medicine. I don't like
losing a patient any more than you do. But I'm looking down a long
road, Doctor. This man didn't die for nothing. The data that I gathered
is invaluable. It will eventually help save thousands of lives. 
CRUSHER: I doubt if that will be any comfort his family. 
RUSSELL: Let me ask you this. If some years from now, borathium therapy
were to save the life of someone you loved, would you still condemn me?

CRUSHER: I will not be drawn into a hypothetical argument, Doctor. Your
research on this ship is over. You're relieved of all medical duties
until further notice. Is that clear? 
RUSSELL: Perfectly.
