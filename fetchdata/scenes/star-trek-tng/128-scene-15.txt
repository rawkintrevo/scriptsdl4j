WORF: Nothing on my communicator, sir. (to the
wall) Computer on. 
RIKER: Let's find a turbolift to the Bridge.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Transporter room, have you been able to
establish a lock? 
(The lights dim) 
COMPUTER: Emergency power engaged. 
PICARD: Initiate full check, all systems. 
LAFORGE: Engineering section, report. What is our situation? (silence)
Engineering? Captain, request permission to leave the Bridge. 
PICARD: Granted.

[USS Yamato corridor]

RIKER: This isn't a Federation ship. These walls
aren't tritanium. It's close, but it's material beyond our technology.
Let's get to the Bridge. There's got to be an answer to all of this
somewhere.

[USS Yamoto Bridge]

(They walk through a door labelled Turbolift and
straight onto the Bridge) 
RIKER: This Bridge should be four decks above us. What's going on here?

(They return to the turbolift, and the door opens to reveal - the
Bridge) 
WORF: That's not where we came from. 
RIKER: Wait a minute. 
WORF: Two Bridges? 
RIKER: If we go through there, where will we be? 
WORF: On the Bridge. 
RIKER: But we are on the Bridge. 
WORF: It's up to you, sir.
RIKER: Let's see what happens.

[USS Yamato Bridge Two]

WORF: Is it the same Bridge? 
RIKER: Or did we step from one Bridge onto another Bridge?

[Bridge]

(Everything suddenly comes back on) 
DATA: We've regained ship's communication, sir. 
HASKELL: (a red shirt who has suddenly replaced Wesley) Captain, I have
a star fix. 
PICARD: On screen. 
HASKELL: It's an opening, sir. 
DATA: Confirm, sir. Navigation is possible. 
HASKELL: Should I set a course? 
PICARD: Transporter room, do you have a fix on the away team? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Negative, Captain. 
PICARD: Damn.
