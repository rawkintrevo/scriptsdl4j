TASHA TROI RAMSEY CRUSHER LAFORGE

[Sickbay]

LAFORGE: [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay how are you Doing,
Doctor? 
CRUSHER: We have more sick than we do beds. So far I've been forced to
confine over three hundred to their private quarters. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: We're going to be seriously undermanned if
we're forced to engage the Romulans in battle. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: The Romulans are your problem, Lieutenant.
Trying to find an inoculants
is mine. This virus mutates every twenty minutes. But so far we haven't
had any fatalities, yet. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: If this continues, there'll be no one left
to run the ship. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: If this continues, Lieutenant La Forge, no
one will be healthy enough to care. 
[Bridge]

TASHA: [OC]: Yar to Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: Enterprise here. Go ahead. 
[Hideout]

TASHA: Prepare to beam three to our previous
location, Geordi. After re-grouping with Commander Riker, we'll return
to the ship. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I suggest you make that on the double,
Tasha. We have a real medical emergency brewing up here. 
[Hideout]

LAFORGE [OC]: One third of the crew is down, and
the latest information from the Neutral Zone outpost is that more
Romulan vessels are converging on that area. 
TASHA: I'll inform the Commander. Yar out. One thing before we go. You
said you were expecting us. Why? 
RAMSEY: I can't answer that. 
TROI: We wish you well, Mister Ramsey. 
TASHA: Energise. 
(The three beam away) 
RAMSEY: They're gone. 
(Ariel comes out and embraces him)
