PULASKI PICARD RIKER OBRIEN LAFORGE

[Steamy mangrove swamp]

LAFORGE: Acknowledged. 
RIKER: I wasn't ready to leave here anyway. 

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Here's the biofilter's analysis of the
microbes. 
PULASKI: That's not much to go on. 
O'BRIEN: I can override and beam Commander Riker aboard . 
PULASKI: No. I'd better go down and make an evaluation there. 
(She takes a deep, reluctant breath and gets on the pad) 
O'BRIEN: I hope these are the right coordinates. Just kidding, Doctor.
I know how much you love the transporter. 
PULASKI: About as much as I love comical Transporter Chiefs. 
O'BRIEN: Ready?

RIKER: Over here, Doctor. 
PULASKI: Fill me in. 
RIKER: I was walking along minding my own business, doing a simple
geological sweep. Something stuck me in the leg. 
PULASKI: Any pain? 
RIKER: No. Just a little numb, that's all. 
PULASKI: Do you know what it was that stuck you? 
LAFORGE: We've been looking for it. No luck. 
PULASKI: Well, whatever it was, it left something behind. I'm going to
take you up to Sickbay. O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski. 
[Transporter room]

PULASKI [OC]: Medical override is authorised. 
O'BRIEN: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

RIKER: This is the strangest feeling. My whole leg
just went dead. 
Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1. During a
geological survey on Surata Four, Commander Riker has become infected
by an unidentified microbe.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? 
RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd give
her a challenge. 
PULASKI: That you did. The Commander's nervous system has been invaded
by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with the
elements of both. There's the point of entry. The microbes are
infecting the great sciatic nerve, and they are multiplying at an
incredible rate. There. 
PICARD: Can you remove it? 
PULASKI: Not surgically. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining
at the molecular level. 
RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extract
it. 
PULASKI: There's no evidence of nerve damage, but the organisms are
impeding nervous function. 
RIKER: My leg's still asleep. 
PICARD: Prognosis? 
PULASKI: The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the
brain. 
PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? 
PULASKI: Commander Riker could die. 
PICARD: How can I help? 
PULASKI: I need to know more about its composition. 
PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. 
PULASKI: Exactly. 
PICARD: Commander Data, Mister La Forge, prepare to beam down to the
planet. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.
