[Observation lounge]

GOWRON: jIH DoQ batlh! 
PICARD: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We are
ready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess while
I review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about the
explosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuing
your investigations? 
GOWRON: The investigations are complete. They revealed nothing of any
importance. 
PICARD: Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up some
startling results. (into
comm.) Will you join us, Lieutenant? 
(Worf enters) 
DURAS: What is this? 
GOWRON: He has no place here, Picard! 
DURAS: I will not sit at the same table with that! 
PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be
relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my Chief
Security Officer. His presence is required. 
DURAS: We will not proceed. 
PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option.
Proceed, Mister Worf. 
WORF: What did your investigations reveal about the explosion? 
DURAS: It was a bomb. 
WORF: And was your analysis just as insightful? 
GOWRON: It was a common explosive. 
WORF: What type? 
GOWRON: Triceron. 
WORF: What about the detonator? 
DURAS: This is pointless! The findings were inconclusive. 
WORF: Fortunately, our investigation was more thorough. The bomb used a
molecular-decay detonator. 
GOWRON: What? 
PICARD: A Romulan device. 
DURAS: I will return to my ship to confirm these conclusions myself. 
GOWRON: As will I. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of our
findings to both vessels and to the High Council. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: That will be all.

DURAS: Advise my counsellors on the Vorn to
convene. There is much to discuss. 
KLINGON: Look. 
DURAS: What is this? 
KLINGON: Priority message to you from the home planet. It seems
Ambassador K'Ehleyr is looking into things she should not be. 
DURAS: Distract the guard for me. 
KLINGON: Yes, sir. 
(And simply walks out of the room into the corridor) 
GUARD: Sir. Excuse me, sir. You cannot leave your quarters without an
escort.
