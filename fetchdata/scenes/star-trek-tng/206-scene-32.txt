to send pulses of energy at the forcefield generator before ducking
down a side corridor)

LAFORGE: We've got him, Captain. Section twenty

phaser. 
PICARD: Security to deck six, section twenty five.

RIKER: Where the hell is he? 
WORF: I am attempting to isolate him with thermal sensors. 
RIKER: Narrow the scan field. Go deck by deck if you have to. 
WORF: Unfortunately, he knows our procedures. He will avoid corridors
and public areas. Commander, an unidentified heat source. Deck seven,
section twenty three. There.
