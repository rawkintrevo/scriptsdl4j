planet, the people are friendly. Where you go from there is your
business. 
MORIARTY: Please tell your Captain I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye. I
do wish I could see his face when he realises where he's been the last
several hours. 
RIKER: Every second we waste puts us in that much more danger.

ship.
