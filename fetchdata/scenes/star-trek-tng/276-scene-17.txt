KALITA: This is insane. We're sitting here, no
sensors, blind to the outside, waiting for a galaxy class Starship to
come swooping down on us. 
RO: Don't worry. It'll be hard for them to locate us with just the
directional sensors. Besides, they're looking for a damaged science
ship that wants to be found. They're here. Standby to engage thrusters.

RIKER: Anything? 
DATA: No, sir. It will take approximately six hours to scan this
system. 
WORF: Captain, the distress call is being repeated. 
PICARD: Data, can you locate the signal? 
DATA: I am attempting to do so.

[Ro's ship]

KALITA: They're scanning our last position. 
RO: All right, I've locked onto their sensor beam. I'm going to use it
to manoeuvre into transporter range. 
KALITA: How are we going to beam through their shields? 
RO: We can't. If we're going to get those medical supplies, we're going
to have to take this ship through their shields.

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which the
distress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. 
WORF: Captain, the computer has detected a piggyback communication on
the last distress signal. 
PICARD: Can you decode it? 
WORF: It will take a few moments. 
PICARD: Do it.
