[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Shield modulation has failed. They've
locked on. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Shields are being drained. Ninety percent.
Eighty. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Trying to recalibrate nutation. Damn. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Shields have failed. 
PICARD: Fire all weapons.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Their subspace field is intact. New phaser
frequencies had no impact. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Reverse engines. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Full reverse. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're not moving. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Fire at will. 
WORF: Launching torpedoes. Phaser spread continuing. 
DATA: Still no damage to the Borg vessel, sir. 
(The Borg weapon cuts through the Enterprise like a hot knife through
butter, almost.) 
COMPUTER: Warning. Outer hull breach.
WORF: They're cutting into the hull. Engineering section. 
RIKER: Geordi, evacuate Engineering.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Computer. Evacuation sequence. 
COMPUTER: Sealing doors to core chamber. 
LAFORGE: Come on, move it, people! Let's go! Let's go! 
COMPUTER: Decompression danger, deck thirty six, section four. 
[Bridge]

COMPUTER: Sealing Main Engineering. 
SHELBY: Data, fluctuate phaser resonance frequencies. Random settings.
Keep them changing. Don't give them time to adapt. 
(Finally, boom and judder) 
WORF: The tractor beam has been released. 
PICARD: Warp nine. Course, one five one mark three three zero. Engage. 
(La Forge enters the Bridge)
WORF: They are in pursuit, Captain. 
PICARD: Maintain course. 
RIKER: Damage report, Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Hull rupture in main Engineering. The damage is pretty heavy.
We lost a lot of good people down there. 
DATA: Eleven dead, eight more unaccounted for, Captain. 
RIKER: Repair teams to Engineering. Seal hull breach. 
LAFORGE: They didn't get to the core I can control functions from here.

WESLEY: Now approaching the Paulson Nebula, sir. 
PICARD: Drop to impulse. Take us in, Ensign. 
(Enterprise glides into the purple fog) 
WESLEY: The field is getting too dense, sir. 
PICARD: Steady. Analysis of the nebula cloud, Mister Data. 
DATA: Eighty two percent dilithium hydroxyls. Magnesium,
chromium. It should provide an effective screen against their sensors,
Captain. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, prepare to reverse engines. Full stop. 
(The Enterprise vanishes, and the Borg cube halts) 
WORF: The Borg ship is continuing scans, attempting to locate us. 
PICARD: Good. As long as they're looking for us, they won't hurt anyone
else.
