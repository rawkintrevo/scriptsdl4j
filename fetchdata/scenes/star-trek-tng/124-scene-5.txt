PICARD: Computer, this is Captain Picard. 
COMPUTER: Holodeck three is clear. 
PICARD: Location, Paris, Cafe des Artistes, as it appeared twenty two
years ago. April the ninth, fifteen hundred hours, three o'clock. Warm
spring day. 
COMPUTER: Programme complete. 
[Cafe des Artistes]

(Picard is greeted by the head waiter) 
EDOUARD: Monsieur, welcome to the Cafe des Artistes. Is this your first
time in Paris? 
PICARD: No. 
EDOUARD: This way. 
PICARD: That table. 
EDOUARD: Mais oui, bien sur, monsieur. We are here to please you. 
(Picard gazes from the balcony towards le Tour d'Eiffel, and the
otherwise future city-scape) 
PICARD: I've been away far too long. 
EDOUARD: Some wine, some cheese? 
PICARD: I'm not very hungry. I really came for the view. 
EDOUARD: Perhaps what you hunger for is not on the menu. 
PICARD: Perhaps not. It was many years ago, I had a rendezvous. I was
to meet someone. Someone here, at this very table. 
EDOUARD: Your young lady, she did not come? 
PICARD: Actually, I don't know. I always imagined that she did. 
EDOUARD: You, however, did not. Ah. Well, trust Edouard. I will bring
something very special, just for you. 
(Two young women are talking at the next table) 
FRANCINE: Let's go. We've waited long enough. 
GABRIELLE: Fine. You go. I'll stay a little longer.
FRANCINE: He's not coming, Gabrielle. 
GABRIELLE: No, after last night, I know he will. I just know. 
FRANCINE: Then he would be here. You are making a fool out of yourself,
and I will not watch. 
(Francine walks away) 
GABRIELLE: Do we know each other? 
PICARD: No. 
GABRIELLE: The way you look at me, do I remind you of someone? 
PICARD: No. Yes, you do, somewhat. 
GABRIELLE: He's not coming. Why? What did I do to drive him away? 
PICARD: Maybe you did nothing. Maybe he had no choice. Maybe he was
afraid. 
GABRIELLE: Of what? Of me? 
PICARD: Oh, of being connected, rooted. Perhaps if he's as young as you
are, he doesn't know yet exactly what he wants to do. Maybe. Enough of
this self-indulgence. Exit.

RIKER: Captain, we've received communication from
the freighter Lalo, as well as from a farming colony on Coltar Four.
Both described the same time distortion. The Captain of the Lalo
described it a hiccup. 
PICARD: Hiccup? 
DATA: Actually sir, that may be an incorrect analogy. 
PICARD: How so, Data? 
DATA: A hiccup is a spasmodic inhalation with closure of the glottis.
accompanied by a peculiar sound. If we were to continue this analogy to
a body function, what occurred would be best represented by a 
PICARD: That's enough, Data. Have you been able to learn more specifics
about the Manheim project? 
DATA: All I have found sir, is what you already know. Manheim was
concentrating on time gravity experiments when he left. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we've reached the coordinates specified. There's
nothing here. 
WORF: I'm receiving new coordinates. It's a relay signal. Same source
as the first one. 
LAFORGE: What are they, Worf? 
WORF: Six six four point eight by one three two three point seven by
four nine four nine point nine. 
LAFORGE: Very remote area, sir. It's in the middle of the Vandor
system, a binary star system. Main star's a B class giant, the
companion star's a pulsar. 
PICARD: Set course for the new coordinates, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Why is he making it this difficult to find him? 
PICARD: Hopefully he'll tell us, Number One. 
(Later) 
LAFORGE: We have reached the coordinates, Captain. 
DATA: Sensors indicate it is Vandor Four, a planetoid in elliptical
orbit around the binary system. 
PICARD: Standard orbit, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Give me a visual. 
WORF: Viewscreen on. There's a small forcefield on the planet. Latitude
twenty degrees, nine minutes north. Longitude forty degrees, two
minutes east of the present terminator. 
PICARD: Penetrable? 
DATA: No, sir. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: This is Captain. This is the Captain of the USS Enterprise
responding to your signal for help. 
JENICE [OC]: Enterprise, thank you for hearing us. Where are you? 
PICARD: We're in orbit around Vandor now. 
JENICE [OC]: Then you can help me. I don't know what to do. It's only
the two of us left. He's having convulsions. Please. 
PICARD: Can you lock on to her coordinates? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. The forcefield is preventing any kind of contact
other than audio. 
PICARD: There is a force field at your location. 
JENICE [OC]: Yes. I know. 
PICARD: Good. But it is preventing us from helping you. Now, you must
find some way to shut it down. 
JENICE [OC]: I'll try. 
WORF: Force field is off. 
PICARD: Good. Lock onto their coordinates. Beam them up directly to
Sickbay. Doctor Crusher, prepare for a Medical Emergency. Two to beam
directly up to Sickbay. 
CRUSHER [OC]: We'll be ready, Captain. 
PICARD: That's where I'll be. Number One. Mister Data.
