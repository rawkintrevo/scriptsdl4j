[Bridge]

BROSSMER [OC]: I've done all I can, sir. I'm afraid
they're gone. 
PICARD: Mister Data, begin a level one diagnostic. All transporter
systems offline until further notice. Could they have materialised
somewhere else? 
DATA: Negative, Captain. Sensors are unable to locate them anywhere
within transporter range. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
(Troi shakes her head) 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Enterprise. 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.

[Romulan Engineering]

RIKER: Captain, we're still looking at a core
breach unless we can fashion a new graviton generator. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: I need replacement personnel, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, you may continue the diagnostic of the transporter
systems at another time. Take a shuttlecraft and two more engineers
down to the Romulan ship. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister McDowell, alert the main shuttlebay to have all
available ships and pilots standing by in case we need them. 
MCDOWELL: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Ensign, lay in a course away from the Romulan vessel. Engage at
warp one if you detect any sign it's going to explode.

[Romulan Engineering]

MIROK: Pressure in the containment chamber has
increased fifteen melakols in the last two minutes. 
RIKER: What can we do to stop the overload? 
MIROK: Most of the conduits were damaged during the explosion. I can't
even access the central computer. 
WORF: Commander. Emergency bulkheads have sealed this section off from
the rest of the ship. There is no way to gain access to the main Bridge
or control centres. 
RIKER: Survivors? 
WORF: Readings indicate at least seventy three Romulans are still
alive. 
VAREL: Seventy three. 
(an alarm sounds) 
MIROK: The pressure has jumped two hundred melakols! 
VAREL: I've lost control of the containment chamber. 
MIROK: It's going to implode. 
RIKER: We'll need to dump the entire engine core. Do you have an
auto-eject system? 
MIROK: Yes, but it's not functioning. I'll have to do it manually. 
RIKER: Mister Worf, you two seal the chamber. 
VAREL: Implosion will occur in one minute five seconds. 
RIKER: Enterprise, we need to jettison the entire engine core. You'll
need to extend the shields once it clears the hull. 
PICARD [OC]: Understood, Number One. We'll stand by for your signal. 
(Worf and Varel have got to the manual latches and undone them) 
WORF: We must get the doors closed. 
(but Worf can't move the debris jamming them open) 
WORF: Commander! 
RIKER: Time? 
VAREL: Thirty seconds. 
(the three men finally shift the girder and start to pull the doors
shut) 
MIROK: I'm ready, Commander. 
RIKER: Stay there! Eject the chamber on my order! 
DATA: Excuse me, sir. 
(Data takes over and pulls the doors shut) 
MIROK: Implosion in five seconds) 
RIKER: Now. 
(everything shakes as the core is ejected) 
RIKER: Enterprise, extend shields! 
(KaBOOM) 
RIKER: Well, we're still here. 
MIROK: Yes.

[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: We'll have a complete power survey done
within the hour. We'll probably have to supply them with energy for
life support, and they'll need a new engine core to get home. 
PICARD: Understood, Commander. Keep us informed of your efforts. Picard
out. I'll be in Sickbay. 
MCDOWELL: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

(Picard walks past Ro lying on the floor. She wakes
up) 
RO: Ensign Ro to the Bridge. This is Ensign Ro reporting in. I'm at
section twenty three baker, near Sickbay. (she wobbles) Sickbay.
