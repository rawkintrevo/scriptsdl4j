(Clara is doing a puzzle while Isabella just sits
holding a teddy bear) 
ISABELLA: Are you mad at me? I'm sorry I got you in trouble. 
CLARA: That's okay. 
ISABELLA: Are we still best friends? 
CLARA: Here, you can help me put this together if you want. 
ISABELLA: Clara, why are grown-ups so mean? 
CLARA: They're not mean. They're just more serious than we are. 
ISABELLA: Sometimes I wish they would just go away. 
CLARA: You do? 
ISABELLA: Yes, I don't like them. I'm bored. Let's go back to
Engineering. 
CLARA: We're not allowed to go there. 
ISABELLA: I thought we were best friends. 
CLARA: We are. 
ISABELLA: Then why won't you play with me? 
CLARA: I told you. 
ISABELLA: You always listen to the grown-ups. You don't care about me. 
CLARA: That's not true. 
ISABELLA: I thought we'd have fun together, once you could really see
me. I thought you'd like me. Let's go to Engineering, Clara. Just for a
little while. No one will know. It'll be our secret. And if they find
us, we'll tell them we got lost. 
(doorbell) 
CLARA: Who is it? 
TROI [OC]: Counsellor Troi. 
(Isabella vanishes and Clara lets Troi in) 
TROI: Hello, Clara. 
CLARA: Hi. 
TROI: I came to ask if you'd like to go to a ceramics class. 
CLARA: Can Isabella come too? 
TROI: No. Let's do something with Isabella another day. 
CLARA: Well, okay. 
(Troi and Clara leave, Isabella appears and her eyes turn red)

DATA: Sir, as we move deeper into the nebula,
sensors indicate that the levels of helium and trionium are continuing
to rise. 
PICARD: Is it something that the shields can't handle? 
DATA: No, sir. We are well within tolerance levels. 
(the ship shakes and the lights flicker) 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: Shields have registered an impact. 
PICARD: But the sensors show nothing out there, right? 
DATA: There is no indication of anything near the ship. 
WORF: Forward velocity is dropping, Captain. Down by point four
percent. 
PICARD: Can we go to warp speed? 
DATA: Until we determine the cause of the drag coefficient, I would not
recommend it, sir. 
WORF: Forward velocity down by one point one percent. 
PICARD: Ensign, increase power to the impulse engines. 
FELTON: Aye, sir. Impulse engines now at full power. 
WORF: We are no longer losing speed. Forward velocity is holding
steady. 
DATA: The drag coefficient is still present, but it has stabilised. 
PICARD: Bridge to Commander Riker. Check with Mister La Forge. See if
he found anything in the matter sample from the nebula. 
RIKER [OC]: On my way, sir.

[Engineering]

RIKER: Any luck? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, take a look at this. We tried radiating the subject
matter with just about everything we could think of. We didn't find
anything until we subjected it to a high frequency warp field. We think
this is what we've been running into. 
RIKER: Do you know what it is? 
LAFORGE: We think so, now that the sensors can read it. It seems to be
a highly cohesive form of plasma, like a strand of energy. 
SUTTER: We figure it's a segment of just part of a network of much
larger strands. 
LAFORGE: When these things come in contact with our shields it produces
a resonant effect, and that creates the drag coefficient we've been
experiencing. 
RIKER: Is there anything like this on record? 
LAFORGE: No, sir. 
RIKER: Do you know how many of them there might be? 
LAFORGE: No, but if we run the warp field generators through the
deflector grid, we could radiate a field outside the ship. 
RIKER: And we'd be able to see for ourselves. Let's do it. 
[Children's centre]

TROI: Alexander, I thought you might like a
partner. This is Clara Sutter. She's new on the Enterprise. Clara, meet
Alexander Rozhenko. 
ALEXANDER: I'm making a cup for my father. Want to help? 
TROI: Go ahead. 
(Clara adds a point to the side of the goblet at random) 
ALEXANDER: Well, you're supposed to put them in a row, like this. 
TROI: Clara, would you like some clay of your own? 
TEACHER: Here, honey. 
(and puts a protective gown on her) 
CLARA: I've never made a cup before. How do you make the round part? 
ALEXANDER: Well, it's easy. You take a big piece of clay like this, and
push your hand into it.

[Bridge]

WORF: Warp field generators are standing by. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we should be able to illuminate any strands within
two thousand kilometres of the ship. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
LAFORGE: Initiating field generation. 
PICARD: Remarkable. 
(there are lots of red strands, like a loose spider web) 
DATA: It is an irregular lattice composed of approximately forty seven
million strands of energy. 
LAFORGE: Captain, with this many of them, the resonant effect on our
shields could cause a problem. 
PICARD: Agreed. Ensign, bring us about. Take us out of the nebula. 
DATA: It may be difficult, sir. I am detecting a significant number of
strands behind us. 
PICARD: Do your best, Ensign. 
FELTON: Aye, sir.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Hot chocolate. Computer, I need my
appointment schedule for next week. 
(the cup of chocolate falls over on its own. She picks it up, gets a
cloth and when she comes back, the cup is on its side again)
