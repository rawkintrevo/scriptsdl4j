[Ten Forward]

PICARD: The pleasure of your company is requested,
Counsellor. We're having a little impromptu reception for the arriving
delegates. 

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Captain, I'm not really dressed for a
reception. 
PICARD [OC]: Oh, Counsellor 
[Ten Forward]

PICARD: Just throw on any old thing. We're about to
get our first look at the wormhole. 
TROI [OC]: Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. 
[Troi's quarters]

TROI: God forbid I should miss my first look at the
wormhole.

[Ten Forward]

RIKER: May I escort you, Miss Troi? 
TROI: Just tell me there's some chocolate here. 
PICARD: Ah, Counsellor Troi. Will you allow me to do the introductions?
This is Premier Bhavani of Barzan. Counsellor Deanna Troi. 
TROI: Your discovery has produced a great deal of excitement, Premier. 
BHAVANI: Hopefully, it will also produce a new era of prosperity for my
people. 
MENDOZA: We'll see to that. 
PICARD: You know Mister Mendoza, the Federation negotiator. 
MENDOZA: A pleasure to see you again, Counsellor Troi. 
PICARD: This is a worthy Federation competitors in the bidding, Leyor
of the Caldonians. 
(About eight feet tall with the prosthetic head, it's the same man who
played the Predator) 
LEYOR: Madame. 
RAL: And I'm Devinoni Ral. 
(a handsome human with a woman hanging onto his arm) 
TROI: Ship's Counsellor Deanna Troi. 
MENDOZA: My good friend, Ral, is the best hired gun in the business. 
TROI: Hired gun? 
RAL: My good friend Mendoza means that I'm a negotiator who serves a
variety of clients. On this particular occasion I represent the
Chrysalians. 
BHAVANI: I believe it's almost time, isn't it Captain? 
PICARD: Indeed. It will be visible directly ahead. 
MENDOZA: Is it always on time, Bhavani? 
BHAVANI: Always. We see it every two hundred and thirty three minutes.
Our scientists say it's due to radiation buildup in the
accretion disk. The visible burst is very brief. 
(a circular burst of light) 
BHAVANI: There it is, ladies and gentlemen, the first and only stable
wormhole known to exist. It's yours, for the right price. 
(but Troi's attention is taken up by Ral) 
Captain's log, Stardate 43385.6. We are orbiting
Barzan Two, which is entertaining bids for control of what appears to
be a stable wormhole, which could provide a permanent shortcut to the
distant Gamma Quadrant.
