[Injector room]

(Geordi removes the panel) 
WOMAN: No! 
(Troi sees Pierce in his UP coverall) 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, are you all right? 
TROI: Something happened when you removed the panel. There's something
in there. 
DATA: I am getting readings that indicate organic material embedded in
this wall. 
LAFORGE: Organic? You're right. Let me reconfigure the emitter beam. We
might be able to see what it is. There. 
(skull, ribcage, spine)

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: This dosage should prevent any further
empathic flashes. 
CALLOWAY: The bone fragments are definitely human. I sequenced a DNA
sample. I'll see if I can match it to Starfleet records. 
(Worf goes to stand over Calloway at the console) 
CALLOWAY: Accessing Starfleet personnel records. 
(Worf and Calloway talk under the dialogue, and Troi keeps looking at
them) 
CRUSHER: I'd say these fragments had been in the wall about seven or
eight years. You said something happened when the panel was opened. 
TROI: Yes. 
CRUSHER: I wonder if the fragments themselves could have somehow
triggered your experience. I'll run a resonance scan, see if anything
turns up. 
CALLOWAY: Sir, I think we've found a match. 
WORF: Apparently the remains are those of an Ensign Marla Finn. 
CALLOWAY: I'm trying to find a picture of her in the records. 
TROI: That's her. That's the woman I saw. 
CRUSHER: It says she was reported missing from Utopia Planitia on
stardate 40987.2. Eight years ago. But how did her body become embedded
in a bulkhead? 
CALLOWAY: Maybe there was some kind of an accident. 
WORF: Or she was killed and the murderer hid her remains. 
TROI: Something's not right. Pull up Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
I thought so. He didn't arrive at the shipyard until six months after
Finn's death. I couldn't have been seeing through his eyes. 
CRUSHER: Then whose? 
TROI: Well it had to be someone who was at least partially telepathic. 
WORF: Pierce? 
CRUSHER: But you saw him there. 
TROI: Yes, but not as clearly as I could see everything else. His face
looked like that. 
CRUSHER: A reflection. 
TROI: So I was seeing through his eyes. And Finn was trying to get away
from him. She was afraid of him. 
WORF: I think it is time we had another conversation with Lieutenant
Pierce. Ensign Calloway, thank you for your help.

[Turbolift]

WORF: Deck ten. 
TROI: Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened last
night? 
WORF: No, of course not. 
TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise our
friendship. 
WORF: Deanna, I do not regret being with you. What is wrong? 
TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used to
sensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. 
WORF: Perhaps I should talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone. 
TROI: That might be a good idea. 
WORF: I will meet you in your quarters later. 
TROI: I'll be waiting for you. 
(Worf leaves) 
TROI: Deck eight.

[Troi's quarters]

TROI: Come in. 
(it's Pierce) 
TROI: Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters. 
SECURITY [OC]: Acknowledged. 
PIERCE: I don't understand. Lieutenant Worf said you wanted to talk to
me about something. 
TROI: Where is he? 
PIERCE: He said he had to go somewhere. 
TROI: Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lieutenant Worf? 
COMPUTER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf is in Ensign Calloway's quarters. 
(Security arrive) 
CREWWOMAN: Counsellor? 
TROI: Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there.

[Corridor]

(Troi gets to Calloway's quarters and decides
against ringing the bell) 
TROI: Security override, authorisation Troi Delta two nine.

[Calloway's quarters]

(Worf and Calloway are embracing as Troi enters.
Calloway starts laughing, then Worf.) 
TROI: Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! 
(Deanna grabs a convenient phaser and shoots Worf) 
CALLOWAY: He's dead! You killed him! 
TROI: No! No!
