DATA: I have completed another full scan of the
area, sir. There is no further indication of the anomaly. 
PICARD: Ensign, prepare to resume course to T'lli Beta. Mister Data,
what velocity would put us back on schedule? 
DATA: A resumption of our present course at warp six will place us in
the T'lli Beta system in six days, thirteen hours, forty seven minutes.

RIKER: What, no seconds? 
DATA: I have discovered, sir, a certain level of impatience when I
calculate a lengthy time interval to the nearest second. However, if
you wish 
RIKER: No, no. Minutes is fine. 
PICARD: Stand ready at warp six, Ensign. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage. 
(there's a jolt, and red alert comes on) 
RIKER: Riker to Engineering. Geordi, what the hell happened?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Checking. Looks like the field collapsed
before we could enter warp.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Recommend full stop while I check it
out. 
PICARD: Back to full stop, Ensign. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. 
DATA: All decks reporting minor injuries only. 
PICARD: Damage? 
DATA: None, sir. 
WORF: Weapons and shields normal. 
RIKER: Go to yellow alert. 
ALLENBY: Captain, we've started moving again. Something is pulling us.
