thrown gradually accident tank communicating caught decompression report lifeforms

[Raman Auxiliary control]

DATA [OC]: Reversing tractor beam. 
(Silva is thrown off and reveals herself as a flame before reverting to
the image of Geordi's mother again) 
LAFORGE: What are you? 
SILVA: You're killing us. We must go down. 
PICARD [OC]: Geordi?

[Laboratory]

PICARD: What's happening? Report. 
LAFORGE: You're, you're trapped? 
PICARD: Is there any way that we can disconnect him? 
CRUSHER: If we take him off too abruptly, he'll go into neural shock. 
LAFORGE: Caught on the ship? 
PICARD: Reduce the input gradually, and still get him out before it's
too late. 
LAFORGE: Are you saying that you killed the Raman's crew? 
DATA: Perhaps we could deceive his neural receptors. 
PICARD: Deceive them? 
DATA: By feeding them the sensory information recorded from his earlier
experiences with the probe. 
CRUSHER: We could disconnect the interface and still maintain the input
levels. 
DATA: We could then lower them in a controlled manner. 
LAFORGE: What do you want? 
PICARD: Like a decompression tank? Let's try it. 
LAFORGE: Then, it was an accident? Captain, I have to take the ship
into the lower atmosphere. 
PICARD: Explain. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: As I understand it, when the Raman got
close to the planet it accidentally picked up some lifeforms that live
in the lower atmosphere. 
[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: Subspace beings of some kind. Intelligent.
When the ship went back into a higher orbit, the beings were trapped. 
PICARD: How do you know all this? 
LAFORGE: One of them can communicate with me. 
[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: It must have read my thoughts through the
probe interface and took the form of my mother to try to talk me into
taking the ship closer to the surface. 
PICARD [OC]: Are these beings

[Laboratory]

PICARD: Responsible for the death of the Raman's
crew? 
LAFORGE: Yes, but I don't think it was on purpose. They probably tried
communicating with them the same way they're communicating with me, by
directly accessing their thoughts. It must've been fatal to the crew. I
guess the interface is what protected me.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: I have to take them back, Captain. They
can't survive so far up in the atmosphere. I'll turn the ship around
and come back as soon as I'm
