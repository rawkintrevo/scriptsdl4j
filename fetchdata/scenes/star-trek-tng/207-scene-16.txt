[Bridge]

RIKER: As soon as I heard this Barolian ship was at
the Galorndon Core, I started to think Romulans. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: And the Romulans are suddenly very interested
in bonding with the Vulcans. Spock has been meeting with the new Senate
Proconsul about reunification. 
RIKER: Reunification?
PICARD [on viewscreen]: The Proconsul says that he is prepared to
endorse peace talks. 
RIKER: And Spock?
PICARD [on viewscreen]: The Ambassador is sceptical, but he cares a
great deal about reunification. As long as there's a chance of success,
he's prepared to pursue it.
TROI: I'm afraid I don't see how a stolen Vulcan ship fits into all
this. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Neither do I, Counsellor. How soon can you be
at Galorndon Core, Number One?
RIKER: A little over eight hours.
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Well, this may prove to be a wild goose chase,
but I don't see that we have any other choice, do you?
RIKER: Agreed.
DATA: We are losing our Romulan carrier wave, sir. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: We'll advise you further as soon as you reach
your destination, Number One. Picard out.
(transmission ends)
RIKER: Ensign, set a course to Galorndon Core. Take us to warp eight. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir.

[Klingon bridge]

DATA: Captain, the Romulan subspace logs identify a
transmission from the Romulan surface to a Barolian ship near Galorndon
Core twelve hours ago.
K'VADA: Galorndon Core is along the Barolian trade route. They trade a
great deal with the Romulans. It's probably just routine. 
DATA: This would not appear to be routine. I was able to trace the
source of the transmission. It incorporates the code prefix of Romulan
intelligence.
PICARD: Can you access it?
DATA: It is a short sequence of numbers. One four zero zero. 
PICARD: Nothing more?
DATA: No, sir.

[Romulan street]

D'TAN: Spock! I've been looking for you. 
SPOCK: I have been meeting with the Proconsul. 
D'TAN: Does he still speak of reunification?
SPOCK: He speaks of nothing else.
