REMMICK: I want some answers from you now,
Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Later. 
REMMICK: You were ordered to cooperate 
RIKER: Not now. (enters turbolift) When it doesn't interfere with my
duties, Remmick.

COMPUTER: Last question on the hyperspace physics
test. If the matter and antimatter tanks on a Galaxy class starship are
nine tenths depleted, calculate the intermix ratio necessary to reach a
starbase a hundred light years away at warp factor eight. Begin. 
(Wesley is straight in with 1:1. Oliana runs out of time) 
COMPUTER: Time elapsed. You now have one hour free before the next
test. 
MORDOCK: I must admit, Wesley, you have a very fast mind. 
WESLEY: Once as I realised it was a trick question, there was only one
answer. 
MORDOCK: Yes, there is only one ratio with matter antimatter. One to
one. 
OLIANA: You don't know how lucky you are. I can't imagine what it would
be like to have things come so easily. I have to push every step of the
way. 
WESLEY: Oh, no, Oliana, it doesn't come that easily. I have to study
all the time. 
OLIANA: It's a good thing you're cute, Wesley, or you could really be
obnoxious. See you later. 
(Oliana leaves) 
WESLEY: Did you hear what she said, Mordock? She said I was cute. 
MORDOCK: Is that good, Wesley? 
WESLEY: Yes! I think.

RIKER: I think I should apologise, Captain. 
PICARD: No need, Number One. Mister Remmick's presence is unnerving, to
say the least. 
REMMICK: Are you available now, Mister Riker? Or do you still have
duties to perform? 
RIKER: I'm available, Mister Remmick. 
REMMICK: Any problem with using your Ready room, Captain? 
PICARD: No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest.
