[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
WESLEY: Captain. 
PICARD: Can you tell me what manoeuvre this is? 
(on the PADD we see five ships go into a circle, cross each other's
paths and light up a five pointed star) 
WESLEY: It's a Kolvoord Starburst, sir. 
PICARD: Five ships crossing within ten metres of each other and
igniting their plasma trails. One of the most spectacular and difficult
demonstrations of precision flying. It hasn't been performed at the
Academy team in over a hundred years. Do you know why? 
WESLEY: It was banned by the Academy following a training accident,
sir. 
PICARD: An accident in which all five cadets lost their lives. I think
that Nicholas Locarno wanted to end his Academy career in a blaze of
glory. That he convinced the four of you to learn the Kolvoord
Starburst for the commencement demonstration. If it worked,
you would thrill the assembled guests and Locarno would graduate as a
living legend. Only it didn't work, and Joshua Albert paid the price.
Am I correct? Cadet, I asked you a question. Am I correct? 
WESLEY: I choose not to answer, sir. 
PICARD: You choose not to answer? But you've already given an answer to
the inquiry, and that answer was a lie. 
WESLEY: I said the accident occurred after the loop. It did. 
PICARD: What you neglected to mention was that following the loop your
team attempted a manoeuvre that was the direct cause of the crash. You
told the truth up to a point. But a lie of omission is still a lie. Do
you remember the day you first came aboard this ship? Your mother
brought you on the Bridge. 
WESLEY: Yes. 
PICARD: You even sat in my chair. I was annoyed. Presumptuous child
playing on my ship. But I never forgot how you already knew every
control, every display. You behaved as though you belonged on the
Bridge. And then later when I decided to make you an acting ensign, I
was convinced you could be an outstanding officer. I've never
questioned that conviction, until now. The first duty of every
Starfleet officer is to the truth. Whether it's scientific truth, or
historical truth, or personal truth. It is the guiding principle upon
which Starfleet is based. If you can't find it within yourself to stand
up and tell the truth about what happened you don't deserve to wear
that uniform. I'm going to make this simple for you, Mister Crusher.
Either you come forward and tell Admiral Brand what really took place,
or I will. 
WESLEY: Captain 
PICARD: Dismissed.
