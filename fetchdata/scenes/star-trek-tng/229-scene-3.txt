[Ready room]

ALKAR: I am grateful for the Federation's offer to
escort me, but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia on board the Enterprise,
the armed flagship of Starfleet, my mission as negotiator of peace will
be compromised. There must be a Federation transport ship somewhere in
the area that could take me there.
PICARD: With all due respect. Admiral, to put the Ambassador on board
another unarmed transport would be to invite a second assault.
ALKAR: I believe the attack on us was an isolated incident, nothing
more.
SIMONS [on monitor]: Ambassador Alkar, the Rekag-Seronia dispute has
threatened Federation ships for many months. We are grateful that you
are willing to undertake this mission and you have our full support.
ALKAR: Thank you, sir.
SIMONS [on monitor]: However, we also recognise that safety is an
issue. Not just yours, but the crew that escorts you. To send you on an
unarmed transport puts everyone at risk. I think it best if you proceed
to Rekag-Seronia aboard the Enterprise. 
ALKAR: Then I have no choice.
SIMONS [on monitor]: Once you get to Rekag-Seronia, you can conduct
your negotiations as you see fit. Until then, you'll be in good hands
with Captain Picard.
ALKAR: I understand, sir.
SIMONS [on monitor]: Good luck, and a successful journey.
(transmission ends) 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker.
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir?
PICARD: Set a course for Seronia. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Gymnasium]

(Worf is leading a Klingon Tai-chi class, including
Troi and Alkar) 
WORF: That will be all for today. There will be another class tomorrow
at oh seven hundred hours.
TROI: The skills are demanding. You're very disciplined.
ALKAR: I believe in a strong connection between body and mind. You
obviously share the same convictions.
TROI: Yes, I do. Only sometimes my body has a problem conforming to my
mind's wishes.
