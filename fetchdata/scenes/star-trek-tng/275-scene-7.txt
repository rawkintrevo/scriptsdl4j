PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge, what's going on?
We've lost primary helm control on the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: I don't understand it. The impulse systems suddenly cut out
and the warp drive just kicked in. 
RIKER [OC]: Geordi, can you take the engines offline? 
LAFORGE: I'm working on it. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, what's our heading? 
DATA: Bearing one eight seven mark four. I am unable to determine our
destination, however we are heading away from the Mekorda sector. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain, the computer's locked out all the propulsion

LAFORGE: Controls. I can't access any of the
overrides. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: If you want us to stop, I'll have to
do an emergency core shutdown. 
RIKER: That would leave us without warp power for more than a week. 
PICARD: Begin the procedure, Mister La Forge. 
(another jolt) 
DATA: We are no longer at warp, sir. Impulse power has resumed. All
systems show normal. 
RIKER: Where are we? 
DATA: We are approximately thirty billion kilometres from our original
position. 
PICARD: Well done, Mister La Forge.
