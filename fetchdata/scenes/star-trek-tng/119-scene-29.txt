JAKE: Aim it at Relva? I can't do that. It's crazy.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do it! 
JAKE [OC]: But I'll burn up! 
DATA: Twenty eight seconds to impact. 
PICARD: Jake, listen very carefully. This is Captain Picard and I am
giving you an order. Aim the shuttle at Relva!

[Shuttlecraft]

JAKE: Okay. It's done. 
PICARD [OC]: Good. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Now, monitor your speed exactly. When it
hits point zero two zero, I want you to restart the engine 
[Shuttlecraft]

PICARD [OC]: And when I tell you, pull up hard.
JAKE: Point zero two zero speed. Captain, I sure hope you're right. 
PICARD [OC]: You'll just have to trust me. 
JAKE: Point zero zero three. 
[Bridge]

JAKE [OC]: Zero zero nine. Zero one two.

PICARD: Restart the engine, now! Pull up hard! 
REMMICK: (amongst others) Yeah! 
RIKER: Incredible, Captain! 
REMMICK: How did he do it? I thought 
LAFORGE: He built up enough speed and then bounced her off the
atmosphere! 
PICARD: Mister Kurland, I assume you can manoeuvre it home? 
JAKE [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Do it. Then report to Mister Riker. 
JAKE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir! 
REMMICK: Very original, Captain. But how did that child acquire access
to a shuttlecraft? 
RIKER: Kurland is a highly qualified Enterprise Academy candidate,
fully trained in many areas including shuttles. 
REMMICK: And did this full training include discipline? 
PICARD: Mister Remmick, young men sometimes make rash choices. Which is
why Mister Kurland will receive a strong refresher specifically in
discipline 
REMMICK: I'll note that in my report. 
PICARD: Full cooperation, Number One.
