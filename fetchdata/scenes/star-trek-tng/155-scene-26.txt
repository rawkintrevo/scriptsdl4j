RIKER LAFORGE WORF BOCHRA PICARD PATAHK CRUSHER DATA

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Bochra. Bochra, you're in bad shape and my
vision's getting worse. Now there's a beacon out there that'll get us
back to my ship, but not if I can't find it. 
BOCHRA: I cannot surrender to the Federation. 
LAFORGE: Then stay here and die. 
BOCHRA: If the situation were reversed would you not die to avoid
capture? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I might, if I thought it was necessary. If the
stakes were high enough. But they'd have to be pretty damn high. I
guess I'd make a pretty lousy Romulan, huh? 
BOCHRA: I no more wish to die than you do. 
LAFORGE: Bochra, there are times when it is necessary to die for one's
ideals. Do you believe this is one of those times? 
(Bochra puts down the phaser) 
LAFORGE: Come on. Let's go find that beacon. Whoa! 
BOCHRA: What is it? 
LAFORGE: Everything's gone blank. I'm blind.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come. Worf. 
WORF: You are busy. Forgive my intrusion. 
RIKER: For what it's worth, I understand your bitterness. 
WORF: With respect, sir, you cannot. I am asked to give up the very
lifeblood of my mother and my father to those who murdered them. 
RIKER: Must you blame all Romulans for that? 
WORF: Yes. 
RIKER: Forever? What if some day the Federation made peace with the
Romulans. 
WORF: Impossible. 
RIKER: That's what your people said a few years ago about humans. Think
how many died on both sides in that war. Would you and I be here now
like this if we hadn't been able to let go of the anger and the blame?
Where does it end, Worf? If that Romulan dies, does his family carry
the bitterness on another generation? 
WORF: Then you believe I should? 
RIKER: What I believe doesn't matter. 
WORF: My Starfleet training tells me one thing, but everything I am
tells me another. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf, report to Sickbay. 
WORF: Acknowledged.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lieutenant, his life is coming to an end.
I thought it important for you to see him again. It's not too late to
change your mind. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PATAHK: Come close to me, Klingon. Let me die with my hands at your
throat. 
WORF: There is a substance within my cells which you need to survive. 
PATAHK: Then you've come to hear me beg for my life? 
WORF: No. 
PATAHK: I would rather die than pollute my body with Klingon filth!

[Cave]

BOCHRA: I've lost almost all feeling in my legs. 
LAFORGE: My synapses must be turning to jelly. The Visor's fine. I just
can't see a thing. 
BOCHRA: How do we locate the beacon? 
LAFORGE: We don't. 
BOCHRA: Do all humans give up so easily? 
LAFORGE: Bochra, we're lost, unless you've got something that can smell
neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: We have the sensor device you are carrying. 
LAFORGE: Tricorder? It's not set up to detect neutrinos. 
BOCHRA: Your eye device does. Connect them. 
LAFORGE: That's crazy. They don't speak the same language. Besides, I'd
never be able to get an accurate sampling. Wait a second. Wait, I
wouldn't need an
accurate sampling, just need a pointer. A neutrino Geiger counter. No,
it's still not possible. 
BOCHRA: You cannot do it? 
LAFORGE: Under normal circumstances, maybe. Here, no way. 
BOCHRA: Why? 
LAFORGE: Because I can't see. Adapting the neural output pods of the
Visor is tricky work. It can't be done by touch. 
BOCHRA: Then I will be your eyes.

[Bridge]

DATA: The storm is beginning to subside, Captain.
We should have a window in less than an hour. 
RIKER: There's still no indication that he's found the beacon, sir. 
PICARD: Assemble an away team. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
WORF: Captain, the Romulan warship has crossed the Neutral Zone border.
It is in Federation space and heading toward us. 
PICARD: Belay that order, Number One. Red alert.

[Cave]

LAFORGE: Make sure the scanner select limiter
matches the Visor output range. 
BOCHRA: Not so fast. 
LAFORGE: Now, place the neural output pods in contact with the
tricorder scanner heads. 
BOCHRA: Ready. 
LAFORGE: Let her rip. 
BOCHRA: Bearing three five zero. 
LAFORGE: We did it! The first Federation-Romulan co-venture. 
BOCHRA: The storm may be breaking. 
LAFORGE: With any luck, there'll be an electromagnetic window opening
up and we can get out of here. 
BOCHRA: At which point, I'll be your prisoner. 
LAFORGE: Can you walk? 
BOCHRA: I don't know. 
LAFORGE: Let's find out. Come on. (he hauls Bochra up) Okay, let's go. 
BOCHRA: Straight ahead. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
BOCHRA: To the right.
