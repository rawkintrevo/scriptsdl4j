GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Well done, Captain. 
PICARD: It was a team effort, Admiral. Ensign Ro was invaluable. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Good. What's the next step? 
PICARD: The Enterprise will escort a Bajoran Antares class carrier to
the Valo Three camp at oh five hundred hours. Orta and his people will
be aboard. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Good. Keep us advised of your progress. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. How's that Cardassian virus, Admiral? 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: A lot better, thank you. 
PICARD: I'm pleased. We will report as soon as our mission is
accomplished. Picard out. 
RIKER: Ensign Ro, take us to the designated coordinates. 
RO: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, keep an eye on the Cardassian border. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(later) 
WORF: The Bajoran vessel is moving up from the surface, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. Hail them, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Audio channel open. The ship does not have visual capabilities. 
PICARD: This is Captain Picard. We're prepared to escort you to Valo
Three. 
WOMAN [OC]: Acknowledged, Captain. Be advised that our ship is limited
to half impulse. 
PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo Three, half impulse. 
RO: Aye, sir. 
(after a while) 
DATA: I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space. Two
ships are moving along the border heading one four two mark zero five
one. 
PICARD: Can you identify the class of these ships, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Cardassian warships, Galor class, type three. 
RIKER: Top of the line. 
DATA: They are moving into a course parallel to our own, Captain. 
PICARD: Yellow alert. Continue to monitor them. 
RIKER: Ensign Ro, what's the closest we come to the Cardassian border
on our current heading to Valo Three? 
RO: Thirteen thousand, four hundred kilometres, sir. 
RIKER: ETA? 
RO: Eight minutes. 
PICARD: That's where it will be. 
(about eight minutes later) 
DATA: The Cardassian ships are changing course, sir. They are crossing
the border. 
WORF: They're increasing power to their forward weapon grid. 
RIKER: Red alert. 
PICARD: Ensign Ro, set a course to intercept the Cardassians. Mister
Worf, open a channel to the Bajoran vessel. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: This is the Enterprise. We are moving to intercept two
Cardassian warships. Maintain your present course and speed. 
WOMAN [OC]: Acknowledged, Enterprise. 
WORF: The Cardassians are within visual range. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: They are hailing us, sir. 
PICARD: Open a channel, Mister Worf. This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
the Federation Starship Enterprise. How can we help you? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Gul Dolak, Cardassian Militia Four One. We have
no argument with you, Captain. 
PICARD: I'm pleased to hear that, Gul Dolak, for all of us in the
Federation value the peaceful relations with our Cardassian neighbours.

GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: No more than we value the relations with our
Federation neighbours. 
PICARD: Well, now that we've established our mutual good will, what's
on your mind? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: We have identified the Bajoran ship you are
escorting as a terrorist carrier. 
PICARD: Terrorist carrier? Are you certain? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Most certain, Captain. It has committed many
crimes against us. We know its markings well. 
PICARD: Rest assured, Gul Dolak, there will be no terrorist attacks
today. We are escorting the Bajoran settlers to their camp on Valo
Three. You can monitor their course if you wish. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: We would request that you withdraw and leave the
matter to us. 
PICARD: This is neutral space, Gul Dolak. You have no jurisdiction
here. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Nor do you. 
PICARD: If we withdraw, what do you intend to do with the Bajoran
vessel? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: We intend to destroy it. 
PICARD: I see. That puts me in a difficult position. I promised to
escort these people to their camps. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: You are protecting the enemies of the Cardassian
people. If you do not withdraw, we will take great offence. 
PICARD: I'm sorry to offend you, Gul Dolak, but we cannot withdraw. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: We are prepared to take any steps necessary. 
PICARD: Is that intended as a threat? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: It is a complaint from your Cardassian
neighbours. You have one hour to withdraw. 
(transmission ends) 
PICARD: Advise Starfleet of our status, Mister Data. When Admiral
Kennelly calls, I'll speak to him in my Ready room.
