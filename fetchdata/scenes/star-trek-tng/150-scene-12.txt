(It's busy. They've even got Guy sitting on a bed.
Doctor Stubbs is lying prone, being treated) 
NURSE: Lay down carefully. There you go. 
WESLEY: Doctor Stubbs, the captain asked me to tell you that our
systems are back to normal, and we can try another launch attempt as
soon as you're ready. 
STUBBS: Quite a dynamic family team, you Crushers. 
CRUSHER: Well, it's nice to be together again. I was at Starfleet
Medical for a year. I missed about two inches of him. 
STUBBS: I'm not sure I'd want my mother to be flying through space with
me. No, I take that back. I am sure. I wouldn't want her. My mother is
a formidable woman, too. A woman of letters. A great critic. 
WESLEY: I know. 
STUBBS: Good Lord, son. You didn't read that unauthorised biography? Is
this all this boy does, Doctor? Fly the ship and read? Doesn't he ever
have any fun? 
CRUSHER: Sure he does. 
WESLEY: Actually, most of my free time is taken up with my studies. I'm
trying to get into Starfleet Academy, and I earn credits for the time
spent on the Enterprise, but it's just not the same. 
NURSE: Are you ready to sit up? 
STUBBS: Well. I am whole again. Thank you, Doctor. Come along, Wesley.
Let's go see if Humpty Dumpty is still in one piece. 
(Stubbs and Wesley leave, and Beverly goes to investigate the sound of
running liquid. A food dispenser is overflowing a glass) 
CRUSHER: Computer, fix the food slot. 
COMPUTER: The food slot is functioning properly. 
CRUSHER: Well, check again. 
COMPUTER: The food slot is functioning properly. 
CRUSHER: Computer, deactivate food slot.
