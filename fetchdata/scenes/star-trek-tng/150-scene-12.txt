[Computer core]

STUBBS: Gentlemen. I need a computer that is one
hundred percent in less than eight hours, and we still have core
reconstruction to consider. 
WESLEY: We're trying low gamma bursts. We think it might slow down
their productivity. 
STUBBS: Have you considered a high level charge? 
DATA: High level gamma radiation would kill them, Doctor. 
STUBBS: I know. 
(So he fires something at a computer wall panel)

[Ready room]

PICARD: I can't get the story of Gulliver out of my
head. Overpowered by Lilliputians. How long do we have to wait? 
RIKER: We can continue to bypass the part of the computer that's
affected, but if the nanites are spreading through the whole the ship. 
PICARD: Do you smell a change? What? (coughs) 
[Bridge]

(The Bridge is filling with opaque gas) 
PICARD: Picard to La Forge. We have an environmental system malfunction
on the Bridge. Acknowledge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Nitrogen oxide. Toxic levels.
LAFORGE [OC]: Working on it, Captain. 
(The air clears) 
RIKER: I've switched to manual control of the air handling system. 
(The lights go out, a panel explodes. Stubbs, Worf and Data enter) 

PICARD: Mister Worf, report. 
WORF: He entered a computer access room and sterilised one of the
processors with gamma radiation. 
DATA: The nanites in the upper core are all dead, Captain. 
STUBBS: You have no choice now. It is a matter of survival. 
PICARD: Doctor Stubbs, if you were a member of my crew, sir, I would 
STUBBS: But I am not a member of your crew, sir. I am a representative
of the highest command of the Federation, which has directed you to
perform my experiment. 
PICARD: If any man, woman or child on this ship is harmed as a result
of your experiment, I will have your head before the highest command in
the Federation. 
STUBBS: Good Lord, you are talking about machines with a screw loose.
Simply turn them off and be done with them. 
DATA: Doctor Stubbs, your own actions have provided evidence to the
contrary. When you destroyed the nanites in the core, they responded by
interfering with our life support systems. It is difficult to accept
these as random actions by machines with loose screws. In effect, you
may have proven that the nanites do have a collective intelligence. 
WORF: Captain, the ship is at risk. Extermination may be our only
alternative. 
STUBBS: A good point. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf, I want Doctor Stubbs confined to his quarters
until further notice. 
(Stubbs leaves with a guard, and the light come back) 
PICARD: Mister Data, can you find me some way to communicate with these
things? 
DATA: With intelligence, there is the capability of language, but it
will depend on how far their evolution has brought them. We could
modify the circuitry in the universal translator to make it capable of
communications with them. 
PICARD: Proceed.
