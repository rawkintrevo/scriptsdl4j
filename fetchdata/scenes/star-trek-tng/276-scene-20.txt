PICARD RO DATA WORF KALITA

[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, I am scanning the area from which the
distress signal was sent, but I am unable to detect a vessel. 
WORF: Captain, the computer has detected a piggyback communication on
the last distress signal. 
PICARD: Can you decode it? 
WORF: It will take a few moments. 
PICARD: Do it.

[Ro's ship]

RO: The Enterprise shields have a weak point. When
the ship is at impulse, the thrust destabilises the shield
configuration right at this point. (between the nacelles) I'm going to
try to punch through there. 
KALITA: Won't they detect us? 
RO: They'll know something's penetrated the shields. With all the
interference it'll take them a few seconds to find us. We'll have to
beam the medical supplies aboard and get out fast. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The message is difficult to decode.
Interference has garbled much of the transmission, but it seems to be
from Lieutenant Ro. 
PICARD: Ro is on that ship? 
DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft
shields. 
PICARD: Let it through.

[Ro's ship]

RO: We're going to make it. All right, we're in. 
KALITA: Energising. 
(their hold is filled up) 
RO: Let's get out of here.
