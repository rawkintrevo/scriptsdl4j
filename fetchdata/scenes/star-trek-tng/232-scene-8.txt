Q PICARD DATA

[Ready room]

Q: Well, there, that's better. Crusher gets more
shrill with each passing year. 
PICARD: Q, what is it you really want? 
Q: Well, since you know so much about the Q, I thought you'd the
perfect person to introduce me to the child. Let her know she can trust
me. 
PICARD: I don't trust you, Q. Why should I expect Amanda to? 
Q: Well she'd better, because I'm all she's got. She needs me to help
her prepare for her future with the Q. 
PICARD: But what if she doesn't want that future? It must be her
decision. 
Q: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Do you think she'll want to remain an enfeebled
mortal? 
PICARD: But if she really is Q, she must understand what that means.
Very well, I will introduce you. But we cannot argue like this in front
of her. We must at least appear to be 
Q: Pals? 
PICARD: Civil. 
Q: I knew I could count on you, Jean-Luc.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, I want you to access any
available records on Amanda Rogers. 
DATA: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: I want to know about her biological parents, about their death.
I find it odd that any Q could die in an accident. 
DATA: It is not consistent with what we know of them, sir. 
PICARD: I'm convinced that Q isn't telling us everything. See what you
can find out. 
DATA: Aye, sir.
