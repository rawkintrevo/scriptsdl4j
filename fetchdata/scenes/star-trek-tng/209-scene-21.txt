[Engineering]

DATA: Target one is emitting two thousand cubic
metres per second. 
[Penthara Science lab]

DATA [OC]: Target two, one thousand six hundred. 
MOSELEY: Surface wind patterns over the target are stable. 
LAFORGE: You picking up anything at altitude, Data? 
[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: CO2 concentrations remain unchanged at
upper elevations. 
(three more phaser shots, then Rasmussen enters) 
RASMUSSEN: Have I missed much? 
WORF: Target fourteen complete, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: What have you got? 
DATA: No change, sir. 
[Pentara Science lab]

RIKER [OC]: How are the surface winds, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Holding steady, sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The computer has stopped drilling. 
RIKER: You should be getting something

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Now, Data. 
DATA: Elevated CO2 levels at twenty kilometres, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Now you're

LAFORGE: Talking. We've got some new temperatures
coming in. 
MOSELEY: All thermal monitoring stations are reporting no further
temperature drops. 
LAFORGE: Correction, Doctor. Two equatorial stations are showing slight
increases. 
MOSELEY: Thank you. Thank you all. You've given us what we need. Time.
