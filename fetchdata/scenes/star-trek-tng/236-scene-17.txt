RIKER WORF JELLICO TROI PICARD CRUSHER

[Bridge]

RIKER: Gul Lemec has arrived. He's waiting for you
in the Observation Lounge. 
JELLICO: Very good. I'll be in my Ready room.

[Ready room]

(the wall behind the desk is now decorated with
frames pictures from his son) 
JELLICO: Yes? 
TROI: Captain, I think there's been a slight miscommunication. Did you
want to meet with Gul Lemec in here? 
JELLICO: No. The Observation Lounge is appropriate. 
TROI: I see. 
JELLICO: Lemec is a Cardassian, and Cardassians are like timber wolves,
predators, bold in large numbers cautious by themselves, and with an
instinctive need to establish a dominant position in any social
gathering. 
TROI: So you're trying to establish a dominant position by making him
wait for you. The trouble with wolves is that sometimes the fight for
dominance, one of them ends up dead. 
JELLICO: In that case, the trick is to be the wolf that's still
standing at the end.

[Precipice]

CRUSHER: The floor is over five hundred metres down
from here. 
PICARD: There doesn't seem to be a way around. We'll have to rappel
from here. This is sheer granite. We'll have to use fusing pitons. 
CRUSHER: We could try to find another way down. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, that would take several hours. We don't have the
time. 
WORF: You're not afraid of heights, are you, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Of course not. 
(They get into their harnesses and secure the lines) 
PICARD: Now, remember to control your descent and don't get the lines
tangled. 
CRUSHER: I'll remember. 
PICARD: All right?
