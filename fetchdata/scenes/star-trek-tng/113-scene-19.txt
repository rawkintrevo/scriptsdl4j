[Police station]

(Crusher is continuing to try and imitate the other
women, this time by powdering her nose. The Desk Sergeant is enjoying
the view) 
CRUSHER: Something on your mind? 
SERGEANT: Yeah, nut I'm not sure it can be repeated in mixed company.
(he offers her gum) You're a pretty hep lookin' broad. 
CRUSHER: Is that good? 
SERGEANT: It ain't bad. You like Tommy Dorsey? (she nods) I got two
tickets for the dance tomorrow night. 
(Crusher swallows the gum) 
[Outside Holodeck]

RIKER: Have you tried the intercom? 
LAFORGE: Yes. 
RIKER: Riker to holodeck. Riker to holodeck! 
(Wesley takes a piece of equipment and uses it to 'look' at the
holodeck controls) 
RIKER: Are you seeing anything? 
WESLEY: No, sir. 
RIKER: What can I do? 
LAFORGE: Not a thing. We have to go through this millimetre by
millimetre. 
RIKER: All right. Get it fixed. 
LAFORGE: Easy, Wes. Slow it down. If there's an anomaly, you could go
right past it, okay? 
[Interrogation room]

MCNARY: Okay, Dix, we're cutting you loose. 
PICARD: That's welcome news. 
BELL: You better not try to leave town. 
PICARD: If I leave town, the town leaves with me. I get the feeling
your friend doesn't like me. 
MCNARY: We know you're dealing with Redblock, Dixon. Take it from a
friend, it doesn't help your case. 
PICARD: Redblock? I'll keep it in mind. Thank you for helping me. 
(Takes a cigarette, inhales and coughs) 
MCNARY: Forget it. Hey, Dix, when are you coming over for supper? The
kids'd love to see you, and you know how much you love Sharon's
cooking. 
PICARD: Soon, my friend. For the moment, I have other duties. 
MCNARY: Blonde or brunette? 
PICARD: She's a lady, all right, and her name is Enterprise. 
MCNARY: Sounds like a working girl to me. I'll stop by the office with
a bottle of scotch. You can tell me all about her.
