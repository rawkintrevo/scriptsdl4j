RIKER LAFORGE WORF SHELBY PICARD TROI WESLEY COMPUTER CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: All critical subcommands are protected,
Captain. 
SHELBY: Then it's over.
RIKER: Mister Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You
heard me. A collision course.
WESLEY: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Mister La Forge, prepare to go to warp power. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Data's lab]

PICARD: Sleep.
CRUSHER: He's regaining consciousness. 
PICARD: Sleep.
TROI: It is Captain Picard speaking, not Locutus.
PICARD: Sleep, Data.
CRUSHER: He's exhausted.
DATA: Yes, Doctor, but if I may make a supposition, I do not believe
his message was intended to express fatigue but to suggest a course of
action.

[Bridge]

WORF: Borg cutting beam activated. 
RIKER: Mister Crusher? Engage. 
DATA [OC]: Data to Bridge. Stand by. 
RIKER: Stand by, all stations. 
[Data's lab]

DATA: I am attempting to penetrate the Borg
regenerative subcommand path. It is a low priority system and may be
accessible. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Outer hull breach.
WORF: Sir, shall I execute evacuation sequence? 
RIKER: Negative, Mister Worf. Mister Data, your final report. 
DATA [OC]: Stand by. 
RIKER: I can't, Mister Data. 
COMPUTER: Warning. Inner hull failure imminent on decks twenty three,
twenty four, and twenty five. Decompression danger. 
(Then suddenly it all goes quiet. No shaking, no cutting) 
RIKER: Mister Data, what the hell happened?

[Data's lab]

DATA: I successfully planted a command into the
Borg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe it
was time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep.

[Bridge]

RIKER: To sleep? 
DATA [OC]: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Status of Borg power drive?
WORF: Minimal power. 
RIKER: Electromagnetic field?
WORF: Nonexistent.
RIKER: Commander Shelby, take an away team and confirm that the Borg
are asleep.
SHELBY: Delighted, sir. Mister Worf. 
[Borg ship]

(She arrives with Worf and a security guard) 
SHELBY: Shelby to Enterprise. It's true. They're all in a regeneration
mode.

[Corridor]

SHELBY [OC]: They're dormant, sir. 
RIKER: Any indication to how long we can keep them like this?

[Borg ship]

SHELBY: Checking. 
WORF: Tricorder readings are fluctuating rapidly, Commander. 
SHELBY: Shelby to Enterprise. There are indications here that their
entire power net's about to feed back on itself. I'd say we're looking
at a self-destruct sequence activated by the Borg's malfunction. Do you
want us to attempt to disarm it?

[Data's lab]

RIKER: Stand by. 
CRUSHER: There's no way to know what the destruction of the Borg ship
will do to him. 
DATA: We should also consider the advantages of further examination of
the Borg and their vessel, sir.
RIKER: I don't think so. Data, separate yourself from Captain Picard.
Away Team, get yourselves home. Mister Crusher, upon their return move
us to a safe position.
WESLEY [OC]: Aye, sir. 
(and Enterprise whizzes away as the cube starts to spark and fizz.
Picard staggers. Then - Ka-BOOM!!!) 
CRUSHER: Life signs are stable. The DNA around the microcircuit fibre
implants is returning to normal. 
TROI: How do you feel?
PICARD: Almost human. With just a bit of a headache. 
CRUSHER: We'll get you to Sickbay. We won't have any trouble getting
these implants out now.
RIKER: How much do you remember?
PICARD: Everything. Including some brilliantly unorthodox strategy from
a former first officer of mine.
