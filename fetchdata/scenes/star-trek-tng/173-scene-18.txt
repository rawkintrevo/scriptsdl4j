don doc alarm baz inducer controls cell booth pain

[Sickbay - room four]

(John has a big golden moment, and the alarm
sounds) 
TEMPLE: Doctor Crusher, medical emergency, room four. 
JOHN: I can't make it stop. 
CRUSHER: John, tell me. Is it worse than before? 
JOHN: Much worse. 
TEMPLE: Should I get something for the pain? 
CRUSHER: No. The readings are fluctuating too wildly. Besides, it
wouldn't do any good. His entire cell structure is transforming. 
JOHN: I have to leave, Beverly. 
CRUSHER: John, where do you have to go? 
JOHN: I must get off this ship. 
CRUSHER: That's impossible. Not in your condition. 
JOHN: I must! 
(another big moment, and he runs out the door)

[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Security.

[Shuttlebay]

(Two engineers are working on the El-Baz) 
LAFORGE: Okay, let's realign the magnetic inducer on the starboard
nacelle. 
(John appears in the control gallery. Beverly, Worf and two guards
enter the main bay) 
CRUSHER: John! 
WORF: Leave the control booth immediately! 
(Worf goes up to the gallery as John succeeds in opening the bay doors)

CRUSHER: John, listen to me. You must come down. I'll try to help you. 
WORF: Step away from the controls. 
JOHN: Get back. Please, stay away. 
WORF: I have no wish to harm you, but you must return to Sickbay
immediately. 
JOHN: No. Do not come any closer. I cannot control over what is
happening to me. 
(There is a massive golden glow that is bigger than John and pushes
Worf over the railing) 
CRUSHER: His neck is broken. No life signs. Sickbay, form a
resuscitation team. I have a code seven in shuttlebay two. Transporter
room, stand by. 
SECURITY: Hold it. 
CRUSHER: No, don't. 
(John has come down. He sends a glow through Worf, who comes back to
life) 
CRUSHER: Hold still. 
LAFORGE: Doc. 
CRUSHER: I can't believe it. There's no trace of injury.
