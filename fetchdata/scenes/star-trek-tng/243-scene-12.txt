[Compound]

(Worf looks everyone in the eye then stands in
front of the wall for the firing squad.) 
GUEST0: I know that there are those among you who may question what I'm
about to do. And you would not be wrong to do so. I have questioned
myself. I have spent the night considering my decision, challenging
myself to justify whether it is right. And I have reached the
conclusion that it is absolutely necessary to put this man to death.
What we have built together would be destroyed by this man. And I
cannot allow that to happen. I give you one last chance to accept our
way of life. 
WORF: Those are eloquent word, Tokath, but the truth is, I am being
executed because I brought something dangerous to your young people.
Knowledge. Knowledge of their origins. Knowledge of the real reasons
you are here in this camp. The truth is a threat to you. 
GUEST0: Enough. Stand ready. Raise your weapons. 
BA'EL: Father. 
GUEST5: Stop this! 
(Toq is wearing the old armour.) 
GUEST5: If you kill him, you will have to kill me. 
GUEST0: Step aside, Toq. 
GUEST5: Worf would rather die than accept this way of life. And so would
I. I want to leave, as do many others. You will have to kill us to keep
us here. 
WORF: You see, Tokath? It is already too late. 
GUEST0: I am warning you. Move aside, now. 
(Toq holds his ground) 
GUEST0: Stand ready. 
L'KOR: Toq. Move away. 
GUEST0: Take aim. 
(L'Kor goes and stands with Toq and Worf. Tokath draws his own weapon.
Other young people join the group. Finally Ba'el stands with Worf.) 
GUEST0: Ba'el. 
GI'RAL: Tokath. Long ago, when your captives asked to stay here, our
hope was to avoid dishonouring our children on the Home World. But
perhaps, over the years, we lost sight of our children that we raised
here. This is our prison. It should not be theirs. 
WORF: Years ago, your parents made a great sacrifice for the sake of
their families. Today, they do so again. For that, we must honour them.
You must promise them never reveal to their secret. No one must know of
this place. 
GUEST5: A supply ship's due in a few days. They will take us. When they
arrive, Tokath will explain it to them. Then we will start a new life. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Our search for
Lieutenant Worf was cut short when we
received a cryptic message from him requesting a rendezvous with a
Romulan vessel. He has informed us we will be taking on passengers.
