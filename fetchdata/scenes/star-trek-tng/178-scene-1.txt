[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is in casual clothes, packing a case) 
TROI: So, where have you decided to go? 
PICARD: Hmm? What? Oh, er, France. Labarre. My home village. 
TROI: Really? 
PICARD: Yes. It's the first time in almost twenty years. 
TROI: Interesting. 
PICARD: Counsellor. 
TROI: I just find it interesting. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, the man who
couldn't be pried out of his seat for a vacation for three years 
PICARD: It's Earth. It's home. Do I need another reason? 
TROI: I don't know. What do you think? 
PICARD: Your help has been invaluable during my recovery, but, look,
I'm better. The injuries are healing. 
TROI: Those you can see in the mirror. 
PICARD: The nightmares have ended. All I need now is a little time to
myself. 
TROI: I agree. In fact, I'm delighted you're going. It's just that the
choice of where you're going could stand some scrutiny. 
PICARD: If you wish to believe that my going home is a direct result of
being held captive by the Borg, be my guest. 
TROI: Is that what you believe? 
PICARD: I hate it when you do that. 
TROI: Captain, you do need time. You cannot achieve complete recovery
so quickly. And it's perfectly normal, after what you've been through,
to spend a great deal of time trying to find yourself again. 
PICARD: And what better place to find oneself than on the streets of
one's home village. 
TROI: Interesting. Have a good trip, Captain. 
(She kisses his cheek and leaves him to his packing. He decides against
some books, takes a final look around and walks out)
