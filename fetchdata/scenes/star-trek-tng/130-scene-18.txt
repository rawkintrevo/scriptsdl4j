[Engineering]

OKONA: You're quite a craftsman, Lieutenant La
Forge. How soon? 
LAFORGE: What's the rush? I thought you liked it here. 
OKONA: I did. It stopped liking me. Time to disappear. 
WESLEY: Where will you go? 
OKONA: What? 
WESLEY: I said, where will you go? 
OKONA: A new place, if I make it. 
WESLEY: Don't you ever stay anywhere? 
OKONA: Not for long. 
WESLEY: I couldn't be like that. 
OKONA: Oh? 
WESLEY: I mean, always being alone. Commander Riker says you choose to
live the way you do and you like it. 
OKONA: Is that what he says? 
WESLEY: Yeah. It would be difficult for me to be leaving all the time.
I'd miss my friends, the people I love. I guess leaving's gotten easy
for you. 
OKONA: I seem to have a way of using up a place. 
WESLEY: I wasn't talking about a place. 
OKONA: I know. I know what you were talking about.
LAFORGE: It's ready. You should be able to install this in roughly five
minutes. 
OKONA: Like you said, Geordi, what's the rush? I have some friends
around here. I think it's time to make a stand.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Okona. 
OKONA: Captain, I've decided not to leave. 
PICARD: Oh. 
OKONA: Don't worry, I'm not staying either. 
PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? 
OKONA: I've decided to surrender myself. 
RIKER: To which one? 
OKONA: There's really only one option. 
PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is very
distracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and we
resolve this face to face. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: Excellent. 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Agreed. 
RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would you
accompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests.

WORF: Aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]

(The fathers and children are beamed aboard
together) 
ROBINSON: They have no weapons. 
WORF: This way.
