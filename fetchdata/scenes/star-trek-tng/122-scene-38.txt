(The team are not watching when Armus leaves the
shuttlecraft and approaches them. Riker is grabbed by an invisible
force and dragged by the feet to the slick) 
RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! 
ARMUS: Touch him and he dies. 
RIKER: No! No, don't! 
(Riker disappears into the slick) 
DATA: Enterprise?

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. 
PICARD: I'm beaming you up. 
[Planet surface]

ARMUS: If any of you leave now, he dies. 
[Bridge]

ARMUS [OC]: And so do the survivors of the crash. 
(Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) 
Captain's log, supplemental. There is grave danger
to the crew on Vagra Two. My first officer is missing, attacked by this
entity known as Armus.

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, perhaps you should look at this. We
have the chart of the energy field surrounding the shuttle. 
PICARD: There are a great deal of fluctuations. 
WORF: Yes, but there is a pattern. Here is when it killed Lieutenant
Yar, and here is when it absorbed Commander Riker. 
PICARD: And here, here, where the energy is lowest? 
WORF: Both times it had enveloped the shuttle. 
PICARD: It has something to do with Counsellor Troi. Somehow when it's
dealing with her, the energy field is affected. I want to talk to her.
I'm going to beam down. Lieutenant Worf, you have the conn. 
[Shuttlecraft]

(Armus, and presumably Riker, are draped over the
craft again)
TROI: Imzadi! No! Please, stop hurting him! 
ARMUS [OC]: He resists. If he would give himself over, the pain would
diminish. He struggles. You should feel his strength. 
TROI: I can. 
ARMUS [OC]: Should I let him go? 
TROI: You only ask to torment me. 
ARMUS [OC]: Perhaps. 
TROI: How should I answer? What can I offer except myself? 
ARMUS [OC]: And would you give yourself for him? Would you give that
much? 
TROI: Yes. Without hesitation. 
ARMUS [OC]: Just for him? 
TROI: No, not just for him. I would do the same for any of the others.
Armus, you have me. Let them go. 
ARMUS [OC]: Perhaps. Ah, another has arrived. 
[Planet surface]

(Picard is with the team. Armus slithers over to
them) 
ARMUS: You are the one in charge? 
PICARD: (to Data) Is Commander Riker alive? 
ARMUS: Answer, Tin Man. 
DATA: I would guess that death is no longer sufficient entertainment to
alleviate its boredom. Therefore, Commander Riker is alive. 
ARMUS: Maybe. Don't you want to ask me what I want? 
PICARD: No. 
ARMUS: Not even to protect your own existence? 
PICARD: I want to see my people in the shuttle. 
ARMUS: Entertain me. (Picard shakes his head) Then I will do it myself.
You, Tin Man. 
(Data moves jerkily, and points his phaser at Beverly, then Picard) 
ARMUS: Now tell me, how would you feel if you were the instrument of
death for your leader? 
PICARD: Don't struggle, Data. 
DATA: I have no control over what you do with the phaser. Therefore, I
would not be the instrument of his death. 
ARMUS: Perhaps killing the Doctor would engender more feeling? 
DATA: No, the control is still yours. 
ARMUS: And what about you, Doctor? Are you ready to die? Tell me you
are not afraid. 
CRUSHER: I am afraid. 
ARMUS: Beg me to spare you. 
CRUSHER: No. 
ARMUS: One of you is going to die, and you, Doctor, get to choose. You
don't like that, do you? 
CRUSHER: Then I choose myself. 
ARMUS: No. You are going to live. One of them dies. 
(Data's arm swings around and ends pointing the phaser at his own head)

ARMUS: Maybe this one. Though I would not call it death, since he is
only a device. Tell me, Tin Man, how does it feel to face your own
extinction. 
DATA: Curious. (the phaser drops) You are capable of great sadism and
cruelty. Interesting. No redeeming qualities. 
ARMUS: So what do you think? 
DATA: I think you should be destroyed. 
ARMUS: A moral judgment from a machine. 
PICARD: Data. Armus, we're finished dealing with you. 
ARMUS: I have your man in here, and the others in the shuttle. 
PICARD: It doesn't matter. We will no longer be a source of amusement. 
ARMUS: I can kill them. 
PICARD: Yes. You can. But only I can command them. They follow my
orders. 
ARMUS: Have them amuse me. 
PICARD: Only if you let me see my people on the shuttle first. I must
see them. 
ARMUS: Not possible. 
PICARD: Then our business with you is concluded. 
ARMUS: And you claim you care about your comrades. 
PICARD: I care. Which is why I must see them. 
ARMUS: You want to see your people? Then, here. Look at this one. 
(Riker is tossed out of the slick, covered in oil) 
CRUSHER: He's alive. Don't move. 
PICARD: Is he all right? 
CRUSHER: All signs show normal. 
RIKER: So much frustration. It had to get rid of me. 
PICARD: Now, let me see the others. 
ARMUS: No. 
PICARD: I will not allow my people to entertain you until you do. 
ARMUS: They are incapable of entertaining me. 
PICARD: I want the four of you out of here. Enterprise, beam up the
away team immediately. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: They're no longer involved. This is between you and me. 
ARMUS: They may leave. 
(The team are beamed away) 
PICARD: Now. 
ARMUS: I want to leave this place. 
PICARD: You want me to give you transportation? 
ARMUS: For which I will trade you lives. 
PICARD: I must see my people in the shuttle. 
ARMUS: Will you give me what I want? 
PICARD: I have the means. But first I must see my people. 
ARMUS: If you must.
