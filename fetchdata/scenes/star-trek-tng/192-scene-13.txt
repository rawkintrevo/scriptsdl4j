LAFORGE PICARD COMPUTER HICKMAN CRUSHER DATA SUSANNA

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: This is one of Susanna's altered skin
cells, and this is one of the alien cells Data found. 
PICARD: They're almost identical. How do you explain that? 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, I think the people from Tarchannen Three who
disappeared weren't abducted. I think they were transformed into
another species. 
LAFORGE: Can you stop it, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: The T-cell stimulator will slow the rate of change, but until
I find the cause. 
PICARD: Is the Enterprise at risk? 
CRUSHER: No. I checked the cell wall integrity. It's viability is
extremely low. I don't think it's possible for Susanna to transmit it. 
LAFORGE: Then how did she get it? 
CRUSHER: I wish I knew. The only thing I do know, Geordi, is that it's
very possible that you'll be next. 
LAFORGE: But I had two full bioscans today. You said I was fine. 
CRUSHER: I gave Susanna a bioscan, too. I didn't find anything wrong
with her, either. 
LAFORGE: How long? 
CRUSHER: Brevelle was sick for days before he left. Mendez was normal
an hour before she disappeared. You may have weeks or very few hours. 
LAFORGE: Then there's not much time to waste. I should get back to
work. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, until I know what we're dealing with, I think you
should stay here, in Sickbay. 
LAFORGE: Doctor, you said it would help if you knew the source of this.
If I can continue my analysis of the mission records, I might find an
answer. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, what if you begin to change? What if you feel
compelled to go down to the planet like the others? 
LAFORGE: Programme the computer to monitor my movements. That way we
can be sure that I don't leave the ship. What would you do, Captain?
Would you sit it out here in Sickbay or try to learn what it is that's
got you and maybe stop it? 
PICARD: Very well, Mister La Forge. You proceed with your
investigation, but I want you to report to Doctor Crusher for a bioscan
at the start of day watch. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
CRUSHER: And Geordi, if you have symptoms of any kind, I want to know
immediately. 
LAFORGE: Understood.

[Engineering]

HICKMAN [on monitor]: One to transport. 
SUSANNA [on monitor]: I want to make another sweep of the perimeter. La
Forge, you start at building four. Mendez and Brevelle begin at two.
I'll take five. 
(and the log ends) 
LAFORGE: All right, computer. Analyse audio elements from time index
fourteen four seven to fifteen five eight. List all anomalies. 
COMPUTER: No audio anomalies present. 
LAFORGE: Any subspace projections, z-particle emissions,
interferometric frequencies? 
COMPUTER: No subspace projections present. No z-particle emissions
present. No interferometric patterns present. 
LAFORGE: Damn. 
DATA: Geordi. May I inquire how your investigation is proceeding? 
LAFORGE: It's not. 
DATA: Have you attempted an audio analysis? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Data. And a spectrographic analysis, and a screen for
ionising radiation. I even ran an enhancement for micro-seismic
disturbances. I've tried it all, okay? I'm sorry, Data. 
DATA: There is no need for an apology. Perhaps if you indulged in a
brief rest period, you would be able to approach this problem with a
fresh point of view. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, you're probably right, Data, but I've got to keep
scanning these records while I can. 
DATA: May I can assist you? 
LAFORGE: If I knew what I was looking for. Rally, Data, I think it's
just a matter of me going over it, maybe finding something I forgot.
I'll let you know if I come across anything, all right? All right,
computer, one more time.
