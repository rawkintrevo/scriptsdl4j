RIKER K'MTAR WORF
ago sure attempt assassination commander warn matter sisters trust

[Observation lounge]

WORF: He is gin'tak to the house of Mogh. 
RIKER: Gin'tak? 
WORF: An advisor so trusted that he is become part of a family. 
RIKER: Do you have any idea who was behind the attack? 
K'MTAR: It is a Klingon matter. It is not your concern. 
RIKER: One of my officers was almost killed. That makes it my concern. 
K'MTAR: Recently, rumours began to circulate on the homeworld that an
assassination attempt was going to be made on the family of Mogh. Kurn
sent me here to make sure nothing happened to Worf. 
RIKER: Why didn't you warn him before the attack was made? 
K'MTAR: I tried to contact him over subspace. I was told he was not
aboard. I decided to beam directly to the surface. 
RIKER: Why didn't you let us know about it? 
K'MTAR: Forgive me for being blunt, Commander, but when it comes to
protecting the house to which I have pledged my life, I trust no one. 
WORF: I have full confidence in the officers with whom I serve. One of
the attackers dropped this dagger. The design represents the house of
Duras. 
K'MTAR: We have other evidence that indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa
and B'Etor, were behind the attack. 
RIKER: What do you think they were after? 
K'MTAR: Kurn's seat on the Council, of course. 
WORF: We can not allow their attack on our house to go unanswered. 
K'MTAR: First, we must to find them. 
RIKER: At one point they were at Deep Space Nine, trying to sell
bilitrium explosives. 
K'MTAR: That was months ago. No one knows where they went from there. 
RIKER: Maybe we can find them. We've arranged for quarters on the ship,
if you'd like to stay. 
K'MTAR: I would. Worf and I have much to discuss.
