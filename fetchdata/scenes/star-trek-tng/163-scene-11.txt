CASTILLO: I just can't quite make myself believe
it. Twenty two years! 
TASHA: I'm reading forty percent on forward shields. What do you have
on aft? 
CASTILLO: Forty percent. 
TASHA: That won't cut it. Commander, advise Lieutenant La Forge that
shields are below minimum. 
RIKER: Acknowledged. 
CASTILLO: We'll never see our homes again. Our families. 
TASHA: How do you know your family's not still alive? 
CASTILLO: You're right, I don't. But imagine coming home after
twenty-two years. Would I even recognise them? 
TASHA: What are the stats on main phaser banks? 
CASTILLO: Emitters available, sixty percent forward, fifty two percent
aft. 
TASHA: Good. Let's take a look at the torpedo launchers. 
CASTILLO: I guess I'm lucky to be alive at all. 
TASHA: You may not like the future. It's been a long war. The
Federation has lost more than half of Starfleet to the Klingons. 
CASTILLO: We were negotiating a peace treaty when I left. 
TASHA: A lot of changes, Lieutenant. A lot of changes. 
CASTILLO: When we get a break, maybe you could fill me in on some of
them. 
TASHA: Photon banks are depleted. Auxiliary fusion generators are down.

DATA: There is a high degree of probability that
the temporal rift is symmetrical, Captain. 
PICARD: Then what would happen if the Enterprise C were to fly back
through it? 
DATA: Back, sir? The Enterprise C would emerge in her own time period
at almost the same instant she left. 
PICARD: Right in the middle of the battle with the Romulans. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Is there any possibility she could survive?
DATA: None, sir. 
PICARD: Then sending them back would be a death sentence.

CREWWOMAN [OC]: Lieutenant Barrett to
communications. 
TASHA: She was the first Galaxy Class warship built by the Federation.
Forty two decks. Capable of transporting over six thousand troops. 
CASTILLO: How long have you been on board? 
TASHA: Four years. Straight out of the Academy. I was lucky to get the
Enterprise. 
CASTILLO: Yeah, me too. I mean, my Enterprise.
