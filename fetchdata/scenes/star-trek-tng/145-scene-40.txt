RIKER ANTEDEANS PICARD TROI PULASKI LWAXANA

[Sickbay]

ANTEDEANS: Food. Food. Food. Food. Food. 
PULASKI: Worf, the vermicula. 
(The barrel is opened, and the two fishy aliens almost dive in head
first) 
PULASKI: Pulaski to Captain Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor. 
PULASKI [OC]: Our passengers are on their feet. 
[Rex's Bar]

PICARD: Understood. 
RIKER: I'd better get to the Bridge. 
PICARD: What's their condition? 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Hungry. Would you like to be shown to your
rooms? 
[Rex's Bar]

PICARD: Are you coming, Mrs. Troi? 
LWAXANA: Not just yet. Tell William I'm sorry, but Rex and I are
getting married. 
PICARD: Mrs. Troi, your government expects us to deliver you to the
conference on time, and that's what I intend to do. 
LWAXANA: Pity. Duty calls, darling. But I'll be back for you later. 
PICARD: Mrs. Troi, there is something you ought to know about Rex. 
LWAXANA: Oh? 
[Corridor]

(Exiting a turbolift) 
LWAXANA: Imagine, allowing me to go on like that with that man, who
doesn't even exist. 
TROI: But you always say you like surprises, Mother.
