week longer sit starts peering chaos things inhabited civilisation

CRUSHER: His vital signs are holding. They've been
stable ever since the beam was restored. 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker, we've started to receive telemetry from the
probe we launched. 
RIKER: Go ahead. 
LAFORGE: We've charted the alien probe's radiation trail for over one
light year. 
RIKER: Any way to extrapolate am origin? 
LAFORGE: Looks like a star system in the Silarian sector. Kataan. 
RIKER: Never heard of it. Data? 
DATA: It is an unmapped system of six planets, sir. 
RIKER: Any of them inhabited? 
DATA: Not any longer, sir. The star went nova. All life in the system
was destroyed approximately one thousand years ago.

(more years have past. Eline is old and grey,
whilst Picard is still peering into his refractor telescope) 
ELINE: I put away your shoes for you again. 
PICARD: Yes, thank you, dear. 
ELINE: You know, I've been looking through this thing off and on for
over thirty years, and I still don't see what you and Meribor find so
fascinating. 
PICARD: Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down and have a rest like you're
supposed to. 
ELINE: You treat me like some frail flower. People have surgery all the
time. 
(flute music starts up) 
ELINE: He loves playing. He's quite good at it, don't you think? 
PICARD: He loves doing a lot of things too many. Last week, all he
wanted to do was be a botanist. The week before that, a sculptor. I
wish he could find some focus in his life. 
ELINE: I think he has. Maybe you should talk to him. 
PICARD: Batai? 
BATAI JR: Father? 
PICARD: I get the feeling from your mother that you have something to
tell me. 
BATAI JR: Yes. I was waiting for the right moment, but that will never
come. I'm leaving school. 
PICARD: Leaving school? No, you're not. 
BATAI JR: I want to concentrate on my music. That's what I care about. 
PICARD: Last year, all you cared about was mathematics. The year before
that, botany. Now 
BATAI JR: Through it all, there was my music. I think you know that,
Father. This is the life I want. 
PICARD: Well, we'll discuss it. 
BATAI JR: Thank you, father. 
(Batai goes back indoors) 
ELINE: Even after all these years you still have the ability to
surprise me. 
PICARD: If music is what he wants, why should I stand in his way?
Anyway, who knows how much time he'll have to follow any dream. 
ELINE: Are you still planning to talk to the Administrator tomorrow? 
PICARD: There's a possibility he'll dismiss me from the Council. 
ELINE: Unless, of course, you keep quiet. 
PICARD: No. The evidence is too pronounced. I can't stay silent. 
ELINE: What a surprise.

[Town square]

ADMINISTRATOR: Kamin, what do you hope to
accomplish? Spreading rumours that the planet is doomed. There could be
chaos. 
PICARD: The facts are here. At least show them to someone who will
recognise what they mean. 
ADMINISTRATOR: I won't be a party to your making trouble. 
PICARD: If you won't take them, I most certainly will. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Your observations, your findings, our scientists reached
those same conclusions two years ago. Well, what did you expect us to
do? Make it public? Can you imagine the effect? 
PICARD: But surely the technology must exist to save something of this
world? Perhaps some people could be evacuated. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Evacuated where? Our technology is limited. We're just
beginning to launch small missiles. 
PICARD: A collection of genetic samples, then. Something, anything. You
simply cannot let this civilisation die. 
ADMINISTRATOR: Enough! There is a plan in work. I cannot tell you more
than that. 
BATAI JR: Father! 
PICARD: What is it? 
BATAI JR: It's Mother. Hurry.
