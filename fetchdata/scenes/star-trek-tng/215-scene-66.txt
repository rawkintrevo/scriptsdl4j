TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER RO DATA

[Ten Forward]

(Ro presses the button just as Data walks out of
the circle. Troi and Miles writhe
in agony in the turquoise light, and two balls of energy leave them)

[Jefferies tube]

RO: Damn!

[Ten Forward]

DATA: (grabbing Picard by the throat) Tell them to
stop, or I kill everyone in this room, starting with you. 
PICARD: Picard to Bridge, abort immediately.

[Bridge]

RIKER: As you say, Captain. Riker to La Forge,
return to the Bridge.

[Jefferies tube]

[Ten Forward]

(The two balls of energy return to Troi and Miles) 
TROI: Are you ready to cooperate? 
PICARD: Yes. 
(Data lets him go) 
First officer's log, supplemental. The Enterprise
has moved into a synchronous orbit near the southern polar region. We
await further instructions from Ten Forward.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Any sign of the Essex? 
LAFORGE: Negative, Commander. Electromagnetic disturbances are even
worse here. Scanners can't read a thing. 
RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward.

[Ten Forward]

RIKER: Intense storm activity over the southern
pole is making it virtually impossible for us to pick up any trace of
the Essex. 
TROI: We are giving you the exact coordinates of our remains on board
the wreck of the Essex. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE: I'm receiving the coordinates now. 
RIKER: Can you tell what's there? 
LAFORGE: Just your basic ionic cyclone. I can't read a thing. 
RIKER: I'm sure as hell not going to beam up whatever might be down
there. 
LAFORGE: I've got a good excuse for you. The transporters aren't going
to work any better than the scanners. 
RIKER: Bridge to Ten Forward.
