TROI [OC]: I'm here. Can you hear me? Tell me about
the voices you hear. 
HAGAN [OC]: Bright. Bright out there. 
TROI [OC]: I don't understand. Bright what? Tell me more.

(Miles is pacing when Keiko enters) 
KEIKO: Boy, what a day this was. I'm doing an isozyme study on some
populations of Cardilia but they're turning out to have these really
weird polymorphisms. What a headache! 
O'BRIEN: Is that why you're late? 
KEIKO: Oh, no, I had a conference with Doctor Balthus. She wants to do
a study on the laticifer ontogeny of the Kaladian Thorn Flower, but I
don't have time to oversee another project. 
O'BRIEN: Was Tom Corbin there? 
KEIKO: What? 
O'BRIEN: Tom Corbin from the science lab. Remember him? 
KEIKO: Of course I remember him, but 
O'BRIEN: You use any excuse you can to pay him a visit. 
KEIKO: Miles, what are you saying? 
O'BRIEN: I think you know exactly what I'm saying. 
KEIKO: If I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous. 
O'BRIEN: Do you take me for a fool?

[Ten Forward]

GILLESPIE: Hello, Chief. Having coffee? 
O'BRIEN: No, I'm drinking too much coffee. 
GILLESPIE: I'm surprised to see you here at this hour. 
O'BRIEN: Why's that? 
GILLESPIE: You're not out of the honeymoon yet. Usually newlyweds can't
keep their hands off each other. 
O'BRIEN: She has work to do. She heads up the plant biology lab, you
know. 
GILLESPIE: Any strange things going on down there? 
O'BRIEN: Like what? 
GILLESPIE: I've been hearing things. Kenicki in Engineering told me he
saw a man in an old Starfleet uniform riding the lift near the engine
core. When the lift got to the top, there was no one on it. 
O'BRIEN: Ghost stories. 
GILLESPIE: There's more, there's lots more. There are strange things
happening on this ship, O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN: I'm surprised at you, Gillespie. A Starfleet officer. I have
more things to worry about than shades and spirits.
