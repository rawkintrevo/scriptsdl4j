LAFORGE: Message coming in from Haven, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(An elegant woman appears) 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven.
Captain Picard? 
PICARD: Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Your presence honours us, and your timing is
fortuitous, Captain. 
PICARD: In what way? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate,
violating our law. It has refused any attempt at communication. 
PICARD: Are you saying you believe it to be hostile? 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Failure to communicate is inherently hostile.
We have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty with the
Federation specifies your obligations in that matter. 
PICARD: Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defence matter. 
GUEST3 [on viewscreen]: Of course, Captain, but I'm very happy we have
you here.

GUEST5: Come in. 
TROI: I wanted to apologise for my mother's behaviour. 
GUEST5: Your mother's honest. I respect that. 
TROI: Yes, but she never lets up. 
GUEST5: I'll admit, her honesty is a bit persistent. 
TROI: I never heard it described better. But it is a Betazoid trait.
I'll try to be only half as annoying. 
GUEST5: Let's see, what can I tell you about myself? I'm a medical
doctor, for whatever that's worth. 
TROI: Doctor? 
GUEST5: If you're picking up my thoughts, you'd know. You can do that,
can't you? 
TROI: Sometimes. This must be what Mother felt about you. I believe we
could read each other eventually. 
GUEST5: Can I take that as a compliment? 
TROI: Absolutely. I only ever felt this, well, with someone who's on
this ship. 
GUEST5: Oh? Do I have competition? 
TROI: No. What he wants most is to captain a starship. 
GUEST5: What I want is to cure people. 
TROI: Well, I'm a practicing psychologist. Maybe we can work in
concert. We are going to be together a long time. 
GUEST5: Yes. That is the point of marriage, I suppose. 
TROI: I really thought you'd tell me you were an artist. I just felt
your mind very much on these. They are your work, aren't they? 
GUEST5: I can see it'll be very hard to keep secrets from you. 
TROI: This is why you were surprised when you first saw me. This woman.
You thought that I would be this woman. 
GUEST5: I have seen this face ever since I was a boy. When I closed my
eyes at night, I could hear her whispering my name. And knowing you
were Betazoid, I just assumed it was you projecting yourself into my
mind. 
TROI: I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped for. 
GUEST5: No. Please don't mistake a childish fantasy for disappointment.
You are so beautiful. I feel honoured. 
TROI: You've no idea who she is? 
GUEST5: It doesn't really matter now.

Captain's personal log. I trust my concern over the
problems of ship's Counsellor Troi are not based merely on losing a
highly valuable crew member. But it seems to me that she is trapped by
a custom of her home world which the facts of the twenty-fourth century
life have made unwise and unworkable. I wish
I could intervene.
