DATA: We will be entering the Turkana system in
eleven minutes, Captain. 
PICARD: Engine status. 
DATA: Stable. But we have maintained warp factor nine for longer than
is recommended, sir. 
WORF: Subspace message from the Arcos. Their transmitter is failing,
sir. Audio only. 
PICARD: Let's hear it. 
TAN TSU [OC]: Enterprise, this is Tan Tsu, Arcos engineer. Estimate
five minutes till warp drive containment breach.
Make that three minutes. Thanks for trying, Enterprise. 
PICARD: Ensign, warp nine point three. How much time? 
DATA: Seven minutes and fifteen seconds will bring us within
transporter range, Captain. 
PICARD: Nine point six. 
[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]:: Mister O'Brien, prepare to lock onto
the two crewmen. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, Captain. 
[Bridge]

DATA: We are now entering the Turkana system, sir. 
PICARD: Slow to impulse. 
DATA: Visual contact. 
RIKER: Get them out of there, O'Brien. 
(There's a bright flash on the viewscreen) 
RIKER: Status, O'Brien? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: There's nothing to lock onto, Commander. 
DATA: I am reading an ion trail characteristic of a freighter escape
pod. 
WORF: Unable to establish contact. 
PICARD: It could have been damaged by the explosion. They may have been
able to maintain orbit. 
RIKER: Let's hope they stay clear of the colony. 
DATA: That is exactly where the ion trail is leading, Commander. 
PICARD: Hail the colony. 
WORF: I've been trying to, Captain. No response. 
RIKER: They haven't been able to maintain reliable communications since
their government fell apart. 
DATA: The last Federation vessel to make contact was the Potemkin, six
years ago. They were warned that anyone transporting down to the colony
would be killed. 
PICARD: Number One, ready an away team.

Captain's log, supplemental. We are in orbit above
Turkana Four, an Earth colony that severed relations with the
Federation nearly fifteen years ago. I am concerned about sending an
away team, but if we are to discover the fate of the two missing
Federation crewmen, I see no alternative.
