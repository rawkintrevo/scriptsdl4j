[Soong's lab]

LORE: You did what you had to do? What kind of
answer is that? 
GUEST1: The only one I can give you. You were not functioning properly. 
DATA: Lore told me the colonists envied him because you made him so
completely human. 
GUEST1: I wouldn't exactly have used the word envious, Data. 
LORE: You disassembled me. You took me apart. 
DATA: Lore also told me the colonists petitioned you to replace him
with a less perfect android. 
GUEST1: The last thing you should think of yourself as, Data, is less
perfect. The two of you are virtually identical, except for a bit of
programming. 
DATA: It was a lie. Another lie. 
LORE: I would have proven myself worth to you, if you'd just given me a
chance. But it was easier just to turn your back and build your
precious Data. 
GUEST1: You were the first. You meant as much to me as Data ever did,
but you were unstable. The colonists were not envious of you, they were
afraid of you. You were unstable. 
DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. 
LORE: Why didn't you just fix me? It was within your power to fix me. 
GUEST1: It wasn't as easy as that. The next, the next logical step was
to construct Data. Afterward, I planned to get back to you, to fix you.

LORE: Next logical step. 
DATA: I am not less perfect than Lore. 
LORE: I am not less perfect than Lore. 
GUEST1: Enough! Both of you, sit down. Sit down. For all these years
I've been plagued by what went wrong. With all of your complexities,
Lore, your nuances, basic emotions seemed almost simple by comparison.
But the emotion turned, and twisted, became entangled with ambition.
Lore, if I had known you were no longer sitting in pieces on some
distant shelf, if I had known that I could simply press a button and
bring you here, I would have spent those years trying to make things
right for you as well. But all I knew of was Data. So I worked long and
hard, and now I believe I've succeeded. This is why I brought you here,
Data. Basic emotions. Simple feelings, Data. Your feelings. I've
imagined how hard it's been for you, living amongst beings so moved by
emotion. 
(Both androids stare at the tiny chip held in the tweezers) 
LORE: I don't have to imagine. I know how hard it's been. You'd be
surprised, Data. Feelings do funny things. You may even learn to
understand your evil brother. To forgive him. We will be more alike,
Data, you and I. You'll see. I'm happy for you. 
DATA: I question your sincerity, Lore. 
GUEST1: Perhaps with this you'll learn to be more trusting, Data. Your
brother has had good reason to be bitter. 
DATA: But sir, Lore was responsible for 
GUEST1: He wasn't given the chance that you and I were given, to live.
But now I'm sure he understands why I had to do what I had to do. 
If there were only time, Lore. What a shame. The procedure is quite
simple. I'm tired. I need to rest, first, I'm tired. 
(And he leaves the brothers eyeing each other)
