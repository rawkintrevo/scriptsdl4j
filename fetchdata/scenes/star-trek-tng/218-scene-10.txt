PICARD: My Aunt Adele cured a lot of sleepless
nights with this steamed milk. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. Mmm, nutmeg. 
PICARD: Whenever I get insomnia, I try to perfect the recipe. 
CRUSHER: It was the eeriest feeling. When the glass broke, it triggered
the sensation even more intensely that I'd done it all before. 
PICARD: You know, earlier, I was reading this book, and I had the
distinct feeling I'd read certain paragraphs before. But I assumed I'd
read the book years ago and I'd forgotten. 
CRUSHER: I've had this feeling for hours. And then the voices. 
PICARD: Well, it could be nothing more than the result of a sleepless
night. But let's be sure. Have Data and Geordi run a shipwide
diagnostic, concentrating on the time and place you heard the voices,
and we'll discuss the results tomorrow at seven hundred hours. 
CRUSHER: Thank you. For everything. 
PICARD: Thank Aunt Adele.

[Observation lounge]

DATA: The internal scans were negative. There was
no evidence of auditory anomalies anywhere on the ship. 
LAFORGE: As far as the sensors are concerned, nothing unusual happened
last night. 
CRUSHER: Ten other people reported hearing voices at the same time I
did. 
WORF [OC]: Bridge to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: We are getting unusual readings twenty thousand kilometres
off the starboard bow. 
PICARD: On our way.
