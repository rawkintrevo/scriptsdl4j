(science station LCARS 40274)
DATA: During microscopic examination of the torn uniform, I discovered
these alien skin cells. 
SUSANNA: Source? 
DATA: Undetermined. 
LAFORGE: Without something else to cross-reference, it would take us
weeks to try and identify them. 
DATA: Fortunately, we have more evidence. We were able to determine
that these footprints found near the shuttle were not made by any known
Tarchannen life form. 
SUSANNA: If we're pursuing a theory that somehow unknown aliens are
involved, I think I should tell you that we didn't find tracks like
that during the original investigation. 
DATA: The planet is subject to frequent sandstorms. Footprints might
have been obliterated prior to your arrival. Doctor Crusher and I will
begin to search the medical database in an attempt to match these with
some known life form.

SUSANNA: Aliens or no aliens, why would our people
start returning after five years, to be abducted? 
LAFORGE: Some sort of compulsion like a post-hypnotic command? 
SUSANNA: Something that happened while we were down there the first
time? 
LAFORGE: We can go back to the mission record, construct a log of
everyone's movements. 
SUSANNA: Look for some commonality, something we all touched. Maybe a
plant, or the sand. 
LAFORGE: Or even something we ingested. It could even be in the air
itself.
