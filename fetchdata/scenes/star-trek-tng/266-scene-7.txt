[Graveyard]

(Beverly is in local garb, and Ned is tidying the
edges of the grave) 
QUINT: You probably want to be alone. I'll leave. 
CRUSHER: No, Ned, it's okay. Look, I'm sorry we got off to a bad start
yesterday. I've been reading my grandmother's journals and I know how
much you meant to her. 
QUINT: Aye, she was a grand lady. You'll not see many more like her.
You have your grandmother's fire, that's for sure. 
CRUSHER: Ned, you're welcome to stay at the house after I've gone. I
need someone to take care of the place.

CRUSHER: Why not? 
QUINT: It'll bring the ghost. It's his home. Oh, he's out now,

he's bringing the storms.

Enterprise is trying to repair it. 
QUINT: Oh, sure. But who do you think is causing the malfunction? 
CRUSHER: I think your imagination is 
QUINT: Think what you want. See what you want. Just do as I say. Dinna

(Ned leaves. Lightning flashes and the grave is now covered in
camellias. Beverly flees)
