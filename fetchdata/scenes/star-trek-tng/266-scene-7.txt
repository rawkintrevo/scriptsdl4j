[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, I am detecting atmospheric
turbulence over the colony and large pockets of electrical activity. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: It is growing in intensity, sir. 
RIKER: That's one hell of a thunderstorm. 
PICARD: Bridge to Engineering. Mister Data, we're reading 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: An extremely large storm system over
the Caldos colony. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I thought that the weather control
malfunction was not severe.

[Engineering]

DATA: It began as a minor power fluctuation, sir,
but the effect has spread throughout the control grid. It has caused an
unusual concentration of cumulonimbus activity above the colony. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I suggest we set up a power transfer between the
Enterprise and the weather substations. Try to give them enough power
to stabilise the storm. 
PICARD [OC]: Make it so. 
[Howard home]

(Beverly enters, soaked from the storm. The house
is filled with camellias) 
CRUSHER: Who's there? Ned? Is that you? Hello? I know somebody's here,
so I suggest you 
(a mirror bounced against the wall. She removes it and is about to put
it back when she sees the reflection of a man behind her. She drops the
mirror, but there is no one there) 
CRUSHER: All right now, that's it. If you don't show yourself right now
I am calling the Enterprise and there will be ten security guards here
within thirty seconds. 
GUEST3 [OC]: Beverly. Beverly, I've come back for you 
CRUSHER: Who are you? 
GUEST3 [OC]: Don't you remember? I came to you last night while you were
asleep. 
CRUSHER: No, that was a dream. I'm calling the Enterprise. 
(she goes weak at the knees) 
GUEST3 [OC]: Now do you remember me? 
CRUSHER: Yes. What's, what's happening to me? Right now I feel so
strange. 
GUEST3 [OC]: I love you, Beverly, just as I loved Felisa before you. 
CRUSHER: Are you Ronin? 
GUEST3 [OC]: Yes. You saw me at the funeral. 
(Beverly has a little orgasm) 
CRUSHER: Who are you? 
GUEST3 [OC]: I'm a spirit. 
CRUSHER: I don't believe in 
GUEST3 [OC]: Ghosts? Nor did I in the beginning. I was born in sixteen
forty seven, in Glasgow on Earth. 
CRUSHER: You're telling me that you're an eight hundred year old ghost?

GUEST3 [OC]: I found a home with Jessel Howard. She was a pretty lass
with a mane of red hair, and eyes like diamonds. I loved her very much.
When she died, I stayed with her daughter, and her daughter, and on
down through the years, generation after generation. 
CRUSHER: And now you're here on Caldos, two hundred light years away? 
GUEST3 [OC]: When your family moved out into the galaxy, I moved with
them. 
CRUSHER: I don't believe you. 
GUEST3 [OC]: I believe you are the most beautiful women I have ever
known. 
CRUSHER: What's, what's happening to me? 
GUEST3 [OC]: We're becoming one, Beverly. We're going to be together. 
CRUSHER: I don't understand. Stop it!
