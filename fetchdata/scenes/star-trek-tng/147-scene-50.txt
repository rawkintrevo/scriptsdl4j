DATA:
Premise. The Ferengi wish to
capture the Hathaway believing it
to be value. Therefore we
must remove the ship from
their field of interest.
KOLRAMI: And they will soon relocate it after a two second warp. 
PICARD: There is a way. Number One, can you hear this? 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. We're all here.
