[Transporter room]

(O'Brien beams in two men, a tall Vulcan and a
stockier human) 
MENDROSSEN: Ah Captain Picard. I am Ki Mendrossen, the ambassador's
chief of staff. This is Sakkath, his personal assistant. 
PICARD: Has the ambassador been delayed? 
MENDROSSEN: He will be joining us momentarily. But first we must
discuss some matters of the utmost delicacy. 
PICARD: Please go ahead. 
MENDROSSEN: To be frank, Captain, the ambassador is not a young man. He
tires easily. 
SAKKATH: He's going to need a lot of rest to prepare himself for the
difficult job that awaits him. 
MENDROSSEN: Which is why it is imperative that he be allowed to
conserve his strength. I must request that you dispense with any formal
activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank. 
RIKER: We had planned a ship's concert this evening. 
PICARD: I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart. 
MENDROSSEN: I'm afraid it would be impossible for him to attend. Upon
his arrival he will be taken directly to his quarters where he will
remain in seclusion until we reach Legara Four. 
PICARD: You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbed
during the voyage. 
MENDROSSEN: That's all we ask. Well, now that's settled, the Ambassador
is waiting. 
(Sarek and Perrin are beamed aboard) 
PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek. 
SAREK: We come to serve. 
PICARD: Your service honours us. 
SAREK: Allow me to present she who is my wife. 
PICARD: Mrs. Sarek. 
PERRIN: Please call me Perrin, Captain. 
PICARD: This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. 
PERRIN: Captain, would you be so kind as to show us to our quarters? 
SAREK: I prefer to view the conference room first. 
MENDROSSEN: Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and I can handle all the
necessary details. 
SAREK: I will examine it for myself. 
PERRIN: Perhaps it would be best if we settled in first. 
SAREK: They worry about my health, Captain. Too much. You will take me
to the conference room, please. 
RIKER: If you'll follow me, sir.

[Conference room]

(There's a huge swimming pool filled with pink
frothy gunk in the room) 
WESLEY: Are the Legarans really going to sit in this stuff? 
LAFORGE: Well, I'm sure not. 
WESLEY: Can you believe this smell? 
LAFORGE: What smell? What can I say? To us it's a slime pit, but to
them it's home. 
WESLEY: Okay, the environmental controls are ready. What's next? 
LAFORGE: What, are you in some kind of hurry or something? 
WESLEY: Yeah, I have a date. 
LAFORGE: A date? With who? 
WESLEY: Ensign Dumont. 
LAFORGE: Really? She's very attractive. I've got to admit, Wes, I'm a
bit surprised. 
WESLEY: What, that she'd go out with me? 
LAFORGE: No, that you'd actually have the nerve to ask her. Way to go. 
(Sarek, Picard et al enter) 
SAREK: The room is not ready. 
PICARD: No Ambassador. Commander La Forge and Ensign Crusher are 
SAREK: The Legarans are very sensitive in matters of protocol. You will
remove all the furniture from the room. The walls must be bare. 
MENDROSSEN: I'm sure everything will be set up according to our
specifications before the Legarans arrive. Isn't that right, Captain? 
PICARD: I assure you, Ambassador, everything will be ready before the
conference begins. 
PERRIN: My husband and I have every confidence in you, Captain. 
SAREK: I have worked for ninety three years in preparation for this
meeting. It is vital that no detail be overlooked. 
SAKKATH: Perhaps we should allow these gentlemen to return to their
work, Ambassador. 
SAREK: That will be acceptable. These walls are too bright.
