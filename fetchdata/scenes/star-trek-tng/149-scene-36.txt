[Ready room]

TROI: In our dealings with other non-humanoid races
there has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. 
PICARD: But we must have something in common. We communicate. 
TROI: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, but
theirs continues to elude us. 
PICARD: Telepaths? 
TROI: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien race
communicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on a
planet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine.
(she hold up his cup of tea) S'smarith. What did I just say? 
PICARD: Cup? Glass? 
TROI: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. We
conceptualise the universe in relatively the same way. 
PICARD: Point taken. 
TROI: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is five
hundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They
consider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexity
to avoid any future misunderstandings. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonists
on visual. 
PICARD: On my way. So, it begins.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Your purpose, Enterprise? 
PICARD: We desire face-to-face negotiation to settle the crisis on Tau
Cygna Five. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Meaningless. 
PICARD: We are entitled to consultation under paragraph six hundred and
fifty three subparagraph nine. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Granted. 
(Transmission ends) 
RIKER: Was that an invitation? 
PICARD: I am taking it as such. Counsellor. You have the Bridge, Number
One. 
RIKER: Helm, maintain relative position. Mister Worf, tell transporter
room two to stand by. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Ard'rian's home]

KENTOR: And once the Federation resettles us, we'll
be left alone? 
DATA: If you so desire. 
HARITATH: We do. We like to do things on our own. 
DATA: The Federation will offer as little or as much help as you
dictate. 
ARD'RIAN: Kentor, are you with us? 
KENTOR: Yes. The question is, how do we convince Gosheven? 
HARITATH: Why do we need to? 
KENTOR: Because he's respected. Most people will do what he says. 
ARD'RIAN: They respect you, too. If you take a stand, they'll fall in
line. 
KENTOR: I don't know. Gosheven's got a lot of supporters. 
GOSHEVEN: Don't forget that, Kentor. I'm disappointed. I thought we'd
settled this. 
DATA: Apparently, that is not correct. 
GOSHEVEN: Still stirring up trouble? 
ARD'RIAN: Since when is talk trouble? 
GOSHEVEN: It's over. Don't you get it? You had your say. You lost. 
DATA: I appear to be reversing that defeat. 
GOSHEVEN: No, you're not. You're just stubborn. Well, let me tell you
something. 
(Gosheven uses an electric prod on Data. He falls over) 
GOSHEVEN: So am I. 
ARD'RIAN: Damn you, Gosheven. 
HARITATH: You killed him? 
GOSHEVEN: I've killed no one. I merely shut down a machine. That's it,
everyone. It's time to go home. You'll see that I'm right.

[Sheliak ship]

(Picard and Troi beam aboard. It's mostly dark,
just a few lights here and there) 
SHELIAK: Advance and speak. 
PICARD: Director, we will comply with your request to remove the colony
from Tau Cygna Five, but we need time. 
SHELIAK: The given time has elapsed. We carry the membership and we
will proceed with their debarkation. 
TROI: The temporary presence of these humans should not interfere with
your plans. 
SHELIAK: Unacceptable. You must remove the creatures. 
PICARD: I'm trying, but the needed ship will not be available for three
weeks. 
SHELIAK: Then you are in violation. 
PICARD: I have admitted that. I am only asking for a little
flexibility. 
SHELIAK: Section five hundred and one, paragraph seven hundred and
sixteen, subparagraph five. Unwanted lifeforms inhabiting H class
worlds may be removed at the discretion of the Sheliak Corporate. 
PICARD: We will remove them, but you must grant us the time we require.

SHELIAK: You need time, Picard of the Enterprise? We will save you
time. We will eradicate the human infestation. 
PICARD: They are not vermin. They are citizens of the Federation. I
will not permit this outrage! 
SHELIAK: Intelligent converse is impossible. You do not discuss, you
gibber. 
PICARD: Between intelligent species of good will 
[Bridge]

(Picard and Troi are zapped back onto the Bridge in
mid sentence) 
RIKER: I take it the Sheliak just hung up on us again.

[Ard'rian's home]

(Data suddenly sits up) 
ARD'RIAN: I was afraid your neural pathways were scrambled beyond
repair. 
DATA: I am equipped with diagnostic circuits and am able to correct
many malfunctions. 
ARD'RIAN: I'm not surprised at Gosheven's behaviour. But Kentor and the
others, they said they were with us. I guess words don't mean very
much. 
DATA: Perhaps that is a part of our difficulty. Words are all we have
been using. Humans seem to take much stronger notice of actions. I
require a phaser. 
ARD'RIAN: What's a phaser? 
DATA: A type of weapon. Unfortunately it does not function in the
presence of hyperonic radiation. I will have to be innovative.

[Shuttlecraft]

(Data removes a small circuit board from his right
forearm) 
DATA: Hyperonic radiation randomises phaser beams. But I believe I can
improvise a servocircuit which will compensate by continuously
recollimating the output. 
ARD'RIAN: You're using your own neural subprocessors to build a smarter
phaser. 
DATA: Essentially correct. Get word to Gosheven. Tell him I am coming
to the pumping station. Tell him I am going to destroy the aqueduct. 
ARD'RIAN: He'll try to stop you. 
DATA: I sincerely hope so.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go to yellow alert. Shields up. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Riker, put us nose to nose with the Sheliak ship. Any
move she makes, match it. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, hailing frequency. 
WORF: Open. They are not responding. 
PICARD: They don't have to answer. They just have to listen. Sheliak
vessel, you will have to get past me to get at the colony on Tau Cygna
Five. 
WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Close channel. And get me that treaty. They've been beating us
over the head with it for three days. Let's see if we can't find
something in it that we can turn to our own advantage.
