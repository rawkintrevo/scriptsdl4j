RIKER: Coils here. 
DATA: They are identical to the coil we found earlier, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: The Captain's log, perhaps? 
RIKER: That's what we were thinking. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, are they in working condition?

DATA [OC]: I believe so, sir.

LAFORGE: Computer, generate a cross section image
of the dilithium crystal chamber. What about re-orienting the crystal? 
LEAH [OC]: It is possible to reorient the crystal. The key lies in
adjusting the lattice structure direction. This modification will be
integrated into the next class starship. 
LAFORGE: Sorry, can't wait. You and me, Leah, we've got just two hours
to figure this thing out. You know what I need to do? I need to get
inside there. I need to be able to turn that thing inside out.
Computer, is there a cross section image we can replicate on a
holodeck? 
COMPUTER: Select menu. Design specifications or prototype schematic. 
LAFORGE: Prototype? Elaborate. 
COMPUTER: A development stage prototype schematic at Utopia Planitia.
Drafting room five of the Mars Station, Stardate 40174. 
LAFORGE: Perfect. Recreate it in holodeck three. Stay with me, Doc.
