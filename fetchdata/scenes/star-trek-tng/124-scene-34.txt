PICARD RIKER DATA LAFORGE GEORDI

[Vandor corridor]

DATA: Doctor Manheim forgot to mention one of his
security precautions, sir. I am proceeding into the laboratory. 
[Laboratory]

(The code works, but the fluorescent tubes only
open part way. Data enters cautiously. In the centre is a distortion)
PICARD [OC]: Mister Data, this channel will remain open. Please
continue to report. 
DATA: This appears to be the instrument Doctor Manheim described. It
should confirm when the next time effect will occur. 
RIKER [OC]: Data?

[Bridge]

RIKER: Did Manheim give you enough information to
decipher the security code? 
[Laboratory]

DATA: I will know in a moment, sir. According to
calculations, the next time effect will occur in one minute thirty
seconds. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: What's the next step, Mister Data? 
[Laboratory]

DATA: I will need to add a specific amount of
antimatter to rebalance and align the system. 
PICARD [OC]: Will that plug the hole? 
DATA: Theoretically, yes. In reality I do not know. 
(He opens a container and gets the antimatter, putting it on the end of
a long rod) 
DATA: When the effect hits, the forcefields will align, opening a clean
straight path to the other dimension. Whatever the time distortion, I
must add the antimatter at the appropriate moment. Geordi, if the
Professor was right, I will need a twenty seven second countdown. 
LAFORGE [OC]: You got it, Data. 
DATA: Captain, I now have the antimatter and am moving towards the
opening at the end of the lab. The next time distortion should occur
within seconds. Geordi, begin countdown on my mark. Now. 
(There's a big sparkle. Data looks back to see himself midway across
the lab - no 2 - and getting the antimatter - no 3. Meanwhile, Geordi's
voice is counting down, very echoy)
DATA 3: Captain, there appear to be three of us. 
DATA 1: Should I drop the antimatter or wait for one of you? 
DATA 3: Only one of us is at the correct time continuum. 
DATA 1: Which one? 
DATA 2: Me. It's me. 
GEORDI [OC]: Five, four, three, two, one. 
(The middle Data arrives at number 1 and the antimatter goes in, before
number 3 gets there. The effect stops. There is only one Data) 
PICARD [OC]: Data, report. Are you all right? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Is it closed? 
DATA: It is well patched, sir. Closed indicates a permanent condition,
which I cannot guarantee. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Patched is good enough. Well done. Beam
back immediately.
