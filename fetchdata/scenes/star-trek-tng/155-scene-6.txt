Captain's log, Stardate 43349.2. An unidentified
distress signal has led to the discovery of a crashed Romulan vessel on
the surface of Galorndon Core, a Federation planet. We have recovered
one survivor, but Lieutenant Commander La Forge did not report back
with the away team and is still missing.

[Transporter room]

CRUSHER: Get him to Sickbay. 
WORF: Secure Sickbay. Post a guard in visual contact at all times. 
CRUSHER: He's not going anywhere, Lieutenant. 
O'BRIEN: I'm sorry, Commander. There's just no way to lock in on
anything down there. 
RIKER: Keep trying, O'Brien. 
O'BRIEN: The electrical storm's creating thousands of ghosts. 
RIKER: Well beam some of those ghosts back. One of them may be Geordi.
Permission to lead another away team, sir. 
PICARD: Denied. When we get another window in the storms. The crash
site?
