RIKER OBRIEN LAFORGE WORF PICARD LEFLER DATHON

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Riker to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
RIKER [OC]: How close are we on that transporter? 
LAFORGE: Two hours, maybe three. 
RIKER [OC]: I want the Captain out of there now. 
LAFORGE: That's not very likely, sir. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I don't want to hear that, Commander. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lefler, what's the resonance frequency? 
LEFLER: Point three four over standard. 
LAFORGE: I want a resolution of point five three at the very least.
Commander, I'll need about two more minutes. 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: But there's a good chance this isn't
going to work. 
WORF: If it fails 
RIKER: I know. We will have tipped our hand to the Tamarians. But it's
a chance we have to take. 
WORF: Agreed. 
RIKER: La Forge. Proceed. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We're on it. La Forge out. 
RIKER: Riker to transporter room one.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: O'Brien here, Commander. 
RIKER [OC]: Stand by, Mister O'Brien.

[Planet surface]

(a big something appears and disappears near them) 
DATHON: Mirab, his sails unfurled? 
PICARD: Come on. 
DATHON: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
(then the creature is behind them, and vanishes again) 
DATHON: Shaka, when the walls fell. 
PICARD: Shaka. You said that before. When I couldn't build a fire. Is
that a failure? An inability to do something? 
DATHON: Darmok and Jalad 
PICARD: At Tanagra. I remember the words but I don't understand.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Matrix levels? 
LEFLER: Annular convergence four three nine point two oh five.
Confinement resolution point five two seven. 
LAFORGE: That isn't going do it. Increase thermal input coefficient to
one hundred fifty percent. 
LEFLER: Increasing now. 
RIKER [OC]: Status, La Forge. 
LAFORGE: We're almost there, Commander. Lefler, shunt the overload to
the phase transition sequencers in transporter one. 
LEFLER: Yes, sir. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to O'Brien.
