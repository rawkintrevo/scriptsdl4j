little unlimited devidia better foreknowledge let true sounded sent

[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: So, do you want to talk about it? 
DATA: Are you referring to the foreknowledge of my death? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
DATA: I have no particular desire to discuss the matter. Do you need to
talk about it? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
DATA: Why? 
LAFORGE: Data, this has got to bother you a little. 
DATA: On the contrary. I find it rather comforting. 
LAFORGE: Comforting? 
DATA: I have often wondered about my own mortality as I have seen
others around me age. Until now it has been theoretically possible that
I would live an unlimited period of time. And although some might find
this attractive, to me it only reinforces the fact that I am
artificial. 
LAFORGE: I never knew how tough this must be for you. 
DATA: Tough? As in difficult? 
LAFORGE: Knowing that you would outlive all your friends. 
DATA: I expected to make new friends. 
LAFORGE: True. 
DATA: And then to outlive them as well. 
LAFORGE: Now that you know that you might not? 
DATA: It provides a sense of completion to my future. In a way, I am
not that different from anyone else. I can now look forward to death. 
LAFORGE: I never thought of it that way. 
DATA: One might also conclude that it brings me one step closer to
being human. I am mortal. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Bridge officers. We're approaching the Devidia
system. Report to your stations. 
LAFORGE: I'll see you later. Let's get together for a game of chess or
something, okay? 
(Data leaves) 
GUINAN: That sounded like a very intense discussion. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. They found Data's head a mile beneath San Francisco.
Been down there about five centuries. 
GUINAN: That's why the Enterprise has been sent back to Earth. I didn't
realise. 
LAFORGE: It's something, isn't it? He seems fine about it. Better than
I am. Well, I'd better get to Engineering. 
(Geordi leaves) 
GUINAN: Full circle.
