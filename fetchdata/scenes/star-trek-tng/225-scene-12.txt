[Courtyard]

(a young girl is playing in the sunshine as Picard
plays his flute indoors) 
ELINE [OC]: Meribor.

[Living room]

(the little girl runs to Eline, who is holding a
baby) 
ELINE: Meribor, this is your brother's ceremony. Don't fidget now. 
PICARD: We name this child for a dear friend who died a year ago. But
now his memory will live on in his namesake. 
ELINE: We name you Batai, in his honour. 
PICARD: And he's starting out in the warmth of friends. Thank you.
Please, help yourselves to something to eat. 
MAN: Congratulations, Kamin. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
ELINE: It seems like only yesterday we had Meribor's naming ceremony.
Go on. 
PICARD: I remember. I was so nervous I was afraid that I would drop
her. Now look at the little lady. 
ELINE: She's no lady. Tromping through the hills with you all day,
digging up those soil samples you insist upon collecting. No, she's her
father's daughter. 
PICARD: I would have believed I didn't need children to complete my
life. Now I couldn't imagine life without them. 
ELINE: Kamin, what is it? 
(Picard collapses) 
ELINE: Get the doctor. Hurry!
