[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(K'Ehleyr's body is being removed) 
CRUSHER: Multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Too much trauma
to the internal organs. There wasn't time enough to take her into
stasis. 
PICARD: Where's Worf? 
CRUSHER: I don't know. He disappeared just after I arrived. 
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf is not aboard the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Where is he? 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf transported to the Klingon ship Vorn at
seventeen thirty hours. 
RIKER: On my way.

[Duras' quarters]

WORF: Duras. 
DURAS: What is that doing here? 
KLINGON: He has claimed the right of vengeance. 
DURAS: You have no rights here, traitor! 
WORF: K'Ehleyr was my mate. 
(Duras takes a sword)

[Corridor]

DATA: If Lieutenant Worf resists, sir? 
RIKER: He's coming back with us one way or another. Set phasers on
maximum stun.

[Duras' quarters]

(The fight is underway, and the two are evenly
matched) 
DURAS: I'm the only one, Worf, the only one who can prove your
innocence. Kill me and you're a traitor for ever. 
WORF: Then that is how it shall be. 
(Finally, Worf knocks Duras to the floor. The door opens to reveal
Riker and Data) 
RIKER: Worf! 
(Worf deals the killing blow anyway) 
(The Klingon ships depart)
