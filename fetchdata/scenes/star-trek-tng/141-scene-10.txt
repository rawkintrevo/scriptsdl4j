[Geophysics lab]

(Wesley marches in, no nonsense) 
WESLEY: Ensign Davies? I want that ico-spectrogram run on the Selcundi
Drema system. 
GUEST2: You got it.

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: It is no longer a matter of how wrong Data
was, or why he did it. The dilemma exists. We have to discuss the
options. And please talk freely. 
WORF: There are no options. The Prime Directive is not a matter of
degrees. It is an absolute. 
PULASKI: I have a problem with that kind of rigidity. It seems callous
and even a little cowardly. 
PICARD: Doctor, I'm sure that is not what the Lieutenant meant, but in
a situation like this, we have to be cautious. What we do today may
profoundly affect upon the future. If we could see every possible
outcome 
RIKER: We'd be gods, which we're not. If there is a cosmic plan, is it
not the height of hubris to think that we can, or should, interfere? 
LAFORGE: So what are you saying? That the Dremans are fated to die? 
RIKER: I think that's an option we should be considering. 
LAFORGE: Consider it considered, and rejected. 
TROI: If there is a cosmic plan, are we not a part of it? Our presence
at this place at this moment in time could be a part of that fate. 
LAFORGE: Right, and it could be part of that plan that we interfere. 
RIKER: Well that eliminates the possibility of fate. 
DATA: But Commander, the Dremans are not a subject for philosophical
debate. They are a people. 
PICARD: So we make an exception in the deaths of millions. 
PULASKI: Yes. 
PICARD: And is it the same situation if it's an epidemic, and not a
geological calamity? 
PULASKI: Absolutely. 
PICARD: How about a war? If generations of conflict is killing
millions, do we interfere? Ah, well, now we're all a little less secure
in our moral certitude. And what if it's not just killings. If an
oppressive government is enslaving millions? You see, the Prime
Directive has many different functions, not the least of which is to
protect us. To prevent us from allowing our emotions to overwhelm our
judgement. 
PULASKI: My emotions are involved. Data's friend is going to die. That
means something. 
WORF: To Data. 
PULASKI: Does that invalidate the emotion? 
LAFORGE: What if the Dremans asked for our help? 
DATA: Yes. Sarjenka's transmission could be viewed as a call for help. 
PICARD: Sophistry. 
PULASKI: I'll buy that excuse. We're all jigging madly on the head of a
pin anyway. 
WORF: She cannot ask for help from someone she does not know. 
DATA: She knows me. 
RIKER: What a perfectly vicious little circle. 
DATA: We are going to allow her to die, are we not? 
PICARD: Data, I want you to sever the contact with Drema Four. 
(Data goes to a wall panel and taps in commands) 
COMPUTER: Isolating frequency. 
GUEST1 [OC]: Data. Data, where are you? Why won't you answer? Are you
angry me? Please, please, I'm so afraid. Data, Data, where are you? 
PICARD: Wait. Oh, Data. Your whisper from the dark has now become a
plea. We cannot turn our backs.

Captain's log, stardate 42741.3. We are entering
into orbit of Drema Four, the planet from which Data received the
distress signal. Sensors indicate that the volcanic activity is
increasing.
