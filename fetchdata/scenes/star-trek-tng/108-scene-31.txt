[Observation lounge]

TROI: Which confirms the feeling of duality that I
sensed earlier in both of them. 
PICARD: Why didn't you report it? 
TROI: Because, sir, I assumed at first it was the kind of duality we
Betazeds feel in all of you. Even you, sir. When you approach a
decision and ask yourself which way to go, who are you talking to? 
PICARD: Your hypnotism revealed another form of duality? 
TROI: Yes, sir. I believe something invaded them. 
CRUSHER: It seems the only possible conclusion. 
PICARD: Data, let's proceed without the pipe. 
DATA: Yes, sir. If you wish, sir. But I ask if you'd take it as
incontrovertible that it cannot be a family member or one of our crew? 
PICARD: Yes. Very unlikely. 
DATA: Then our investigation was worthwhile, sir. We have eliminated
both the delegates and the ship's regular complement. 
PICARD: Data, what are you suggesting? 
DATA: I am referring to the great detective's credo, sir. I quote, we
must fall back on the old axiom that when other contingencies fail,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

WESLEY: That engine computer net wasn't repaired,
sir. It just suddenly became all right. 
LAFORGE: Sometimes it's the result that counts, you know. What the? Oh,
no. 
WORF: What is it? 
LAFORGE: Helm control just went down. She won't respond. 
WORF: Bridge to Captain. You're needed here immediately. 
LAFORGE: Wes, alert Engineering from your panel, alright? 
WESLEY: I'm trying. 
PICARD: Report. 
WORF: Helm is down, sir. There's no apparent reason. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we've just dropped to impulse power. 
(Picard leans over and touches the console. Blue energy enters him) 
LAFORGE: Sir, are you all right? I thought I just saw 
PICARD: I'm fine. Everything is fine now. Why the drop to impulse
power, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: The helm is suddenly malfunctioning, sir. 
PICARD: Malfunctioning? You're wrong. Look again. 
LAFORGE: Sir, I was just 
RIKER: Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Well, there's nothing wrong with it now, sir. Everything is
just as it should be. 
PICARD: In that case, make our heading nine two five mark three seven. 
LAFORGE: Sir? 
PICARD: You have a problem with that heading, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: You want to double back on our course, sir? 
PICARD: Isn't that what I ordered? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Sir, I'm puzzled about your reversing our course. 
PICARD: That energy cloud, Commander. I believe it important we have
another look at it. 
RIKER: But we're behind schedule for Parliament already. 
PICARD: I believe a very important scientific discovery awaits us on
this heading. 
TROI: Perhaps you'd like to share your reasoning on that, sir? 
DATA: Yes, since we obtained only minimal information on our sensor
pass of it. 
PICARD: Right, Data. We must go back to learn more. Counsellor, do you
believe a ship Captain should explain every order? 
TROI: Of course not, sir.

[Corridor]

ANTICAN: I demand to see the Captain. 
O'BRIEN: (as a security guard) Stop! Return to your quarters. 
SELAY: What is that doing on our deck? 
ANTICAN: I demand to know why this starship has changed its course! 
O'BRIEN: Please, return to your quarters, delegates!

(A model of NCC1701 shuttlecraft is in the corner) 
DATA: A mere change of direction hardly justifies mutiny. 
CRUSHER: Exactly what do you believe you're sensing from him? 
TROI: It's just a feeling that he's, well, that he's closed part of his
mind to me. I just feel that the Captain has become, perhaps dangerous.

RIKER: If he's dangerous. If. 
LAFORGE: Then he'd have to be relieved of command. Which you could do,
Doctor, but it's beaucoup trouble if you're wrong. 
DATA: And at the moment it is all pure speculation. He has done nothing
to subject the Enterprise to danger. 
CRUSHER: I'd need a medical log citing clear evidence of incapacity.
You could do it without that problem. 
RIKER: Only if all command officers agreed it vital to do so. But he
has not been showing any overt unusual behaviour. 
TROI: Ultimately, I believe he will. 
CRUSHER: As second in command, it's still in your corner. I'll order
medical and psychiatric exams. You'll have to back me up somehow.

First Officer's log, supplemental. After meeting
with the senior officers, Doctor Crusher and I decided to approach the
Captain regarding his recent behaviour.
