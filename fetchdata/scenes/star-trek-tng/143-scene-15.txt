RIKER: Are you all right? 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Sure. Why do you ask? 
RIKER: Counsellor Troi has expressed misgivings about your absence from
the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: I don't think there's anything to worry about.

RIKER: Understood. As soon as you complete the repairs, I want you back
here. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: Yes, sir, I should be done here momentarily.

[Pakled ship]

LAFORGE: You see? Like that. (Geordi puts the
circuit boards back) There. Your guidance is now up and running. 
(Then the lights go out) 
LAFORGE: Main power failure? 
GREBNEDLOG: Will our ship go now? 
LAFORGE: Your guidance is operational, but you're not going anywhere,
not with a main power failure. 
GREBNEDLOG: It is broken. 
REGINOD: Can you make it go? 
LAFORGE: Commander Riker? 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: I have a problem. 
RIKER: On screen. 
LAFORGE [on viewscreen]: It looks like this is going to take a little
bit longer than I anticipated.

[Shuttlecraft]

WESLEY: I guess you would have preferred Commander
Riker as a travelling companion. 
PICARD: What? 
WESLEY: It's okay. You're not too comfortable with me. I understand. 
PICARD: Ensign. Wesley, that's not true. You're a fine young man. 
WESLEY: You don't have to say that, sir. It's pretty obvious how you
feel. 
PICARD: Is it? How so? 
WESLEY: Everyone knows. You don't like kids. That's too bad. You'd have
made a good father. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
(Picard takes his book to a rear seat) 
WESLEY: Didn't you ever wish you had kids of your own? 
PICARD: Wishing for a thing does not make it so.
