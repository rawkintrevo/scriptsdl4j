[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

PICARD: What's going on? 
CRUSHER: We're under attack. 
CHILTON: Shield strength down to fifty two percent. Minor damage to the
port nacelle. 
WORF: Two Klingon attack cruisers decloaking to port and starboard. 
CRUSHER: Warp speed. Get us out of here. 
CHILTON: Warp power's offline, sir. 
CRUSHER: Heading one four eight, mark two one five. Full impulse. 
CHILTON: Impulse power's fluctuating. Shields down to thirty percent. 
PICARD: Weapons status? 
WORF: These weapons are no match for their shields. 
CRUSHER: Geordi, we need more warp power, now. 
LAFORGE: I'm trying, Captain. They're too much for us. I can't keep the
phase inducers online. 
CHILTON: Shields down to nine percent. One more hit and they'll
collapse. 
CRUSHER: Open a channel. 
CHILTON: Open. 
CRUSHER: This is Captain Beverly Picard. We are a medical ship on a
mission of mercy. Please break off all (Bang) Worf, signal our
surrender. 
WORF: Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh! 
(but they fire again, and Chilton is killed) 
WORF: Our shields have collapsed. We are defenceless. 
DATA: Captain, another ship decloaking bearing two one five mark three
one oh. It's the Enterprise. 
(a three-nacelled Enterprise) 
DATA: They're hailing us. 
CRUSHER: On screen. 
RIKER: I had a feeling you weren't going to listen to me. Stand by.
I'll see if I can get the Klingons' attention. 
(Enterprise phasers slice through the Klingon shields and ships.
KaBOOM!) 
WORF: The Enterprise is drawing their fire. 
CRUSHER: Damage report. 
LAFORGE: The warp core has been badly damaged. There's a breach in
progress. 
PICARD: We have to stop it! 
DATA: The Klingon ship is disengaging. Admiral Riker is hailing us. 
RIKER: Our sensors indicate your ship has a warp core breach in
progress. Prepare for emergency beam out.

[Future Bridge]

(everyone is beamed onto the bridge)
GAINES: All the Pasteur's crew are safely on board, Admiral. 
RIKER: Raise the shields. Where are the Klingons? 
GAINES: They're still moving off, sir. Half a light year away. 
RIKER: They'll be back. As I said, I figured you wouldn't take no for
answer. (to Worf) But I thought you had more sense than to send a
defenceless ship across the border into hostile territory with no
escort. 
WORF: If you had not turned down the Captain when he came to you for
help, none of this would have happened. Unlike you, I still have a
sense of honour and loyalty. 
PICARD: We don't have time for this. The Pasteur's core is going to
breach. 
RIKER: Take us out of here. Full impulse. 
(KaBOOM) 
RIKER: All right, let's get out of here. 
PICARD: No, Will, we can't! We have to save humanity. 
RIKER: Engage cloak. 
GAINES: Admiral, we took a direct hit to the starboard plasma coil. Our
cloak isn't functioning. Engineering reports it'll be seven hours
before we can cloak again. 
RIKER: All right, we'll do it the old-fashioned way. Set a course for
the Federation, warp thirteen. 
PICARD: Will, don't leave! We have to stay here and find what is
causing the temporal anomaly. 
RIKER: We can't stay, Captain. 
PICARD: We have to! Everything depends on it! We can't leave now!
Please, listen to me! 
(Beverly knocks him out with a hypo)

a crewman in the present)
