[Transporter room]

(Alexander's toy has been equipped with a comm.
badge. When it bumps into the Ferengi this time, he and his weapon are
beamed away to another transporter pad with a working forcefield)

[Engineering]

RO JR: Tag! 
GUINAN JR: You're it! 
(they put comm. badges on the backs of the Ferengis and they go to join
their colleague)

[Corridor]

BERIK: Yes? 
ALEXANDER: I found this in the school room. Is it yours? 
(the comm. badge is activated as he hands it over. Bye, bye, Berik.)

[Corridor]

(Keiko hypos a Ferengi into unconsciousness) 
[Corridor]

(Picard leaves the schoolroom) 
PICARD JR: That's all of them except for the two on the Bridge. Wait
here until I return. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir.

[Bridge]

RIKER: So, one more time. The ramistat kiloquad
capacity is a function of the square root of the intermix ratio times
the sum of the plasma injector quotient. 
(Picard enters, distracting Morta. Riker knocks him out) 
[Ready room]

LURIN: Come in. 
(Picard enters with a phaser) 
PICARD JR: I believe you're in my chair.

Captain's log, stardate: 46236.3. We have taken
Lurin and his men into custody. The Ferengi Alliance has quickly
disavowed any knowledge of these renegades. With the mining operation
closed and our crew back on board, we can now turn our attention to
other problems.

[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Phase inducers activated. Energy levels
nominal. 
CRUSHER: I'm loading the adult patterns into the buffer. 
O'BRIEN: Transposition matrix locked in. That should do it, Captain. 
PICARD JR: Energise. 
(the youth dematerialises, and the adult materialises. He checks his
hairline.) 
CRUSHER: How do you feel? 
PICARD: I feel fine. Everything seems a little smaller.
