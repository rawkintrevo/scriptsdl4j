RIKER: The Mintakans are beginning to believe in a
god 
[Sickbay]

RIKER [OC]: And the one they've chosen is you. 
BARRON: Picard, you must beam Palmer aboard immediately. Without
medical attention 
PICARD: It's not as simple as that. He is surrounded by Mintakans. If
he dematerialises before their eyes, the impact 
BARRON: It will slightly increase the cultural contamination which
already exists. A small price for saving Palmer's life. 
PICARD: Number One? 
[Assembly hall]

PICARD [OC]: Is there any chance of your freeing
Palmer and transporting up unseen? 
RIKER: We can try. 
PICARD [OC]: Try hard. 
[Sickbay]

PICARD: Picard out. 
BARRON: Picard, I must protest. You're endangering Palmer with this
delay. 
PICARD: I am aware of that. But each of us, including Doctor Palmer
took an oath that we would uphold the Prime Directive, if necessary,
with our lives.

[Assembly hall] 
(A woman is tending Palmer's head injury) 
HALI: Riga and I were hunting on the third ridge. We followed a
hornbuck into a cave. The stranger was there, asleep. 
NURIA: This Palmer is one of the Overseer's servants? 
LIKO: Yes. The Picard has many servants. Isn't that true, Fento? 
FENTO: According to legend. But if this Palmer is a servant of the
Overseer, what was he doing in the cave? 
OJI: Perhaps he ran away. 
HALI: Or he failed the Picard somehow and was hiding from him. 
LIKO: We should bind him in case he wakes and tries to escape. 
RIKER: It's senseless for this stranger to be held captive. All this
talk of the Overseer, it's old superstitions. 
NURIA: I disagree. All the evidence indicates that the Overseer exists.

LIKO: And I heard the Picard say he wanted to find Palmer. 
OJI: Then by keeping Palmer safe, we will please the Picard. 
LIKO: And he'll grant us favours in return. 
NURIA: Favours? 
FENTO: It is said that the Overseer is all powerful. He can provide
gentle winters, plentiful hunting, fertile crops, anything. 
LIKO: He could even bring back those who have died. 
NURIA: It's agreed. We will save Palmer for the Picard. 
TROI: I've seen another one, like Palmer. 
LIKO: Another servant of the Picard? 
TROI: He's headed toward the caves. 
NURIA: Fento, stay and bind Palmer. 
(The active villagers leave, following Troi)

MAN: Where? 
TROI: Over there.
