RIKER ODAN PICARD TROI NURSE OGAWA CRUSHER DATA LEKA

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He's in shock, he's lost a lot of blood,
but that still doesn't explain these readings. Eosinophilia in the
cerebrospinal fluid at forty six percent. 
OGAWA: Sedimentation rate is twenty nine, but his lymphocytes are still
intact. 
CRUSHER: It's as though there's a parasite at work. Odan, Odan. I need
to do exploratory surgery. You may have a parasitic infection. 
ODAN: You must not. 
CRUSHER: But you won't survive. 
(then she notices the movement in his abdomen) 
CRUSHER: What is that? 
ODAN: Beverly, that is me. 
CRUSHER: What? 
ODAN: This body is just a host. I am that parasite. That is what must
survive. It has always been this way. The Trill are a joined species. A
host and a symbiont, and in this fashion we have survived for
millennia. 
CRUSHER: You're dying. What can I do? 
ODAN: The host body is dying. You must contact the Trill quickly. Tell
them I need another host. They will send a replacement. I know this is
difficult to accept, but I beg you, Doctor Beverly, help me. This
mission must be completed.

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: Odan's host body died of the injuries just
over an hour ago. But the symbiont being, Odan, is still alive. Odan is
the one who negotiated the last treaty, but the man everyone thought
was his father was just another host body. 
RIKER: And the reason Odan refused the transporter? 
CRUSHER: It would have damaged the symbiont. 
PICARD: We've contacted the Trill. Another host will be here in forty
hours. 
CRUSHER: I've placed Odan in stasis. He can survive another hour, maybe
two, but not beyond that. 
DATA: Would it be possible for me to serve as a temporary carrier? 
CRUSHER: No, Data. The relationship requires a biological being. 
PICARD: We are at a desperate impasse in the Peliar system. The attack
on the shuttlecraft has inflamed the dispute. 
TROI: Who was responsible? 
PICARD: No one will admit anything. Each side accuses the other and the
threats are mounting. We need Odan. 
RIKER: Doctor, could a human host carry him? 
CRUSHER: I believe so. From Odan's description of the process it should
be possible. But I don't have 
RIKER: Then I volunteer. 
CRUSHER: There's been no precedent for a human host. I couldn't
guarantee what might happen. 
PICARD: The risk is too great, Commander. 
RIKER: Weigh it against the prospect of war. 
PICARD: It's your choice, Will. 
RIKER: Let's get to it.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I've given you a local anaesthetic. You
must be conscious during the implantation. Drugs might damage the
symbiont. 
RIKER: I understand. 
CRUSHER: Laser scalpel. 
(She cuts up from his navel, then gets the creature from it's jar and
places it on his belly. It finds its own way inside him) 
CRUSHER: How do you feel? Is there pain? 
RIKER: No, just some strange sensations. 
CRUSHER: Vital signs? 
OGAWA: Heart rate one hundred ten. Blood pressure ninety over forty. 
CRUSHER: I can't close yet, The assimilation's not complete. 
OGAWA: Pulse one thirty and climbing. EEG is erratic. 
CRUSHER: He's going to start fibrillating. Two hundred milligrams of
metrazene. 
NURSE: Yes, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Hang on, Will. 
NURSE: We've got incorporation, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: I'm closing. 
NURSE: Brain waves are still irregular. 
CRUSHER: The metrazene should have stabilised him. I'll give it ten
seconds more before we go in again. 
NURSE: Here we go. EEG approaching regular. 
OGAWA: Blood pressure levelling off. 
CRUSHER: That's better. Signs are returning to normal. Will, it's
Beverly. Can you hear me? 
RIKER: Hello. 
CRUSHER: You're going to be all right. How do you feel? 
RIKER: I'm fine. You look a little tired, Doctor Beverly.

[Bridge]

RIKER: I know this must be disturbing, Governor,
but you must convince the inhabitants of the moons that I am Odan. I
have his skills, his thoughts, his memories. 
LEKA [on viewscreen]: They will perceive you as a Starfleet officer,
perhaps with your own agenda. 
RIKER: The man they knew as my father, the man who stands before them,
both are merely hosts. It is your task to help them understand. 
LEKA [on viewscreen]: I will try. I cannot promise they will listen.
They are more factionalised than ever. Listening is a skill which seems
to have evaporated with the heat of argument. 
RIKER: Speak softly, Governor. Those who cannot hear an angry shout may
strain to hear a whisper. 
LEKA [on viewscreen]: I will do what I can. 
(transmission ends) 
PICARD: Well done. Mister Worf, will you escort the Ambassador to his
quarters. 
RIKER: I'm just a little dizzy. I'll be fine. I just need to lie
down.
PICARD: Picard to Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: Doctor, the Ambassador is not well. Will you please attend to
him in his quarters. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Right away, sir.

[Odan's quarters]

CRUSHER: White cell count is elevated, six tenths
of a degree of temperature. But no sign of rejection. 
RIKER: That's good. 
CRUSHER: You look awfully pale. 
RIKER: Just a little weak and light-headed. 
CRUSHER: Cerebral blood flow looks normal. I'll leave you a metabolic
booster. Use it if the symptoms get worse. 
RIKER: Beverly. 
CRUSHER: Beyond that, I don't know what to do. This is all new to me. 
RIKER: It is new to me as well. Please, don't go. We've got to talk
about this. 
CRUSHER: I don't know what to say. 
RIKER: Nor do I, but I know that this silence will injure us. 
CRUSHER: Well maybe you should have thought about that sooner. Maybe
you should have told me what you were. It didn't seem to bother you to
remain silent yesterday. 
RIKER: It never occurred to me. This is what I am. Did you ever tell me
that you are only a single being? Of course not. That was normal to
you. 
CRUSHER: I don't know who you are. 
RIKER: You must understand, whoever I seem to be, I am Odan, who loved
you. That has not changed. I still love you. I can't help that. If this
causes you pain, I will suppress it, I will keep my distance. Doctor
Beverly, I would never hurt you.
