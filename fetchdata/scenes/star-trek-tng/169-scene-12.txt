[Bridge]

TROI: I had a very strange visit from one of your
officers today. 
LAFORGE: Barclay? Yes, I can imagine. Were you able to do anything for
him? 
TROI: To be honest, I'm not sure what happened. 
RIKER: Where is Mister Barclay? It's past fourteen hundred hours. 
LAFORGE: Lieutenant Barclay, report to the Bridge. Lieutenant Barclay,
report. 
RIKER: Computer. Locate Lieutenant Barclay. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay is in holodeck two. 
LAFORGE: I'll get him. 
RIKER: No, I'll handle this. I've had it with him. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor, you'd better come along.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: I think you should know Barclay's been
running some unique programs. 
RIKER: I don't care what he's been running. I just ran out of patience.

[Holodeck - Glade]

(They find the three musketeers and the blue boy by
the folly) 
LAFORGE: Like I said, Commander, Barclay's been running some unusual
programs. 
RIKER: This is a violation of protocol. Crewmembers should not be
simulated in the holodeck. 
LAFORGE: Commander I don't think there's any regulation against 
RIKER: Well there ought to be. Computer, discontinue programme and
erase. 
TROI: Computer, belay that order. 
RIKER: Counsellor? 
TROI: If Barclay is having difficulty facing reality, to suddenly
destroy his only means of escape would be brutal and could do
considerable damage. 
HOLO-PICARD: They are quite disagreeable, aren't they? Shall we have at
them? 
HOLO-DATA: Delighted. 
HOLO-LAFORGE: We shall thrash them. 
HOLO-PICARD: En garde. 
RIKER: Stop it. Put that down. 
HOLO-DATA: Your sword, sir. 
RIKER: I don't have a sword. 
HOLO-LAFORGE: How do expect to fight without your sword, sir? 
RIKER: I don't expect to fight. 
HOLO-PICARD: Ha! Do I detect a streak of yellow along the good fellow's
back? Perhaps we can supply a more appropriate adversary for him.
Number One! 
WESLEY: Number One! 
HOLO-RIKER: Here I come. 
(Enter a much reduced version of Riker) 
HOLO-RIKER: Am I late? Did I miss the fight? En garde! You, sir, you
have a familiar bearing. Is it possible our swords have crossed
somewhere before? 
RIKER: Where is he? Where's Barclay? 
HOLO-RIKER: Ah, a personal grudge. I warn you. It would be wise for you
to put your affairs in final order before you meet him in combat. You
challenge the greatest sword in all the holodeck. 
RIKER: You think this is funny? 
TROI: You are very tall. It might be threatening to some people. 
RIKER: Mister Barclay will find out what it means to be threatened.
Computer, discontinue image of Riker. 
HOLO-PICARD: Sir, you have no sense of fair play. 
LAFORGE: Just tell us where to find Barclay. 
(The musketeers sit down instead) 
RIKER: You want us to search through all this to find him? 
TROI: It could provide us with valuable information about what's
troubling him. You know, there's nothing wrong with a healthy fantasy
life, as long as you don't let it take over. 
RIKER: You call this healthy? 
TROI: You're taking it so seriously. It's not without its element of
humour. 
HOLO-TROI: I am the goddess of Empathy. Cast off your inhibitions and
embrace love, truth, joy. 
LAFORGE: Oh, my God. 
HOLO-TROI: Discard your facades and reveal your true being to me. 
TROI: Computer, discontinue. 
RIKER: Computer, belay that order! We want to get more insight into
what's been troubling the poor man, remember? Quite a healthy fantasy
life, wouldn't you say? 
(Geordi agrees)
