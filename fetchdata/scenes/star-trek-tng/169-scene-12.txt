[Bridge]

(Geordi is at a rear station, showing Riker the
glass) 
LAFORGE: I wouldn't bother you with something this minor, Commander,
but it may be a symptom of a more serious problem. 
RIKER: Do you think we'll need to put in to a starbase? 
LAFORGE: We'll have a better idea after Mister Barclay runs a check on
the power systems. 
DATA: It was Lieutenant Barclay who first suggested a link between the
two incidents. 
BARCLAY: What? No, it wasn't. I mean, not really. 
PICARD: Will your investigation affect our available power during the
mission? 
BARCLAY: No, No, sir. We'll have to shut off some systems. We'll shut
them down a few at a time. It shouldn't. I don't think so. 
PICARD: Good. I look forward to your report, Mister Broccoli. (big
silence) Barclay. 
BARCLAY: If you will excuse me. 
(Barclay leaves) 
DATA: Metathesis is one of the most common of pronunciation errors,
sir. A reversal of vowel and consonant, Barc to Broc. 
(Suddenly Data becomes fascinated by something on a control panel)

[Ten Forward]

GUINAN: Yes, I know him comes in. He stands at the
bar. He doesn't say much. He orders a warm milk. 
LAFORGE: Figures. 
GUINAN: Warm milk helps you sleep, La Forge. You should try it. What's
this have to do with Barclay? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I'm just trying to figure the man out. Do you
ever talk to him? 
GUINAN: He doesn't talk much. 
LAFORGE: Does he have any friends? 
GUINAN: Not that I've seen. 
LAFORGE: What do you do with a guy like that? 
GUINAN: Well, I just serve him warm milk and let him be. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky. I can't let him be. He's my
problem. 
GUINAN: Well, he's imaginative. 
LAFORGE: How do you know that? 
GUINAN: I know. 
LAFORGE: Well, then maybe he's in the wrong line of work. 
GUINAN: You engineering types don't appreciate imagination? 
LAFORGE: That's not it, Guinan. He just doesn't fit in here. 
GUINAN: Terkim. 
LAFORGE: What? 
GUINAN: Reminds me of Terkim. My mother's brother. Sort of the family
misfit. Everybody told me to stay away from him. Bad influence. 
LAFORGE: Did you? 
GUINAN: Are you kidding? He was the only member of the family who had a
sense of humour. Except no one ever stayed around him long enough to
realize it but me. My mother tells me I remind her of him, and I
probably do. The idea of fitting in just repels me. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I'm not make myself clear, Guinan. Barclay, well, he's
always late. The man's nervous. Nobody wants to be around this guy. 
GUINAN: If I felt that nobody wanted to be around me, I'd probably be
late and nervous too. 
LAFORGE: Guinan, that's not the point. 
GUINAN: Are you sure? Excuse me. 
LAFORGE: Computer, where is Lieutenant Barclay?

[Holodeck - Glade]

LAFORGE: Reg? 
(He comes upon a Gainsborough tableau - Beverly on a floral swing and
Wesley in blue, eating cake. There's a white parakeet in a cane cage
too) 
LAFORGE: Beverly? 
CRUSHER: Good morning, my lord. Manners, my son. Manners. You embarrass
me before our guest. Master Barclay will spank you if you misbehave. 
LAFORGE: Wesley ? 
WESLEY: What do you want? 
LAFORGE: Well, I guess I want Master Barclay. 
CRUSHER: The boys got into another little scrap, I'm afraid. But boys
will be boys. 
(A swordfight enters, with much clashing of swords. three musketeers
versus Barclay) 
LAFORGE: You cannot withstand our assault forever, Barclay. 
DATA: You are outnumbered, Mister Barclay. Say you will yield and it
ends here. 
BARCLAY: I will speak with my sword, sir. 
PICARD: In God's name, where did you learn to fight like this, man? 
BARCLAY: Self taught, my capitaine. Shall I give you a few lessons? 
(Naturally, Barclay is completely victorious) 
PICARD: Who is that? One of your allies? 
BARCLAY: Jean-Luc. Not that old trick. I'm very disappointed in you. 
(Geordi coughs, Reg turns, and the bottom falls out of his world)
