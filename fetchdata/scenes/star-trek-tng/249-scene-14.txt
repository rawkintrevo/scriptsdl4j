KAHLESS CRUSHER GOWRON WORF COMPUTER

[Sickbay]

(Crusher scans the bloodied dagger) 
CRUSHER: There, that should do it. Computer, run a genetic comparison
on this blood sample and the tissue belonging to Kahless. 
COMPUTER: The genetic patterns are identical. 
GOWRON: But how? How can this be? 
WORF: It is true. Kahless has returned.

[Kahless' quarters]

(Kahless and Worf share a drink) 
WORF: I am sorry. Our replicators do not do justice to Klingon Warnog. 
KAHLESS: It has been so long since I have tasted any food or drink.
There are many things I have forgotten. 
WORF: Kahless, may I ask you about death and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me, what
awaits us beyond this life. 
KAHLESS: I do not have those answers. I am merely a traveller, someone
who has journeyed back and forth between this world and the next. While
I am in this form, I know only about this world. And there is much work
for me to do in this world, and you will be part of it, Worf. 
WORF: Me? 
KAHLESS: It was your purity of heart that summoned me back from
Sto-Vo-Kor, and Koroth has told me about the respect you have earned in
the Federation and the Empire. I want you to have a place at my side as
we restore honour to our people. Let me tell you about this new Empire
we will forge.
