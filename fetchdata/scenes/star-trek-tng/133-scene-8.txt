TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI O'BRIEN [OC]
said counsellor results chief contact place suspended child infected

[Observation lounge]

WORF: I recommend against contact, Captain. 
PICARD: Number One? 
RIKER: I have to agree, sir. I wish there was something we could do,
but the risk is too great. 
PICARD: Doctor? 
PULASKI: If the children are free of disease, as Doctor Kingsley said,
they should be evacuated. I would like to bring one of them aboard
within a force field for a complete examination. 
PICARD: Counsellor, do you sense anything? 
TROI: Doctor Kingsley sincerely believes the children are not a threat,
but she's not telling us the whole truth. I recommend caution. 
PICARD: We have only Doctor Kingsley's assurance that these children
are not infected, whereas we have seen the results of this disease
first hand. In a case like this, I think we should err on the side of
caution.
PULASKI: All right. We could beam up one child in styrolite in
suspended animation. That way I could scan for possible infection
without any danger to ourselves or to the child. 
RIKER: But we don't know what we're looking for. 
PULASKI: Exactly. And we won't know until we begin gathering data.
Captain, that's worth some risk. 
PICARD: There's always risk, Doctor. Proceed with the examination, but
I shall require positive proof that these children are harmless before
I place any of my crew in jeopardy.

[Science lab]

LAFORGE: The forcefield's ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Activate it. 
(The forcefield goes up around a single examination table in the middle
of the room) 
PICARD: Transporter? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: This is Chief O'Brien, sir. Almost ready. 
PICARD: Is there a problem?
