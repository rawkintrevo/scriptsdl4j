TROI LIATOR PICARD RIVAN EDO CHIEF CRUSHER

[Council Chamber]

TROI: (whispers) Wesley. 
PICARD: Stand by. Picard out. I want to speak to her personally about
her son. So you promise that Wesley Crusher is safe until sundown? 
LIATOR: You have our word. 
PICARD: Then, will one of you return with me to our vessel? 
RIVAN: Of course. I'll go as a hostage for the boy's safety. 
PICARD: No, no, no. That's not it. I want you to identify something for
me, if you can. Captain to Transporter Room. Three to beam up. 
(Picard, Troi and Rivan move away from the group) 
RIVAN: I'm frightened. 
TROI: There's no reason to be. 
PICARD: Transporter Room, energise.

[Corridor]

RIVAN: But this is a city. A great city. 
CRUSHER: Captain, I've just seen the away team report about Wesley. 
PICARD: In a moment, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: In a moment? 
PICARD: Exactly. In a moment. You were about to say? 
RIVAN: Since you have all this power, why be concerned about our laws?
You could take the boy from us. 
PICARD: It's not that simple. From the starboard lounge, you can see
whatever is outside this vessel. 
RIVAN: Do you mean my world? You said we'd be high above it. 
PICARD: And something else that's circling your world. It's very
important to us, and perhaps to you, to know what it is. 
[Lounge]

(As soon as Rivan sees the other vessel, she drops
to her knees, head bowed) 
PICARD: I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was necessary. Do you know what that
is? 
TROI: Can you tell us what it is? 
PICARD: Is it God? (she nods) Now, it's very important you answer
something. How do you recognise what it is? 
TROI: Nothing will harm you, I promise. Just tell us how you recognise
it. 
RIVAN: It has appeared before. 
PICARD: Can you speak to it? Does it speak to you? 
TROI: Captain! 
(The vessel becomes even more visible) 
EDO [OC]: Return my child. 
CRUSHER: Return? 
TROI: It's coming toward us. 
PICARD: Picard to Transporter Room, come in. 
(He puts his comm. badge on Rivan) 
TROI: Yes, do that. But hurry! 
CRUSHER: It's still coming toward us. 
CHIEF [OC]: Transporter Chief to Captain. 
PICARD: One to beam down to away team location. Hurry! Engage!
Transporter Room. Urgent! Engage! 
(And Rivan is beamed away. The Edo vessel backs off) 
CRUSHER: It seems the Edo's god is very protective of its children. 
PICARD: I had no choice but to learn about that thing from her. I'm
sorry I had to. She was so frightened. 
TROI: It's understandable, sir. Sharing an orbit with God is no small
experience. 
PICARD: Let's go see your patient, Doctor. 
[Corridor]

CRUSHER: What do you intend to do about my son? 
PICARD: He's being held safely until sundown. 
CRUSHER: When he faces execution! Although he's committed no crime,
certainly none that any sane and reasonable person would 
PICARD: You saw what that thing was about to do. 
CRUSHER: I apologise, sir, but this is very difficult for me. If he
were your son, you'd be as frightened 
PICARD: But I am. 
CRUSHER: Data is in Sickbay here. You'll find him able to talk to you.
