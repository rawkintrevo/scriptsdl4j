LAFORGE [OC]: We're lucky the hull is still in one
piece. 
PICARD: This little nuisance is beginning to lose its fascination. 
DATA: Sir, during our attempt to break away, I recorded a momentary
alteration of the movement pattern within the cluster. 
RIKER: You think we got their attention, Data? 
DATA: Perhaps, but just for an instant. The pattern immediately
returned to its previous dynamic. 
PICARD: Follow up on it, Mister Data. Input your observations into the
Universal Translator. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Perhaps the movements themselves are an attempt at
communication.

GUINAN: (sneaking up from behind) More tea? I
didn't mean to startle you. 
TROI: That's alright. I'm getting used to it. 
GUINAN: May I? 
TROI: Sure. 
(Guinan sits with her) 
GUINAN: Are you really getting used to it? 
TROI: No. 
GUINAN: Do you want to talk about it? 
TROI: No. 
GUINAN: Good. I get so tired of people coming in with their problems.
They come in, they want a shoulder to cry on, and generally it turns
out to be mine. 
TROI: You'd make a good counsellor. 
GUINAN: I think so too. So I'm going to talk to Picard about it. 
TROI: About what? You becoming counsellor? 
GUINAN: Well, yes, you're leaving. That means there won't be a
counsellor on board, and I suppose I'm going to have a very long line
at that bar. It would be nice to have a nice office, too. 
TROI: It's more than just letting them cry on your shoulder. It takes
an enormous commitment. 
GUINAN: I can do that. 
TROI: Guinan, people come to you to talk about things they want to
reveal. As ship's counsellor, you have to get them to talk about things
they don't want to reveal. 
GUINAN: I could do that too. 
TROI: What are you? You don't really want to be ship's counsellor. 
GUINAN: What would make you say that? 
TROI: I just know you're not serious. 
GUINAN: Have I given you any indication that I might not serious? 
TROI: Not really, but 
GUINAN: Then how do you know? Are your empathic abilities coming back? 
TROI: No. I suppose it's just instinctive. I get it. You're trying to
make me see that I have other abilities to draw on. Human intuition,
instincts. Guinan, those skills only develop after years of experience.
It's not that easy. 
GUINAN: No one said it was easy. It's much harder than you think. Human
intuition and instinct are not always right, but they do make life
interesting. 
TROI: So I'm discovering.
