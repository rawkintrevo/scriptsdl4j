LEAH: We can save a lot of energy just by improving
engine efficiency. 
LAFORGE: We've run into similar problems before. That's actually why I
reoriented the dilithium crystal. 
LEAH: And why you added the mid-range phase adjusters? 
LAFORGE: Right. 
LEAH: Commander it seems that you've made a lot more modifications than
I'm aware of. Do you have a file on all the work you've done? 
LAFORGE: It's in the computer. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: La Forge here. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander, I need to see you on the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: On my way, Captain. You go on ahead, Doctor. Ensign Palvik can
show you the file on the engine modifications.

LEAH: Phase coils upgraded to fifty five field
densities. Plasma inducers interlinked with generator. Ensign, would
there be any other files with data on the original engine
specifications? 
PAVLIK: (a young woman) I believe so, Doctor. 
(file 9140, holographic simulation) 
LEAH: This file utilises the prototype engine schematic. 
PAVLIK: It's a holographic programme, set in the drafting room at
Utopia Planitia. 
LEAH: I'll run it on holodeck three.
