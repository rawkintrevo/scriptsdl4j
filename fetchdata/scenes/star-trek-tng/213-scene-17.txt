RIKER LAFORGE HANNAH PICARD FELTON DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Bring us within range of the fragment,
Ensign. 
FELTON: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You may proceed

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Good luck. 
HANNAH: You, too. 
LAFORGE: Engage tractor beam. Okay, let's give it a try. Shutting down
non-critical systems. 
HANNAH: Emitter circuits one hundred seventy percent over standard. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Increasing impulse power to tractor emitters.
EPS power levels rising. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Transferring warp power to tractor beam
generator. 
HANNAH: Graviton generators operating normally. Surge pulse now
synchronised. Emitters radiating at three hundred twenty percent over
standard. 
LAFORGE: Bridge, we need more power.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Reduce life support to minimum requirements,
Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Engineering]

HANNAH: Three hundred ninety percent over standard.

LAFORGE: Come on, come on. 
HANNAH: No change in the fragment's course. 
LAFORGE: We've got to increase the pulse frequency. 
HANNAH: The emitter circuits won't hold for long. 
LAFORGE: We won't need them for long. 
HANNAH: Four hundred percent over standard. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Now we're getting there. 
HANNAH: The fragment's moved point four degrees off its previous
heading. Point six five. It's working.
