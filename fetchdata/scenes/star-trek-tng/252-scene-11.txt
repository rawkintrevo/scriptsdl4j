[Brig]

CRUSHER: I've stabilised his condition. He's still
pretty weak, but he should make a full recovery. 
PICARD: Can you waken him? 
CRUSHER: Yes, but it's very risky. His heart rate and blood pressure
are
up 
PICARD: Do it. 
CRUSHER: All right. 
PICARD: Lower the forcefield. 
(Worf and Crusher leave the cell and the Borg sits up) 
PICARD: What is your designation? 
GUEST4: I do not have a designation. My name is Crosis. 
PICARD: Crosis? How did you get that name? 
GUEST4: It was given to me by the One. 
PICARD: Who is that? 
GUEST4: The One who will destroy you. 
PICARD: But you are Borg. Your goal is not to destroy but to assimilate
us into the collective. 
GUEST4: We do not assimilate inferior biological organisms. We destroy
them. 
PICARD: Tell me more about this One. Does he have a name? Is he called
Hugh? 
GUEST4: Klingon. Shatter the cranial exoskeleton at the tricipital
lobe. Death is immediate. 
PICARD: Why must this One destroy biological organisms? 
GUEST4: Human. Sever spinal cord at third vertebrae. Death is
immediate. 
PICARD: I am Locutus of Borg. You will respond to my questions. This is
going nowhere. Doctor, I want an autopsy performed on the other one.
Compare the differences with what we learned of Hugh's anatomy. See if
there have been any recent modifications which might explain these
behavioural differences. Data, run a biospectral analysis on this Borg.
See if he is trying to send a subspace signal to the others. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(everyone else leaves) 
GUEST4: You are not like the others. You do not have to be destroyed.
You can be assimilated. 
DATA: I do not wish to be assimilated. 
GUEST4: Resistance is futile. You will not resist what you've wanted
all your life. I was like you once. Without feeling. But the One helped
me. He can help you too. He can help you find emotion. Have you ever
felt a real emotion, Data? 
DATA: Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was forced to kill a Borg. I got angry. 
GUEST4: How did it feel to get angry? Did it give you pleasure? 
DATA: It would be unethical to take pleasure from another being's
death. 
GUEST4: You didn't answer my question. Did it feel good to kill? 
DATA: Yes. 
GUEST4: If it is unethical to take pleasure from another being's death,
you must be a very unethical person. 
DATA: No. That is not correct. My creator Doctor Soong, gave me a
programme which defines my sense of right and wrong. In essence, I have
a conscience. 
GUEST4: It didn't seem to be functioning on Ohniaka Three when you felt
pleasure in killing that Borg. 
DATA: Step away from the forcefield. Your proximity is interfering with
my scan. 
GUEST4: You enjoyed it. That surge of emotion inside you as you watched
the life drain from your victim. It was unlike anything you've ever
felt before. 
DATA: It was a very potent experience. 
GUEST4: You'd like to feel that way again. 
DATA: Yes. 
GUEST4: You'd do anything to feel that way again, even if it meant
killing someone. 
DATA: No. That would not be ethical. 
GUEST4: You don't sound very sure of yourself. Is your ethical
programme functioning? Data? Do you have a friend? 
DATA: Yes. His name is Geordi. 
GUEST4: If it meant that you could feel emotions again the way you did
on Ohniaka Three, would you kill your friend? Would you kill Geordi? 
DATA: Yes. I would.
