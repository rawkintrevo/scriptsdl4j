PICARD RIKER HUTCHINSON DATA CRUSHER

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: To him and transport directly to
Sickbay? 
HUTCHINSON: I'll try, Captain, but there's a lot of shielding to pull
him through.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Sickbay here, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: Prepare for emergency transport. 
CRUSHER: Yes, sir. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher out. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker.

[Vico]

PICARD [OC]: Is the boy ready, Number One? 
RIKER: Ready, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: It's your signal. 
RIKER: Aye, Captain. It's going to be okay. Here we go. Energise.

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Ensign, do we have him? 
HUTCHINSON: The lock is holding. I just can't resolve the matter
stream, not with all that victurium alloy in the way.

[Vico]

HUTCHINSON [OC]: Commander Riker. You'll have to
get him out into the corridor. 
DATA: I could move the beam, sir. However, it may initiate the collapse
of the surrounding supports. I recommend you and Geordi return to the
ship. 
RIKER: Agreed. La Forge. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and La Forge are beamed in) 
HUTCHINSON: I'm locked onto Commander Data and the boy, sir. I'll
energise as soon as they've cleared the bulkheads. 
RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Data. 
DATA [OC]: Yes, sir.
