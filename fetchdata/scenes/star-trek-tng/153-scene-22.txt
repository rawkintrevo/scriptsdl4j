MARLA PICARD RIKER JEREMY WORF

[Jeremy's quarters]

(Jeremy recoils from Marla's attempt to stroke his
hair) 
JEREMY: They said you were dead. 
MARLA: There was a mistake. It's okay. 
JEREMY: But there was an explosion. You were hurt. 
MARLA: I'm fine. You mustn't think any more about this. The important
thing is I'm never going to leave you again. I think somebody needs a
hug. 
(He's reluctant at first, but lets her hold him) 
MARLA: We have to go now. 
JEREMY: Where? 
MARLA: To the planet. That's where we're going to live now. 
JEREMY: We're not going to stay on the Enterprise any more? 
MARLA: No. We're going to live in a home just like we used to on Earth.
You'll see. I promise. 
(The doorbell chimes, and Jeremy answers it) 
JEREMY: Lieutenant Worf! Did they tell you? It was a mistake. She
didn't die. She's alive. 
WORF: Jeremy, come here. 
MARLA: Lieutenant Worf. It's all right. I'm here for the boy. 
WORF: Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Go ahead. 
WORF [OC]: Lieutenant Aster is in her quarters. 
RIKER: Repeat, Worf? 
[Jeremy's quarters]

WORF: Lieutenant Aster is here. In her quarters
with the boy. 
PICARD [OC]: Do not provoke her 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Or interfere in any way until I arrive.
Picard out. Number One, have Security moving that way but tell them to
keep their distance. You have the Bridge. Counsellor.
