CRUSHER: They've been oxygen deprived. There doesn't seem to be any
significant damage. Prepare some dexalin. 
MEDIC: Yes, Doctor. 
KRITE: Commander, thank you. 
RIKER: Your colleague Soren was very helpful. 
KRITE: Captain, would you all join us this evening? We would like to
express our gratitude. 
PICARD: We'd be happy to. 
KRITE: Noor will be eager to get a first hand report. We should return
to the surface. 
SOREN: I will see you later tonight, Commander.

SOREN: There you are, Commander. I wondered what
had happened to our guest of honour. 
RIKER: I just needed some air. I can only take so much of these social
functions, and then I need to breathe a little. 
SOREN: I would think you had attended so many affairs like this that it
would become second nature to you. 
RIKER: I was raised outdoors. I'm never been very comfortable in
crowded rooms. 
SOREN: What do you think of our planet? Isn't it beautiful? 
RIKER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. 
SOREN: We have many varieties of plant life. Perhaps you would like to
inspect some of them? 
RIKER: Yes, I would. I've always been interested in exobotany. 
SOREN: Please, let me take you on a tour. 
RIKER: Thank you. It's kind of you.
