RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, sensors indicate a disturbance near
the outpost on Melona Four. 
PICARD: What kind of disturbance? 
WORF: I cannot tell. We are still too far away. It could be an
electrical storm. 
PICARD: See if you can contact the colony. 
WORF: Aye, sir. Captain, there is no response from Melona colony, but
the disturbance in the atmosphere is increasing. 
PICARD: How far are we? 
WORF: At current speed, twenty seven hours. 
PICARD: Bridge to La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, Captain. 
PICARD: Are you picking up any readings from Melona?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Something strange is going on.
There are violent disruptions in the atmosphere. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign, increase to warp eight.

[Melona colony]

RIKER: Come on, keep moving. 
[Cave]

(with a convenient flight of steps downwards) 
CRUSHER: Watch your step but keep moving. 
RIKER: Let's go, let's go. Keep moving. Deeper into the cave. Come on.
Deeper into the cave. Keep moving. 
(the last of the survivors are in) 
RIKER: How much protection will this cave give us? 
DATA: The refractory metal in the rock formations may act as an
effective barrier. 
RIKER: Let's seal off this entrance. 
(they use their phasers to make a rockfall that blocks the entity's
ray) 
CRUSHER: Let's hope there's enough air in here. 
RIKER: There's got to be a ventilation source somewhere. We need some
light. 
(the devastation can be heard going on outside as Riker and Data use
the phasers to make the ceiling glow) 
RIKER: How are the others? 
CRUSHER: Just scrapes and bruises, I think. I'll check further. Where's
Carmen? 
RIKER: She didn't make it. She was trying to save an old man who'd
fallen. 
CRUSHER: I'm sorry. 
RIKER: I think we're going to be all right in here. I'm not sure about
the air supply, so stay put, don't move around. Don't expend
unnecessary energy. With any luck, we'll be able to wait this thing
out. 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Riker to Enterprise. 
DATA: Commander, the refractory metals in the rock strata may also
interfere with communication. 
RIKER: Data we've only seen the Crystalline Entity once before. How do
you know these metals will protect us? 
DATA: I am not entirely certain they will, sir. 
RIKER: I was afraid you were going to say something like that.
