[Cave]

DATA: Doctor, there is evidence of residual
bitrious matter in the soil. It was not present before the Entity's
attack. 
(she keeps walking away, scanning) 
DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr, you have made it clear that my presence
disturbs you. However, I do not see how we can achieve our task if you
continue to ignore me. 
MARR: Commander, I can hear everything you say to me. If there is
anything worth my response, you can be sure I will not be silent. 
DATA: Then I do not understand your lack of interest in the bitrious
filament I mentioned. 
MARR: It's old news to me. I found evidence of bitrium on the last
three attack sites. It seems to be a residual that the Entity produces
after it absorbs living matter. I'm actually more interested in this
cave. It still amazes me that your group was spared. 
DATA: As I have speculated, the presence of refractory metals 
MARR: Refractory metals. Yes, I know. On two separate occasions
settlers sought refuge in caves. Some of them deeper than this one.
They perished anyway. 
DATA: Were those caves laced with kelbonite or fistrium? 
MARR: The tunnels on Forlat Three had strong deposits of kelbonite,
yes. 
DATA: Then perhaps the combination of the two metals prevented the
Entity from 
MARR: Perhaps it was you. 
DATA: I do not understand. 
MARR: Maybe it was your presence which made the Entity pass over the
people in this cave. Did that occur to you? 
DATA: I cannot see what effect my being here would have had 
MARR: If you had been in contact with the Entity, if that's the reason
Melona was attacked, it surely wouldn't have killed its ally. 
DATA: Do you believe that I lured the Entity here? 
MARR: Did you? 
DATA: No, Doctor. Because Lore betrayed the colonists on Omicron Theta,
you believe that I am capable of the same behaviour. You are mistaken,
Doctor. My programming is distinctly different from Lore's. 
MARR: You don't understand. I am accusing you of collaborating with
that monster! 
DATA: I do understand, and I am attempting to explain to you it is
impossible. 
MARR: It's amazing. You can't feel anything, can you? Nothing I say to
you hurts you. 
DATA: That is true, Doctor. 
MARR: I'm getting a slight elevation on monocaladium particulates in
this cave wall. Are you making note of it? 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. 
MARR: My son died on Omicron Theta. He was sixteen when the colony was
attacked. That is the reason I have became an expert on the Crystalline
Entity. I have spent my life studying it, tracking it, and hoping
someday to find it. And if I learn you have been helping that thing in
any way whatsoever, I will see to it that you are disassembled piece by
piece.
