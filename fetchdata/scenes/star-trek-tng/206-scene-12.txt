PICARD RIKER CRUSHER LAFORGE
control doctor complaining cells negative analysis condition came shows

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He came in complaining of a servo
malfunction but my scans came out negative. Then he just collapsed. 
PICARD: What have you found? 
CRUSHER: His biosystems and positronic functions seem to check out, and
his power cells are active. 
LAFORGE: From what I can tell, his higher functions are intact, but the
signals aren't getting from his brain to the rest of his body. It's
like he's in a coma. 
RIKER: Data performs self diagnostic routines on a regular basis. We
should take a look at his logs. They may reveal something. 
LAFORGE: I recommend going through his quarters, as well. You never
know what we might find. 
PICARD: Agreed. Continue the analysis. Keep me informed.

[Data's quarters]

RIKER: Standard security sweep shows nothing out of
the ordinary. 
LAFORGE: Personal logs, diagnostics, duty logs, they all appear normal.
There's no evidence of anything that could lead to Data's shutdown. 
RIKER: Maybe we should ask his cat. 
LAFORGE: I guess I'd better get back to Sickbay, see if there's any
change in his condition. 
RIKER: Doctor Crusher's got everything under control, Geordi. If
there's any change, you'll be the first to know. 
LAFORGE: I guess so. 
RIKER: Looks to me like you need a break. Unwind a little. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, maybe you're right. 
RIKER: I've got just the thing. Why don't you join me in Ten Forward?
There's something I'd like you to try.
