WORF: Routine deep sensor probe indicates no
obstacles or vessels within a range of three light years. 
TASHA: Confirm. 
WORF: The martial arts competition is in three days. Are you prepared? 
TASHA: I will be if you'll meet me on the holodeck later. I need your
help on the Mishiama wrist-lock and break. If it works on you, I can
use it on anyone. 
WORF: A valid assumption. Who is your first competitor? 
TASHA: Science Officer Swenson. 
WORF: You will defeat him easily. 
TASHA: I'm more concerned with Lieutenant Minnerly's kick boxing. 
WORF: You are favoured in the ship's pool. 
TASHA: You bet on me? 
WORF: A sure thing. 
LAFORGE: Captain, estimated rendezvous with the shuttle in one hour and
ten minutes. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: It'll be good to have Counsellor Troi back, won't it, Number
One? 
RIKER: It certainly will. 
WORF: Sir, I'm receiving an emergency transmission from the shuttle. 
PICARD: On main viewer. 
TASHA: I can't, sir. We're receiving audio only. 
PICARD: Open the frequency. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
PRIETO [OC]: What a jolt! 
RIKER: Position report. 
PRIETO [OC]: Sir, I have an onboard systems failure. You'll have to
tell me where I am. 
LAFORGE: I read your coordinates at three seven zero point two three
six. Confirm. 
PRIETO [OC]: I can't confirm. My instruments are haywire. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Prieto, is Counsellor Troi all right? 
PRIETO [OC]: Yes, sir. Just a little shaken. We're being buffeted a
bit. Losing more power! My flight control computer's fried. 
PICARD: Main Engineering. 
LYNCH [OC]: Lieutenant Commander Leland T. Lynch here, sir. 
PICARD: How long before we can return to warp power?
