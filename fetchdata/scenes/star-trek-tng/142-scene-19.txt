DATA: According to these coordinates, we have
travelled seven thousand light years 
[Ten Forward]

DATA [OC]: And are located near the system J two
five.
RIKER: Travel time to the nearest starbase?
DATA [OC]: At maximum warp, in two years, seven months, three days,
eighteen hours we would reach Starbase one eight five.
RIKER: Why?
Q: Why? Why, to give you a taste of your future, a preview of things to
come. Con permiso, Capitan. The hall
is rented, the orchestra engaged. It's now time to see if you can dance.
(Q vanishes) 
PICARD: Guinan, your people have been in this part of the galaxy. 
GUINAN: Yes.
RIKER: What can you tell us?
GUINAN: Only that if I were you, I'd start back now.

Captain's log, stardate 42761.9. Despite Guinan's
warning, I feel compelled to investigate this unexplored sector of the
galaxy before heading back.

WORF: Captain, the sixth planet in the system is
Class M.
DATA: There is a system of roads on this planet, which indicates a
highly industrialised civilisation. But where there should be cities
there are only great rips in the surface.
WORF: It is as though some great force just scooped all the machine
elements off the face of the planet.
DATA: It is identical to what happened to the outposts along the
Neutral Zone.
WORF: Captain, we are being probed.
RIKER: What is the source of the probe?
WORF: A ship. It is on an intercept course.
PICARD: On screen. Magnify.
(A cube is sailing through space) 
RIKER: Full scan. 
PICARD: Go to Yellow Alert.
WORF: Going to Yellow Alert.
RIKER: Keep the shields down. We don't want to appear provocative. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, what can you tell us?
DATA: The ship is strangely generalised in design. There is no specific
bridge, no command centre. There is no engineering section. I can
identify no living quarters.
RIKER: Life signs?
DATA: There is no indication of life.
RIKER: Lieutenant Worf, what is its alert status?
WORF: I detect no shields, no weapons of any known design.
PICARD: Hailing frequencies.
WORF: Open.
PICARD: This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise.
WORF: No response.
PICARD: This is Captain Picard representing the United Federation of
Planets. Guinan.

PICARD [OC]: Activate your viewscreen. I would like
you to monitor what's going on up here. I may need your input.

[Guinan's office]

(Just down the corridor from Ten Forward) 
GUINAN: I'm here, Captain.
