(This module of the ship contains frost-covered
capsules in groups of three, both sides of the passageway. Data scrapes
the frost off the first to view a skull) 
DATA: The seal was broken and the environment has been corrupted. 
WORF: Here's another. 
DATA: This one is empty. 
WORF: Commander, look at this. 
(They look at the face of a woman. Other capsules reveal two men still
intact) 
WORF: Were they frozen for an extended journey? 
DATA: If that were the purpose, there would be evidence of a more
sophisticated monitoring system. These containers were designed solely
for refrigeration.

the Enterprise immediately.

people on board. Frozen.
