believe leer daimon huh choice cell starfleet removed nibor

[Holding cell]

(They wake up in a large cell with a forcefield at
the entrance. Two Ferengi are playing 3D chess outside) 
RIKER: Lwaxana? Deanna? 
LWAXANA: Where are we? 
RIKER: From the smell of things, I'd say we're aboard a Ferengi vessel.

LWAXANA: The Ferengi can't do that. You're Starfleet officers. 
RIKER: Tog must have missed that chapter in the Ferengi book of
Etiquette. (taps his comm. badge) Enterprise? Must be too far out of
range. 
(Riker tests the forcefield - it hurts) 
NIBOR: DaiMon, they have regained consciousness. 
TOG [OC]: Very good. 
(Deanna and Lwaxana are beamed away, and their dresses fall empty to
the floor) 
[Tog's quarters]

LWAXANA: I should have known. Even their
transporters can't be trusted. 
TROI: Why have you removed our clothing? 
FAREK: Females do not deserve the honour of clothing. 
LWAXANA: They're as bad as humans. Look at the leer on his face. 
TOG: No. His is an expression of revulsion. But it is a feeling that I
do not share, Lwaxana. 
(Lwaxana picks up a couple of bedsheets or something, and hands one to
Deanna. They wrap them around themselves) 
LWAXANA: Well, it's cold in here. Do you want me to become ill? 
TOG: You must forgive the doctor. He is not accustomed to dealing with
Betazoid females. Now, Lwaxana, I have a business proposition for you. 
LWAXANA: Thanks, but I'm not interested in any of your propositions. 
TOG: Hear me out. Your telepathic powers could bring us both great
profit. 
LWAXANA: Huh. Why would I want to bring you profit? 
FAREK: In order to keep your daughter alive and healthy, for one. 
TOG: There's no need for threats. Lwaxana is a sensible female 
TROI [telepath]: I don't like the sound of this, mother. 
LWAXANA [telepath]: I believe I can control him, Little One. 
LWAXANA: I'm sure we can talk about this. Just the two of us. 
TOG: A wise choice. Farek, leave us. And you may rejoin your friend. 
TROI [telepath]: Mother, are you sure? 
LWAXANA [telepath]: I'll be fine. 
(Deanna vanishes) 
TOG: And now, Lwaxana Troi, let us talk. 
(He presses a button and a bed slides out from the wall)
