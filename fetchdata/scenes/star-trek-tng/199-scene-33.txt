PICARD RIKER MCKNIGHT DATA OBRIEN

[Bridge]

RIKER: I'll do my pre-flight once I'm on board. 
PICARD: Not this time, Will. I want you on the Bridge. 
RIKER: Sir? 
PICARD: I'm going to pilot the shuttle. 
RIKER: Captain, it's my duty as First Officer to safeguard the lives on
this ship, including yours. The Enterprise can't afford to lose you,
sir. Certainly not in this situation. 
PICARD: I believe our best chance of escaping this situation is for me
to pilot the shuttle. It's my ship, Will. I've got to do this. 
RIKER: Sir.

kilometres.

lock on to the Captain's communicator. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: I want to be able to pull him out of
there in case we have to. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir.
