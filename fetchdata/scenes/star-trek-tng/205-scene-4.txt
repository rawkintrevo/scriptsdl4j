TROI OBRIEN PATTERSON JAYGORDON PICARD MANDEL MONROE

[Turbolift]

PICARD: I want you to know we're very proud of the
science fair winners. Perhaps some of you will choose to pursue a
career in Starfleet. Well, then. What did you do for your science
projects? 
PATTERSON: I planted radishes in this special dirt and they came up all
weird! 
PICARD: I see. That's very, very commendable. And you? 
JAY GORDON: An analysis of the life span of the swarming moths of Gonal
Four. They only live for twenty hours, then they all die. 
PICARD: How interesting. And you 
(but before the shy girl can answer, something happens)
PICARD: We're falling! 
(all over the ship, power drops and everything is shaken violently. Red
Alert goes off automatically)

[Bridge]

MONROE: (female helm) What happened? 
MANDEL: (man at ops) Sensors are picking up subspace distortions and
high energy particles directly to starboard. 
MONROE: Looks like we ran into a quantum filament. Damage report? 
O'BRIEN: We've lost primary life support. Switching to secondary
systems. Impulse and warp engines are offline. 
MANDEL: There's another filament moving toward us, sir. 
MONROE: All decks brace for impact! 
(Thump! and it all goes dark - except for the opening titles) 
O'BRIEN: Counsellor? 
TROI: I'm all right. Medical team to the Bridge. Troi to Sickbay.
Counsellor Troi to Captain Picard. Troi to Engineering. Counsellor Troi
to any crew member, please acknowledge. 
(Mandel tries to open the turbolift doors) 
TROI: Medical team to the Bridge. 
O'BRIEN: The computer's down. It looks like we still have impulse power
but not much else. 
TROI: Lieutenant Monroe! 
(She's dead) 
MANDEL: Chief O'Brien. The turbolifts aren't working. We're trapped up
here.
