PULASKI TROI DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Corridor]

WORF: I do not enjoy riddles, Counsellor. 
TROI: You will enjoy this one. 
WORF: I am in no mood for trifling or games, not today. 
TROI: I know what an important day this is for you, the anniversary of
your Rite of Ascension. 
WORF: You know about that? 
TROI: All your friends on board do. 
WORF: That is impossible. It is a secret known only to Klingons. 
TROI: And certain resourceful young Ensigns. 
WORF: Wesley Crusher. What does he know about it? 
TROI: Just bear with me. 
WORF: Where are we going? 
TROI: The holodeck. 
WORF: This is truly trying my patience, Counsellor. 
TROI: I think you will approve. 
WORF: You're not coming in? 
TROI: No. 
WORF: Open.

[Holodeck] 
WORF: An Ascension ceremony. 
LAFORGE: Happy anniversary, Worf. 
DATA: Shall we begin? 
WORF: I am ready. 
(He steps between the two lines of warriors) 
WORF: DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH. tIgwIj Sa'angNIS. 'Iw bIQtIqDaq jIjaH.
Today I am a Warrior. I must show you my heart. I travel the river of
blood. 
(The first two warriors apply their painstiks to his sides, and he
screams in pain) 
DATA: The true test of Klingon strength is to admit one's most profound
feelings while under extreme duress. 
WORF: jIbechrup may' vIlos. 
(The second pair apply their painstiks) 
WORF: The battle is mine. I crave only the blood of the enemy.
HIHIvqa'. 
(Third pair. He falls to his knees and O'Brien holds Pulaski back) 
WORF: The bile of the vanquished flows over my hands. May'pequ' moH. 
(The fourth and final pair use their painstiks twice and he collapses
in front of his 'family') 
WORF: Thank you.

[Observation lounge]

TROI: Is Lieutenant Worf all right? 
PULASKI: He's never been happier. 
TROI: So it was a good ceremony? 
PULASKI: Let's just say that I was not about to stay for refreshments. 
TROI: Klingon culture is not in your taste? 
PULASKI: I'm just glad that humans have progressed beyond the need for
barbaric display. 
TROI: Have they? Commander Riker and his father are in the gymnasium,
about to engage in barbarism of their own. 
PULASKI: Don't remind me. It's something of which I do not approve. 
TROI: In spite of human evolution, there are still some traits that are
endemic to gender. 
PULASKI: You think that they're going to knock each other's brains out
because they're men? 
TROI: Human males are unique. Fathers continue to regard their sons as
children, even into adulthood. And sons continue to chafe against what
they perceive as their fathers' expectations of them. 
PULASKI: It's almost as if they never really grow up at all, isn't it? 
TROI: Perhaps that's part of their charm, and why we find them so
attractive. 
PULASKI: Particularly men like Commander Riker. 
TROI: And his father. 
PULASKI: I hope they don't hurt each other.
