[Ready room]

PICARD: The good news. 
DATA: The motion of the dust has created a great deal of electrostatic
energy in the upper atmosphere. With a modified phaser blast, we could
create a shock front that would encircle the planet and ionise the
particles. 
PICARD: That would be like striking a spark in a gas-filled room. 
DATA: With one exception, sir. The particles would be converted into a
high energy plasma which our shields could absorb and then re-direct
harmlessly into space. 
PICARD: Turn the Enterprise into a lightning rod? 
DATA: Precisely, sir. 
PICARD: And the bad news? 
DATA: If our phaser discharge is off by as little as point zero six
terawatts, it would cause a cascading exothermal inversion. 
PICARD: Meaning? 
DATA: We would completely burn off the planet's atmosphere.

Captain's log, supplemental. While Doctor Moseley
takes La Forge's plan to the leaders of the colony, I find myself
weighing the potential consequences of a more philosophical issue.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Rasmussen enters) 
PICARD: I imagine you know why I've asked you here. 
RASMUSSEN: Yeah, I have a fairly good idea. 
PICARD: I'm faced with a dilemma. There is a planet beneath us which is
slowly turning to ice, and unless we do something about it, I'm told
that in a matter of weeks thousands, maybe tens of thousands, will die.

RASMUSSEN: That'd be a shame. 
PICARD: Yes, it would. It would be quite a shame. 
RASMUSSEN: So, what's your dilemma? 
PICARD: Commander La Forge has a possible solution. The margins of
error are extremely critical, but if successful, there'll be no more
threat. 
RASMUSSEN: And if it's not successful? 
PICARD: Every living thing on the planet will perish. 
RASMUSSEN: So do nothing and thousands will die. Do something and
millions could die. That's a tough choice. 
PICARD: Not if you were to help me. 
RASMUSSEN: You're not suggesting I tell you the outcome of your
efforts? 
PICARD: Oh no, I'm not. Everything that Starfleet stands for,
everything that I have ever believed in, tells me I cannot ask you
that.
But at the same time, there are twenty million lives down there, and
you know what happened to them. What will happen to them. 
RASMUSSEN: So, it seems you have another dilemma. One that questions
your convictions. 
PICARD: Well, I've never been afraid of reevaluating my convictions,
Professor, and now, I have twenty million reasons to do so. 
RASMUSSEN: And why did you ask to see me? 
PICARD: Because your presence gives me potential access to a kind of
information that I've never had available to me before, and if I am to
re-examine my beliefs, then I must take advantage of every possible
asset. It would be irresponsible of me not to ask you here. 
RASMUSSEN: However you come to terms with your beliefs, Captain, I must
tell you that I'm quite comfortable with mine. 
PICARD: How can you be? How can you be comfortable watching people die?

RASMUSSEN: Let me put it to you this way. If I were to tell you that
none of those people died, you'd easily conclude that you tried your
solution and it succeeded. So, you'd confidently try again. No harm in
that. But what if I were to tell you they all died? What then?
Obviously, you'd decide not to make the same mistake twice. Now, what
if one of those people grew up 
PICARD: Yes, Professor, I know. What if one of those lives I save down
there is a child who grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler or Khan
Singh? Every first year philosophy student have been asked that
question ever since the earliest wormholes were discovered. But this is
not a class in temporal logic. It's not theoretical, it's not
hypothetical, it's real. Surely you see that? 
RASMUSSEN: I see it all too well. But you must see that if I were to
influence you, everything in this sector, in this quadrant of the
galaxy could change. History, my history, would unfold in a way other
than it already has. Now what possible incentive could anyone offer me
to allow that to happen? 
PICARD: I have two choices. Either way, one version of history or
another will wend its way forward. The history you know or another one.
Now who is to say which is better? What I do know is here, today, one
way, millions of lives could be saved. Now
isn't that incentive enough? 
RASMUSSEN: Everyone dies, Captain. It's just a question of when. All of
those people down there died years before I was born. All of you up
here, as well. So you see, I can't get quite as worked up as you over
the fate of some colonists who, for me, have been dead a very, very
long time. 
PICARD: Of course, you know of the Prime Directive, which tells us that
we have no right to interfere with the natural evolution of alien
worlds. Now I have sworn to uphold it, but nevertheless I have
disregarded that directive on more than one occasion because I thought
it was the right thing to do. Now, if you are holding on to some
temporal equivalent of that directive, then isn't it
possible that you have an occasion here to make an exception, to help
me to choose, because it's the right thing to do? 
RASMUSSEN: We're not just talking about a choice. It sounds to me like
you're trying to manipulate the future. 
PICARD: Every choice we make allows us to manipulate the future. Do I
ask Adrienne or Suzanne to the spring dance? Do I take my holiday on
Corsica or on Risa? A person's life, their future, hinges on each of a
thousand choices. Living is making choices. Now you ask me to believe
that if I make a choice other than the one found in your history books,
then your past will be irrevocably altered. Well, you know, Professor,
perhaps I don't give a damn about your past, because your past is my
future and as far as I'm concerned, it hasn't been written yet. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, the electrostatic conditions are about as good as
they're going to get. If we're going to try this, now's the time. 
RASMUSSEN: Please don't ask me, Captain. I can't help you. I'm sorry.
