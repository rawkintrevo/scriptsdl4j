[Engineering]

LAFORGE: (to a crewwoman) As soon as we input this
atmospheric data from Moseley, the computer should tell us how many
holes we'll have to
punch. 
DATA: What have you learned about the tectonic stability around the
drilling sites? 
LAFORGE: Couldn't be better. Our scans were all clear and Moseley says
there hasn't been so much as a quiver down there in well over a
century. 
RASMUSSEN: Ah ha, just the two I'm looking for. I've brought you the
forms I need you to complete. Shouldn't take any more than a couple of
hours. 
LAFORGE: We're kind of busy here, Professor. Tomorrow would probably be
better. Data, we've got about twenty three thousand thermal
simulations. You think you could check them through for anomalies? 
DATA: Certainly. 
(Data starts working at the console at fast-forward speed)

RASMUSSEN: Is that as fast as he can go? 
LAFORGE: Not fast enough for you, Professor? 
RASMUSSEN: There's little known about Data's efficiency. Almost nothing
about his part in this mission. It's a topic of great conjecture. 
DATA: Two hundred nine anomalies all within acceptable parameters. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data. You're here to witness this mission. That's it,
isn't it? 
RASMUSSEN: It'd be best if you just thought of me as a fly on the wall,
and went about your business. 
DATA: I will have your answered questions as soon as possible,
Professor. 
RASMUSSEN: Data at Penthara Four! 
LAFORGE: If you'll excuse me. 
RASMUSSEN: Your prosthesis. What do you call it again? 
LAFORGE: A visor. 
RASMUSSEN: Visor. Right. A visor. You know, I have a picture of you
wearing that in my
office. How do you like it? 
LAFORGE: It allows me to see. I like it just fine. 
RASMUSSEN: You know, Homer was blind and Milton. Bach, Monet, Wonder. 
LAFORGE: A fly on the wall, huh? 
RASMUSSEN: A fly on the wall. 
DATA: The computer has configured the drilling pattern and specified
depths. 
LAFORGE: Captain, we've got everything we need. I'm ready to transport
down to the surface. 
PICARD [OC]: I'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good luck, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: Gentlemen. 
(Geordi leaves and Rasmussen pockets a PADD) 
RASMUSSEN: Who said these moments were any less exciting when you know
the outcome? 
DATA: I know of no one who said that, Professor.

[Penthara Science lab]

LAFORGE: The Enterprise will monitor the CO2
concentrations at six different altitudes. If all goes well, it
shouldn't take more than twenty bore sites. 
MOSELEY: Let's hope all goes well. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Commander Riker. How are you doing? 
RIKER: We've gotten word from the monitoring stations. They're all
online. We're ready when you are, Geordi. 
LAFORGE: That's excellent. All we need now is an open channel to Data. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Open a channel, Mister Worf, and prepare to
fire at target one. 
WORF: The computer has locked in phaser depth calculations. 
RIKER: Mister Data? 
DATA [OC]: Ready, sir. 
RIKER: Fire.
