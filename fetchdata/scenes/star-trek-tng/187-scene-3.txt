RIKER: We've received an emergency transmission
from the science station on Ventax Two, sir.

CLARK [on viewscreen]: I am Doctor Howard Clark, director of the
science station here on Ventax Two. Thank you for responding. 
PICARD: Worf, can you improve our reception? 
WORF: The trouble is at the transmission source, sir. 
PICARD: Doctor Clark, we are barely able maintain communication with
you. Can you boost the level of your power source? 
CLARK [on viewscreen]: I'm afraid not, Captain. It's under attack. 
PICARD: Under attack? 
CLARK [on viewscreen]: There's a mob outside the door, trying to break
into the station. The planet is in chaos. Lootings, fires, mass
hysteria. These people are all convinced their world is coming to an
end. Tomorrow. Please, we must have your immediate 
Captain's log, stardate 44474.5. We have reached
Ventax Two and are attempting to contact the Federation science
station, which at last report was under siege by an angry mob.
