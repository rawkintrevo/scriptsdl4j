[Bridge]

CHIEF [OC]: I'm losing them. 
PICARD: Bring them back. Now. Chief Herbert, what's going on? 
[Transporter room]

CHIEF: There seems to be some kind of strange
bouncing effect. 
[Bridge]

CHIEF [OC]: I can't get them to materialise. My
readings aren't complete. 
PICARD: Keep trying. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and Data materialise, Worf a few seconds
later) 
RIKER: What are we doing back here? 
CHIEF: You're lucky you made it back at all, sir. 
[Sickbay]

MANHEIM: Where am I? 
JENICE: Paul. Thank God. You're on the USS Enterprise. They answered
your distress signal. 
MANHEIM: I sent one.? 
JENICE: Oh, Paul, you're going to be just fine. 
MANHEIM: I am not fine, Jenice. I'm not even close to fine. 
CRUSHER: Bridge, this is Doctor Crusher. Professor Manheim is
conscious. 
MANHEIM: Remember, it was worth it, what happened. What will happen,
all of it, it was all worth it. Again. It's changing again. 
CRUSHER: What is? What do you see? 
MANHEIM: I'm having difficulty. 
CRUSHER: With what? Are you in pain? 
MANHEIM: I have been on the other side. I have touched another
dimension. Part of me is still there. 
JENICE: Help him. 
CRUSHER: Try to stay calm, Doctor Manheim. I don't think it's going to
help you struggling against it. 
MANHEIM: My mind is floating between two places. It is difficult to
know which is which. There is no way to explain it. 
(Picard, Data and Troi enter) 
PICARD: Doctor Manheim, I'm Captain Picard. 
MANHEIM: The same one? (Jenice nods) She has told me about you. Not
all, but enough. 
PICARD: We need your help. The situation is not good. 
MANHEIM: It will get worse. 
PICARD: What do we do? How do we stop it? 
MANHEIM: I'm having difficulty holding the moment. 
PICARD: Doctor, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Will you explain the
situation to him? 
DATA: I am fully versed, sir, on all your theories regarding time and
gravity. 
MANHEIM: How is that possible? I am not even fully versed on all of my
theories. 
DATA: I am an android. 
MANHEIM: Android? On a Starfleet vessel? 
DATA: I am the only one, sir. 
MANHEIM: Your knowledge is useless, because the work we have done here
has made most of those theories obsolete. 
DATA: Then you have harnessed a dynamic energy source. 
MANHEIM: Then you do understand. Yes. We were able to locate an energy
source in the centre of this planetoid. We learned to enhance it, to
focus it. Everything worked too well. The energy from the pulsar, the
energy from the planetoid. We opened a crack, a window into another
dimension. 
PICARD: The time distortion we felt. 
MANHEIM: Felt? Then it is not confined to the planetoid? 
DATA: The range is at least several thousand light years. 
MANHEIM: Captain, it must be stopped! You must help me to execute a
controlled shut down of this experiment. Get my notes, they're in the
lab. 
PICARD: How do we bypass the security system? 
MANHEIM: I'll give you the correct coordinates to beam safely down to
Vandor, and the codes you need to bypass security systems to get into
my lab. 
[Observation lounge]

DATA: If what the Professor has given me is
accurate, it is possible to repair the damage. But it must be perfectly
timed to coincide with another time distortion episode.
RIKER: Can we predict the timing? 
DATA: I believe so, sir. 
PICARD: We have to. If we don't seal that hole, this other dimension
he's opened will rip into the fabric of the galaxy. Reality as we
perceive it will not be the same. Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Yes, sir? 
PICARD: I want those codes that Manheim gave Mister Data rechecked and
then checked again. No one is beaming down to Vandor unless we can be
reasonably sure they can get through. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
(The door opens) 
JENICE: I'm sorry for intruding. I was told I'd find you here. 
PICARD: You're not intruding. We're just finished. Come in. Thank you. 
(Riker, Data and Worf leave) 
JENICE: I knew you wouldn't come to me. 
PICARD: No, not under these circumstances. 
JENICE: We have unfinished business. 
PICARD: Yes, we do. 
JENICE: Why didn't you come to meet me that last day in Paris? 
PICARD: I was afraid. 
JENICE: Oh, I didn't want this. 
PICARD: What? 
JENICE: The truth. 
PICARD: Oh, you want me to lie? 
JENICE: Of course. A nice, soft, painless lie. 
PICARD: Oh, I got the days confused. I thought it was Tuesday when it
was Wednesday. I went to the Cafe Moulin instead of the Cafe des
Artistes. 
JENICE: Ah, that's better. It was raining and you couldn't find a cab.
I waited all day. And it was raining. It rained the rest of the week. I
went to Starfleet headquarters looking for you, but you'd already
shipped out. So, come on, Jean-Luc. Let's hear the truth. 
PICARD: It was fear. Fear of seeing you, losing my resolve. Fear of
staying, losing myself. Fear that neither of these choices was right,
and that, and that either would have 
JENICE: For a long time, not a day went by when I didn't look up into
the sky, and wonder. 
PICARD: Each time that I returned to Earth, my thoughts were filled
with you. 
JENICE: I've thought a lot about this over the years, and perhaps
you're leaving out your greatest fear. The real reason you left. 
PICARD: Which was? 
JENICE: That life with me would have somehow made you ordinary. 
PICARD: You're wonderful. And am I that transparent? 
JENICE: Only to me.
