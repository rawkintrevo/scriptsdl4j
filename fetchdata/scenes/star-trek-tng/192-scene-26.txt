RIKER WORF PICARD CRUSHER DATA HEDRICK

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: The skin develops mimetic capabilities. He
may still be on board, but undetectable to our sensors.

[Holodeck - Tarchannen]

(Worf, Riker and two security guards enter) 
WORF: You search the structure. I will take the perimeter. 
(Worf walks around the buildings and comes back with a uniform) 
WORF: Commander. 
RIKER: Geordi's uniform.

[Transporter room]

(the door opens, and a transparent blur rushes in) 
HEDRICK: Security. We have an intruder in transporter room six. Argh. 
(the blur operates the controls)

[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, the security lockout on Transporter
room six has been broken. 
PICARD: Re-engage now. 
DATA: I cannot, sir. The transporter cycle has already begun.

Captain's log, stardate 44668.1. Doctor Crusher's
research indicates that we have less than an hour before Commander La
Forge's transformation becomes irreversible. However, all attempts to
locate him on the surface have failed. 
[Bridge]

WORF: I do not read any life signs on the surface. 
PICARD: Our sensor array is useless. We must find some other way of
locating him. 
DATA: Captain, if we can get close enough to Geordi, we can read his
absorption spectrum with an ultraviolet light. 
RIKER: Can you modify an emergency beacon to operate on UV? 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Make it so. Number One, as soon as Data is ready, I want you to
lead an away team. 
RIKER: Aye, sir.
