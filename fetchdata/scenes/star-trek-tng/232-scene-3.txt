[Amanda's quarters]

AMANDA: Is this for me? 
RIKER: It's all yours. 
AMANDA: It's so big. 
RIKER: For honour students, only the best. 
AMANDA: Well, I could've brought my zoo. 
RIKER: Your zoo? 
AMANDA: That's just what my parents call it. Three dogs isn't that
many, is it? 
RIKER: It depends how they get along. 
AMANDA: I could have a dozen. Mother said enough is enough. I'm sure
going to miss 'em. 
RIKER: We'll keep you so busy you won't have a chance to. I've got to
get going. I have to get back to cargo bay two. 
AMANDA: Well, thanks for walking me down. 
RIKER: Sure. 
(Riker leaves) 
AMANDA: Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. I didn't mean it. 
(I count ten puppies) 
AMANDA: You guys can't stay here. (some vanish) Come on, all of you. 
(she picks up the last two) 
AMANDA: Hello. Come here, little one. You too. Come on, come on. 
(she puts them down and they vanish)

[Medical lab]

(Beverly is demonstrating a tricorder by using it
on Amanda) 
CRUSHER: See all these readouts? That's your heart rate, your blood
pressure all your vital signs. You're in good shape. You might just
live to be my age. 
CRUSHER: Now, all these tricorders need to be tested before they get
put in the supply containers that we're taking to Tagra. 
AMANDA: So I should scan myself with each one to make sure all the
readouts are working? 
CRUSHER: Any unit that doesn't, put it aside and we'll do a diagnostic
on it later. 
AMANDA: Okay. 
CRUSHER: I hear you've been accepted to the Academy. I have a son
there. 
AMANDA: Oh. Being posted on the Enterprise, I guess you don't get to
see him very often? 
CRUSHER: No, not as often as I'd like. 
AMANDA: Do you have any other children? 
CRUSHER: My husband died a number of years ago. Wes was our only child.

AMANDA: Was he old enough to know his father? 
CRUSHER: Jack died when he was five. 
AMANDA: My parents died when I was a baby too. I don't remember
anything about them. Sometimes I wonder what they were like. 
CRUSHER: Your adoptive parents are in Starfleet, aren't they? 
AMANDA: Yeah, they're marine biologists. They've just been posted to
the Bilaren system. 
MEDIC [OC]: Sickbay to Doctor Crusher. You wanted to be told when the
cultures were ready. 
CRUSHER: On my way. When you've finished with the tricorders, Nurse
Ogawa can help you take them down to shuttlebay for loading. 
AMANDA: Okay.
