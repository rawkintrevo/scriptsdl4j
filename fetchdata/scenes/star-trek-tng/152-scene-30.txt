RIKER NURIA TROI LIKO FENTO DATA OJI

[Outside the hall]

OJI: Riker? 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and prepare to beam us directly to
Sickbay, but hang on for my signal. 
DATA [OC]: Acknowledged, Commander. 
OJI: Riker, stop!

[Path]

(The adults hear her calling) 
NURIA: Oji? 
OJI [OC]: It's Riker, he's taking Palmer! 
NURIA: Hali. Yuri, don't let her escape.
(Riker rounds a rock outcrop out of line of Hali's bow, and hides) 
RIKER: I'm clear. Energise!

[Sickbay]

RIKER: Data, has Counsellor Troi beamed up? 
DATA [OC]: Negative, Commander. Sensors show she's in the midst of a
group of Mintakans. 
RIKER: Damn.

[Assembly hall]

(Fento is untied) 
NURIA: He is all right. Hali, find Riker and Palmer. 
LIKO: Why did you and Riker take Palmer from us? 
TROI: We did not take Palmer.

[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: We set him free. Riker and I do not
believe in these fables about an Overseer. 
LIKO [OC]: Don't you realise what you've done? You've angered the
Picard and we may all suffer for it. I know. I've seen him. He is
all-powerful. 
[Assembly hall]

LIKO: Fanto, weren't there stories about the
Overseer destroying those who offended him? 
FENTO: Stories, nothing more. 
NURIA: Liko, we'll get Palmer back. Riker was carrying him. They can't
have gone far. 
LIKO: Still, the Picard may blame us for letting Palmer escape. Perhaps
we should punish her. Let the Overseer know 
[Bridge]

LIKO [OC]: That she and Riker acted alone. 
[Assembly hall]

NURIA: We will keep Troi captive. 
LIKO: That's not enough. 
NURIA: You would have us harm her? 
LIKO: If it will hold off the Picard's anger, yes. I've seen how
powerful he is. 
NURIA: I am unwilling to hurt her needlessly. We will wait for Hali to
return. 
OJI: And if they don't find Palmer? 
NURIA: Then we may have to do as Liko suggests.
