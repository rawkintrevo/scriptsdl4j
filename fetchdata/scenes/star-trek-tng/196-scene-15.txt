[Corridor]

LWAXANA: But Jean-Luc will find a way to settle
this. He always does. 
TIMICIN: No, my decision will only lead to more distrust of other
worlds. Nothing will change. 
LWAXANA: Now don't be foolish. 
TIMICIN: I am not being foolish! Lwaxana, I want to live because I see
in you how much I have to live for. You make me realise that my life
still has value. I can be an example to my people. I can finish my
work. But discovering these new desires and not being able to do
anything about them, not being able to finish my work, not being able
to reach my people. 
LWAXANA: You have made a statement about the sanctity of life, and it
will be heard, Timicin. 
TIMICIN: Who will hear it from light years away? Where will I go now,
Lwaxana? I'm a man without a world. I can't go home. 
LWAXANA: Timicin. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Doctor Timicin. You have a visitor coming aboard.

TIMICIN: B'Tardat?

[Bridge]

RIKER: No, sir. It's your daughter.

[Timicin's quarters]

TIMICIN: Dara. 
(everyone say hi to Michelle Forbes) 
GUEST1: Father. 
TIMICIN: This is Lwaxana Troi. She has been a host and a friend. 
LWAXANA: I've been looking forward to meeting you, Dara. 
TIMICIN: Whatever you have to say to me, can be said in front of her. 
GUEST1: I see. Father, come home. This is wrong. 
TIMICIN: Dara, if I could show you the work I have begun. There's still
so much for me to do. 
GUEST1: There's nothing for me to look at. It is irrelevant. 
LWAXANA: Your father's work may save your world, my dear. I would
hardly consider that irrelevant. 
GUEST1: All I'm concerned with now is you, not your work. Your work is
over. It is your time to rest. 
LWAXANA: Perhaps you will feel differently as you get a little older,
say approaching sixty. 
GUEST1: My father taught me to cherish The Resolution. I don't know how
you have poisoned him to reject it. 
LWAXANA: It's an obscene ritual. 
GUEST1: How dare you. How dare you criticize my way of life, my beliefs. 
TIMICIN: Please. Please, Dara. Please. 
GUEST1: Where will you go? 
TIMICIN: I don't know. 
GUEST1: And where will you die? I cannot bear the thought of you being
laid to rest on some other world. That you will not lie beside my
mother. That I will not be able to lie beside you when my Resolution
comes. I'm sorry. I don't know how you can go on with your life knowing
that each day you live is an insult to everything we believe in.
Father, I love you. But I am ashamed. 
(Dara leaves) 
TIMICIN: I would like to be alone now, please.
