TIMICIN PICARD DATA LAFORGE WORF

[Bridge]

PICARD: Very well. Mister Worf? 
WORF: Photon torpedoes armed and targeted. 
PICARD: Fire in sequence. 
WORF: First volley released. 
DATA: Tracking torpedoes. Entry programme confirmed. 
WORF: Second volley released. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Torpedoes now entering the stellar core. 
TIMICIN: Their shields are holding. Guidance systems normal. 
LAFORGE: Ignition sequence, six seconds 
[Bridge]

LAFORGE [OC]: Five seconds. Four. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Three seconds. Now. Shock wave patterns
within predicted range. Seventeen hundred percent rise in gamma
radiation levels. Helium
fusion rate increasing. 
TIMICIN: What about heat and pressure levels? 
LAFORGE: Steady so far. Density at eleven hundred grams per cubic
centimetre. Temperature approaching sixty million degrees Kelvin. 
TIMICIN: We want it to stabilise at two hundred and twenty million.

[Bridge]

DATA: Pressure wave harmonics dispersing.
Temperature in target zone increasing to eighty one million degrees,
sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Still rising.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Temperature at ninety million degrees
Kelvin. And now one hundred ten million. Looking good.
One hundred thirty seven.
