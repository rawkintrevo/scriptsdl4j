RIKER WORF PICARD TROI WESLEY DATA

[Bridge]

WORF: I get no further response from the vessel. 
PICARD: Maintain an open channel. 
RIKER: Doctor Crusher and her assistants are waiting in Transporter
room three. 
DATA: Sir, may I remind you that during the Galen border conflict, it
was a common tactic of the Talarians was to abandon their observation
craft, rig them to self destruct 
PICARD: And issue a general distress call. Yes, Mister Data, I know. 
DATA: That particular guerrilla manoeuvre resulted in two hundred and
nineteen fatalities over a three day period. 
RIKER: Is there any way to detect their self-destruct device? 
DATA: Negative, sir. The Talarians employ a subspace proximity
detonator. It is not detectable by our scans. 
RIKER: Or the away team's tricorders. Right. 
WORF: Captain, the Talarian warship the Q'Maire is responding to the
distress call. 
PICARD: Position? 
WORF: Halfway through the Woden sector. 
WESLEY: It'll take them hours to get here, sir, even at maximum warp. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: There is life on board, but it's fading. 
PICARD: Number One, assemble the rest of your away team. Prepare for
immediate rescue operations. 
RIKER: Yes, sir.
