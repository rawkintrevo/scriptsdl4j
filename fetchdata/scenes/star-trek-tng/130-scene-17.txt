[Ready room]

OKONA: Captain, you can't be afraid of those two or
what they can do to your ship. 
PICARD: No, they could fire until their lasers ran dry and they
wouldn't hurt the Enterprise. My predicament is what to do with you.
OKONA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry my ship broke down. I'm sorry you stopped
to help. I'm sorry you're involved. But you're right. Whatever happens,
however it goes, someone gets hurt. Hand me over to Kushell, and Debin
goes to war. 
PICARD: And if I hand you over to Debin, then it's the same thing. 
OKONA: I wish I could. I wish I could make it easier. 
PICARD: I'm sure you do. 
OKONA: I'm not going to apologise for the way I am or how I live my
life, but just for the record, I did not steal the Jewel of Thesia. I
am not a criminal, Captain. And as to the other business, that's
between me and Yanar, no one else. 
PICARD: In truth, I simply do not have authority in this matter. I'm
not your judge, nor is it my duty to arbitrate. But you are in my
custody, and that creates the dilemma. 
OKONA: How about this? Do what you said. Fix my guidance system and let
me leave. 
PICARD: According to Starfleet regulations, that would be my only
course of action. But their ships are faster than yours. I'm not doing
you a favour. 
OKONA: Captain, with all due respect, that's not your concern. Besides,
I can take care of myself. 
[Engineering]

OKONA: You're quite a craftsman, Lieutenant La
Forge. How soon? 
LAFORGE: What's the rush? I thought you liked it here. 
OKONA: I did. It stopped liking me. Time to disappear. 
WESLEY: Where will you go? 
OKONA: What? 
WESLEY: I said, where will you go? 
OKONA: A new place, if I make it. 
WESLEY: Don't you ever stay anywhere? 
OKONA: Not for long. 
WESLEY: I couldn't be like that. 
OKONA: Oh? 
WESLEY: I mean, always being alone. Commander Riker says you choose to
live the way you do and you like it. 
OKONA: Is that what he says? 
WESLEY: Yeah. It would be difficult for me to be leaving all the time.
I'd miss my friends, the people I love. I guess leaving's gotten easy
for you. 
OKONA: I seem to have a way of using up a place. 
WESLEY: I wasn't talking about a place. 
OKONA: I know. I know what you were talking about.
LAFORGE: It's ready. You should be able to install this in roughly five
minutes. 
OKONA: Like you said, Geordi, what's the rush? I have some friends
around here. I think it's time to make a stand.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Okona. 
OKONA: Captain, I've decided not to leave. 
PICARD: Oh. 
OKONA: Don't worry, I'm not staying either. 
PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? 
OKONA: I've decided to surrender myself. 
RIKER: To which one? 
OKONA: There's really only one option. 
PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is very
distracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and we
resolve this face to face. 
KUSHELL [on viewscreen]: Excellent. 
DEBIN [on viewscreen]: Agreed. 
RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would you
accompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests.

WORF: Aye, sir.
