DATA: It is fortunate we were able to coordinate
your return on the Teldarian cruiser. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, when I heard the Enterprise had been ordered to the
Krios system, I thought I might be forced to endure another couple of
weeks on Risa. 
DATA: I am sorry to hear you did not enjoy yourself. 
LAFORGE: I was joking. 
DATA: Joking? Ah. Forced to endure Risa. Your actual intent was to
emphasise that you did enjoy yourself. Yes, I see how that could be
considered quite amusing. 
LAFORGE: I missed you, Data.

PICARD: Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Permission to come aboard, sir. 
PICARD: Granted. Welcome back. 
LAFORGE: Thank you, sir. 
PICARD: Commander La Forge is my Chief Engineer. 
KELL: Commander. 
PICARD: He's has been attending a seminar on artificial intelligence on
Risa. 
RIKER: I'm glad we got you back, Geordi. We're going to need your help
on this. 
LAFORGE: Data tells me that the Federation has been accused of aiding
Kriosian rebels. 
PICARD: We're to be presented with evidence today. We'll need your help
in analysing it. 
LAFORGE: Anything I can do. 
(walking to the turbolift) 
TROI: You had a good time. 
LAFORGE: Does it show? 
TROI: You're more relaxed than I've ever seen you. 
(Geordi and Troi enter the turbolift) 
WORF: Captain, Governor Vagh has signalled he is ready to meet with
you. 
PICARD: Very well. Advise him that we will transport sown to the
surface immediately. Ambassador. 
(Picard and Kell leave) 
DATA: Commander Riker. 
RIKER: What is it, Data? 
DATA: Our sensors have detected a brief energy fluctuation in the
E-band. 
RIKER: E-band? That's unusual. What's the source? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. E-band emissions are difficult to localise. 
RIKER: Collapsing protostars sometimes emit E-band bursts. 
DATA: Yes, sir. However, there are no protostars in this sector. 
RIKER: You'd better run a complete scan. Keep me posted. 
DATA: Yes, sir.

LAFORGE: The Carnelians have actually done the most
work on artificial intelligence, so I spent a lot of time in their
research seminars. 
TROI: Geordi, I get the feeling that something special happened on this
vacation, and I'm not talking about computers. 
LAFORGE: Well, I did take second place in a chess tournament. 
TROI: Yes. 
LAFORGE: And I swam a lot. I worked on my back stroke. The water is
very calm on Risa. 
TROI: And? 
LAFORGE: And I walked a lot. That's all. Well, I ate enough for twelve
people. The food there is terrific. They've got a chocolate there,
Counsellor, you would love. 
TROI: And that's all?
LAFORGE: Yeah. Well, there was this 
TROI: Yes? 
LAFORGE: Her name is Jonek. But you wouldn't want to hear about that.
Better get ready for duty. Nice talking to you, Counsellor.
