[Turbolift]

WORF: Deck ten. 
TROI: Worf, can I ask you something? Do you regret what happened last
night? 
WORF: No, of course not. 
TROI: Are you sure? Because I don't want anything to jeopardise our
friendship. 
WORF: Deanna, I do not regret being with you. What is wrong? 
TROI: I'm not feeling myself. Maybe it's the inhibitor. I'm so used to
sensing what people are feeling, and now I can't. 
WORF: Perhaps I should talk to Lieutenant Pierce alone. 
TROI: That might be a good idea. 
WORF: I will meet you in your quarters later. 
TROI: I'll be waiting for you. 
(Worf leaves) 
TROI: Deck eight.

TROI: Come in. 
(it's Pierce) 
TROI: Security to Counsellor Troi's quarters. 
SECURITY [OC]: Acknowledged. 
PIERCE: I don't understand. Lieutenant Worf said you wanted to talk to
me about something. 
TROI: Where is he? 
PIERCE: He said he had to go somewhere. 
TROI: Troi to Worf. Computer, where is Lieutenant Worf? 
COMPUTER [OC]: Lieutenant Worf is in Ensign Calloway's quarters. 
(Security arrive) 
CREWWOMAN: Counsellor? 
TROI: Take Lieutenant Pierce to his quarters and hold him there.

against ringing the bell)

(Worf and Calloway are embracing as Troi enters.
Calloway starts laughing, then Worf.) 
TROI: Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! 
(Deanna grabs a convenient phaser and shoots Worf) 
CALLOWAY: He's dead! You killed him! 
TROI: No! No!

PIERCE: You know what you have to do.
