TASHA PICARD TROI TRAVELLER KOSINSKI

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do you have any further advice, Counsellor?

TROI: When you begin the attempt, there will be stress, and it's only
natural the crew's concentration will shift.
TASHA: Plus some genuine fear, Captain. You can't notice what's
happening outside without feeling some of that.
PICARD: All decks, all stations. 
[Various parts of the ship]

PICARD [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. All
decks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attempt
to warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre your
thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the
Traveller. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Think of giving him some of your
strength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: And now, attempt to concentrate completely
on your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on his
well being.

[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Think of him as someone you care
deeply about. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: All decks, all stations. Battle stations. 
[Engineering]

TRAVELLER: I will need Kosinski back on the main
computer.
KOSINSKI: You need me?
TRAVELLER: Yes.
