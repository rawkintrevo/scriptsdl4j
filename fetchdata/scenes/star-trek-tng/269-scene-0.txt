RIKER DATA TROI ERIC

  [Classroom]

(it is clay sculpture class) 
TROI: (to a girl) That's very good. (to a boy) Well, that's very nice. 
ERIC: No, it isn't. I just can't get it right. Do you think the wings
are too big? 
TROI: Not at all. Birds have wings of all sizes, Eric. And you
shouldn't worry about making it look perfect. 
ERIC: But Mrs Narsu said we should try to make our sculptures as
realistic as possible. 
TROI: She's right. It is important that you be able to make the clay
take the shape you want it to have, but you're not supposed to be
concentrating on technique today. I'm here to help you focus on the
feelings you want to convey with your sculpture. For instance, what do
you think about when you see a bird? 
ERIC: Flying? 
TROI: Fine. So, make your sculpture make me think of flying, too. 
(She moves on to the big kid in the class) 
TROI: How's it going, Data? 
DATA: I have finished. 
(it's a perfect PADD) 
DATA: The dimensions are accurate to within one point three percent. 
TROI: I'm sure they are. Data, you obviously don't have a trouble with
realism, but you're here to work on your imagination. Maybe you should
try something a little more abstract. Here. I want you to start a new
piece. I'd like you to sculpt music. 
DATA: Counsellor, music is a collection of acoustic vibrations. How can
I reproduce a sound with clay? 
TROI: Well, think of the effects that sounds have on people, the images
that music brings to your mind, and then give it a form. 
(he quickly forms a treble clef) 
TROI: It's a start. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Data. Please report to the Bridge. 
DATA: Acknowledged, sir. On my way.
