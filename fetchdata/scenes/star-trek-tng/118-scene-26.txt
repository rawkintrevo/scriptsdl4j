ALEXANDRA: I want Mommy. I want Mommy. 
[First Unit]

DUANA: You haven't eaten. 
WESLEY: You didn't eat anything. 
RADUE: We need very little. 
DUANA: I know you miss your family. But you will grow accustomed to us.
I promise you'll be happy. 
WESLEY: We were happy before we came. 
DUANA: We are offering more, especially for you. 
WESLEY: Duana, I feel badly for you that you have no children, but I
have to tell you that we don't want to be here and we will not
cooperate. 
[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: No. That doesn't fit the pattern. Give me
a list of the appropriate medical literature from the twenty-second
century. There's not enough time! 
PICARD: Is there anything I can do? 
CRUSHER: You just did, Jean-Luc. Now I have to get back to work.
