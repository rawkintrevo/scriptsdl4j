FELTON: Captain, we are entering sector nine seven.

DATA: I am picking up massive gravitational fluctuations, sir. 
PICARD: Take us out of warp, Ensign. 
FELTON: Yes, sir. 
WORF: The Black Cluster is within visual range, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF: Aye, Captain. 
(it looks like any other streak of black against a star cluster) 
RIKER: Let's find that ship. Full sensor sweep, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: What a sight. 
PICARD: One of the most ancient formations in the galaxy. 
DATA: I have located the Vico, sir. The vessel appears to be adrift. 
RIKER: Let's see it. Life signs? 
WORF: Nothing, Commander. 
RIKER: Damage report, Mister Data. 
DATA: Outer and inner hulls have been breached. Decks seven through
twelve are exposed to space. 
RIKER: Set up a translink to their computer core. Let's see what
happened. 
DATA: I cannot, sir. The emergency bulkheads on that deck are in place.
Our linkup signal cannot penetrate them. 
PICARD: Structural status, Commander? 
DATA: Stress readings indicate considerable pressure on the transverse
supports. 
PICARD: Is it stable enough for an away team? 
DATA: Yes, sir, but the risk of structural collapse is quite high. 
PICARD: Have transporter room one maintain a lock on each member of
your away team. I want you out of there at the first sign of trouble. 
RIKER: Take us to fifteen thousand metres, Ensign. 
FELTON: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Data, you're with me.
