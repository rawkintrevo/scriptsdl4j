[Transporter room]

RIKER: Unbelievable. 
PICARD [OC]: We're losing the freighter. Got to beam those people over
now. 
RIKER: Clear the cargo. Beam it to a hold. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Freighter Sanction, this is the Enterprise, Get to your
transporter pad and. No, forget about that. Lock on to any life form
you can find and get them over now. 
TASHA: Trying, sir.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: The freighter is going down. 
PICARD: Transporter Room. You're out of time.

[Transporter room]

TASHA: Reading six life forms, but I can't get a
solid lock. 
RIKER: We have no choice. Energise. I thought you said there were six.
Where are the other two? 
TASHA: The lock didn't hold. 
RIKER: Re-establish. 
TASHA: It's too late.

(The freighter goes bang) 
PICARD: Number One?

[Transporter room]

(Two scruffy men, one smart man and a smart woman
arrive) 
RIKER: Two are lost, sir. But we saved four. I'm Commander William
Riker of the USS Enterprise. I'm sorry we were unable to rescue the
other two. We did everything we could. If you had come instead of
sending your cargo, you all would have made it. 
T'JON: The cargo. Where is it? 
ROMAS: You did save it, didn't you? 
(The two men are scruffy, with five o'clock shadow) 
RIKER: Yes, we did. It's in one of our cargo holds. You act like it's
more important than your comrades. 
T'JON: The cargo. May we see it? 
RIKER: Follow me.
