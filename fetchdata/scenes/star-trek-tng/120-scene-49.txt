TASHA: So is Konmel. Korris is loose and armed. 
PICARD: Keep me informed, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, visual on K'Nera. 
DATA: Visual on, sir. 
PICARD: Captain, there will be a short delay. Korris has escaped. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: He is a trained Klingon warrior, Captain.
Perhaps more than you can handle. It is not a disgrace to request our
assistance. 
PICARD: I think we can handle the situation.

(Korris runs in and sees the warp core. He heads up
a ladder. Tasha enters) 
CREWMAN: He's up there! 
TASHA: Captain, Korris is in main Engineering. 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Korris. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: This is a futile effort. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: You cannot win. 
KORRIS: I will speak only to my countryman! 
[Bridge]

KORRIS [OC]: Only to Worf! 
[Engineering]

TASHA: Captain, he has a phaser aimed directly at
the dilithium crystal chamber. 
[Bridge]

TASHA [OC]: At that range, one blast and 
PICARD: I understand, Lieutenant. 
WORF: Captain, permission to leave the Bridge. 
PICARD: We'll both go.

[Engineering]

PICARD: What's the situation? 
TASHA: He's on the second level armed with a phaser. We do not have a
clear field of fire. 
PICARD: How do you suggest we proceed? 
TASHA: Wait him out. 
WORF: Captain, let me talk to him. 
TASHA: I do not think that's a good idea, Worf. Right now he's running
on adrenalin. Let it cool. There's no where he can go. 
WORF: He will wait only as long as he believes it is to his advantage.
The moment it is not, he will fire his phaser into the dilithium
crystal chamber. 
TASHA: That would destroy the Enterprise and him along with it. 
WORF: Yes. He knows. 
PICARD: Talk to him, Worf. 
(Worf goes to under where Korris is standing) 
KORRIS: Brother, I knew you would come. (Worf climbs the ladder) Now I,
we have a chance. I could not do it alone, but I would rather die here,
than let the traitors of Kling pick the meat from my bones. With you it
will work. 
WORF: What will work? 
KORRIS: I will demand Captain Picard give us access to the battle
bridge. We will separate from the rest of the ship, then together we
will light up the galaxy. Imagine the fear which will roll before us. 
WORF: Captain Picard will not comply. 
KORRIS: He can not, dare not refuse us. In order to save themselves,
they will give us what we demand. Then, brother, we are free. 
WORF: Put down the phaser. 
KORRIS: Wait. I do not believe this. 
WORF: Believe it. 
KORRIS: I have tasted your heart. You have been with them, but you are
still of us. Do not deny the challenge of your destiny. Get off your
knees and soar. Open your eyes and let the dream take flight. 
WORF: My brother, it is you who does not see. You look for battles in
the wrong place. The test of the warrior is not without, it is within.
Here, here we meet the challenge. It is the weaknesses in here a
warrior must overcome. 
KORRIS: No. 
WORF: You have talked of glory and of conquest and legends we will
write. 
KORRIS: Yes, the birthright of every Klingon. 
WORF: Yet in all you say, where are the words duty, honour, loyalty.
Without which a warrior is nothing. 
KORRIS: What are you saying? Living among these humans has sucked the
Klingon heart out of you. 
WORF: Put down the phaser. 
KORRIS: You are a sham! My words were dust upon the ground. Your blood
has no fire.
You are weak like them. I don't care what you look like you are no
Klingon. 
WORF: Perhaps not. 
(And he shoots Korris, who falls through a glass screen to the floor
below) 
PICARD: Wait. 
(Worf goes down the ladder, turns Korris over, and does the death
ritual for him)
