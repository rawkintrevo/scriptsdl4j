PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

CRUSHER: [OC]: Sickbay to Bridge, 
PICARD: Picard here. Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: [OC]: I'm confining Lieutenant La Forge to Sickbay until
further notice. 
PICARD: Do we have a problem, Doctor? 
[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: I don't know yet. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Data, I need help in locating some library
computer information. 
DATA: Specifics, sir? 
RIKER: All I have is a vague memory of reading somewhere about someone
taking a shower in his or her clothing. 
DATA: Ah. The body Geordi discovered. 
RIKER: I believe it may have happened before. 
DATA: To someone, somewhere. 
RIKER: This ought to be easy for someone written up in bio-mechanical
texts. 
DATA: About that, sir. Did the Doctor believe I was boasting? 
RIKER: Probably. This may take some time. 
DATA: At least several hours. But what I said was a statement of fact.
Perhaps she will look it up. 
RIKER: You can depend on it.

[Sickbay]

(While Beverly puts the results of her latest scan
into her computer, Geordi takes off his comm. badge and walks out into
the corridor. When she gets there, he is nowhere in sight) 
CRUSHER: Geordi!

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Security. Lieutenant La Forge just left
Sickbay while I was in my office.
