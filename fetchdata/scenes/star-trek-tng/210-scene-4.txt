KYLE WORF ALEXANDER

[Corridor]

WORF: Did you enjoy going to school on Earth? 
ALEXANDER: Yes. 
WORF: Did you like your teachers? 
ALEXANDER: Yes. 
WORF: Good. I understand you lived in my old room. 
ALEXANDER: Ah ha. 
WORF: Good.

[Mrs. Kyle's office]

KYLE: Come in. Lieutenant Worf. Very nice to see
you again. And you must be Alexander. I hear you'll be coming to school
with us for a while? Well, we're very excited to have you with us. I
know the other boys and girls will be happy to have a new classmate.
First I need to get a little information from you. Let's start with
your name. Alexander Rozhenko. That's a tough one. Maybe you can help
me with that. Could you spell your last name for me? 
(but Alexander is too busy looking around the room) 
WORF: Alexander. The teacher asked you a question. 
KYLE: It doesn't matter. I think I can figure it out. Date of birth? 
(Worf doesn't know) 
ALEXANDER: The forty third day of Maktag, stardate 43205. 
WORF: Yes. Yes, of course. 
KYLE: I'll get the rest of his personal records from the school on
Earth, and, oh, one last question. How long will he be staying aboard
ship? 
WORF: It has not been decided.
