PICARD: All stop. Initiate long range scans. 
DATA: Captain, there are four warbirds holding position on the Romulan
side of the Neutral Zone. 
WORF: The Federation Starships Concord and Bozeman are holding position
on our side. 
RIKER: A face off. The question is, who's going to move first? 
PICARD: We are. Mister Worf, hail the Romulan flagship. 
WORF: The warbird Terix is responding. 
PICARD: On screen. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Captain Picard.

[Future - USS Pasteur Bridge]

CRUSHER: Hello, Worf. It's been a long time. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: It is good to see you again. 
CRUSHER: Have you had a chance to read our request? 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Yes. But you must realise I am no longer a member
of the High Council. 
PICARD: But surely, Worf, you must still have some influence. We have
to get into the Neutral Zone. Can't you just get us permission to cross
the border? 
WORF [on viewscreen]: I must refuse. It is for your own safety. The
Neutral Zone is extremely volatile. If Admiral Riker had given you a
starship with a cloak, you would have been safe. It is hard to believe
that even he would refuse to help you. 
PICARD: I don't care what kind of ship we go in. We have to get to the
Devron System. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: I am sorry. My first duty is to the Empire. I
must adhere to regulations. 
PICARD: I know that I'm an old man and I'm out of touch, but the Worf
that I remember was more concerned with things like honour and loyalty
than rules and regulations. But that was a long time ago. Maybe you're
not the Worf once I knew. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Dor sHo GHA! You have always used your knowledge
of Klingon honour and tradition to get what you want from me. 
PICARD: Because it always works, Worf. Your problem is that you really
do have a sense of honour and you really do care about trust and
loyalty. Don't blame me for knowing you so well. 
WORF [on viewscreen]: Very well. You may cross the border. But only if
I come with you. I am familiar with the Neutral Zone. 
PICARD: Terms accepted. 
(transmission ends) 
CRUSHER: Inform transporter room two to beam the Governor aboard. I
must make one thing very clear, Jean-Luc. If we run into any serious
opposition, I'm taking us back into Federation territory. We aren't
well armed and wouldn't last long in a fight. 
CHILTON: Governor Worf is aboard, Captain. 
CRUSHER: All right. Set course for the Devron system, warp thirteen.
(pause) Once more, for old time's sake? 
(Picard sits in the Captain's chair and raises his hand) 
PICARD: Engage.

[Past - Bridge]

O'BRIEN: Engage to where, sir? 
PICARD: Set a course for the Devron system, and engage at warp nine. 
TASHA: The Devron System is inside the Neutral Zone, sir. 
PICARD: I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Carry out my orders, Chief. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
TROI: Captain, may I have a word with you in private? 
PICARD: Yes of course, Counsellor. Contact Farpoint Station. I wish to
speak with Commander Riker. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.
