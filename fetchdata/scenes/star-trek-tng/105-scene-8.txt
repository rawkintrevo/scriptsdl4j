VALEDA PICARD TROI LAFORGE LWAXANA

[Turbolift]

LWAXANA: Of course, the thoughts of Wyatt's father
toward me were almost as vulgar, but he really doesn't have Xelo's 
PICARD: Passenger accommodation. 
LWAXANA: He doesn't really have Xelo's imagination. 
TROI: Mother. 
LWAXANA: Between him and that woman's inane chatter, it's a wonder I
made it here at all. How do you like the Millers, Captain? 
PICARD: I'm sure I find them perfectly pleasant 
LWAXANA: As for me, I find it shocking how they've changed in the years
since my husband and I knew them. Of course, it's probably because I've
grown beyond them. You realise of course that with Betazoids, our
ability to read the thoughts of others does see us grow much faster
than the typical plodding human who 
TROI [OC]: Mother, that's enough! 
LWAXANA [OC]: So, you're not totally out of practice. Good. Very good.

[Lwaxana's quarters]

PICARD: We hope you find the room comfortable. 
LWAXANA: Yes, the room is adequate. Small, but adequate. You will of
course adjust the temperature to a civilised level? 
PICARD: I'll see what I can do. And now, if you will excuse me, I'm
sure the two of you have a lot to talk about. 
LWAXANA: Yes, Captain. You may go. 
(Picard backs out of the room with a bow) 
LWAXANA [OC]: You've been slack, little one. Allowed your mental powers
to rust. 
TROI [OC]: Only to avoid confusion, mother. Humans constantly think one
thing and say another. 
LWAXANA [OC]: Yes, they do, don't they. Poor dears. Our style of
complete honesty frightens them. 
TROI: On that subject Mother, there is such a thing as too much honesty
with humans. 
LWAXANA [OC]: If they'd only say what they think instead of hiding it.
An entire shipload of such inconsistency could drive one insane. 
LWAXANA: Darling, I'm terribly sorry about what happened here. Truly I
am. Steven Miller tracked me down and reminded me of the vows we had
made. 
TROI: Mother, I'm having some trouble believing in those vows as once I
did. 
LWAXANA: Deanna. 
TROI: But I'll honour them, of course. I'm a Betazoid. 
LWAXANA: You may find Wyatt an unusual person. I've sensed remarkable
depths in him.

[Bridge]

LAFORGE: Message coming in from Haven, Captain. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(An elegant woman appears) 
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine of Haven.
Captain Picard? 
PICARD: Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard. 
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Your presence honours us, and your timing is
fortuitous, Captain. 
PICARD: In what way? 
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: An incoming vessel has bypassed our stargate,
violating our law. It has refused any attempt at communication. 
PICARD: Are you saying you believe it to be hostile? 
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Failure to communicate is inherently hostile.
We have no defensive capabilities here and our treaty with the
Federation specifies your obligations in that matter. 
PICARD: Agreed. But let's hope it doesn't become a defence matter. 
VALEDA [on viewscreen]: Of course, Captain, but I'm very happy we have
you here.
