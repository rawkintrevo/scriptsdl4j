  [Ship's
theatre]

(A production of a scene from Cyrano de Bergerac,
with Reginald Barclay in the title role and Beverly Crusher as Roxanne)

CRUSHER: You were like a brother to me. Do you remember? We used played
in the park near the lake. 
BARCLAY: Yes, of course. Every summer, you came to Bergerac. 
CRUSHER: You used to make swords out of the reeds, and when you cut
your hand you would come running to me, and I would say, Let me see.
Oh! How did you do that? 
BARCLAY: Playing near the Porte de Nesle. 
(he catches his hat on the scenery and it comes off) 
CRUSHER: And how many did you plat against? 
BARCLAY: No more than a hundred. 
CRUSHER: Tell me! 
BARCLAY: No. 
CRUSHER: (sotto, prompting) Let it go. 
BARCLAY: (sotto) What? 
CRUSHER: (sotto) Let it go. 
BARCLAY: Let it go. Let it go. You tell me what you were going to say.
Do you dare? 
CRUSHER: I do dare. I love someone. 
BARCLAY: Ah! 
CRUSHER: He does not know. 
BARCLAY: Ah! 
CRUSHER: Not yet. But he is proud, noble, brave and beautiful. 
BARCLAY: Beautiful? 
CRUSHER: What's the matter? 
BARCLAY: With me? Nothing. It is my hand. He is in the Guards? 
CRUSHER: Since this morning. Baron Christien de Neuvillette. In your
own regiment. 
BARCLAY: Ah. 
CRUSHER: Promise me. Promise me to be his friend. 
BARCLAY: I promise. 
CRUSHER: Oh, I love you. I must go now. Oh, and tell him to write me. A
hundred men! What courage! 
BARCLAY: Oh, but I have done better since. 
(polite applause) 
RIKER: Bravo! 
TROI: Wonderful! Wonderful. 
DATA: Lieutenant Barclay's performance was adequate, but clearly not
rooted in The Method approach. I do not understand why. 
RIKER: Data, because it's polite. 
LAFORGE: Good job, Reg. And only what, six weeks of lessons. 
CRUSHER: Good job, period. 
BARCLAY: We have a patient teacher. 
CRUSHER: Ah, Worf, I have an opening in my workshop. 
(Crusher, Riker, Work and La Forge leave) 
TROI: Well done. 
BARCLAY: Thank you, Counsellor. 
TROI: You've come a long way, Reg. 
BARCLAY: After more rehearsals than I can count. 
TROI: I don't just mean your acting ability. It takes a great deal of
courage to put yourself on display like that. 
BARCLAY: You think so? 
TROI: There was a time when nothing could have dragged you onto a stage
in front of an audience. You've made tremendous progress. 
BARCLAY: I, I guess. 
TROI: Don't you think so? 
BARCLAY: Well, I just feel more more comfortable playing somebody else.
Maybe all this is not any better than escaping into a holodeck fantasy.

TROI: I disagree. This isn't fantasy, it's theatre. You used to
withdraw onto the holodeck. You isolated yourself inside your own
imagination, avoiding contact with real people. Look at yourself now.
Look at all the other people you're with. You're not just acting,
you're interacting. Give yourself some credit, Mister Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Maybe you're right.

Federation space. The unmanned structure mysteriously stopped relaying
its data nearly two months ago.
