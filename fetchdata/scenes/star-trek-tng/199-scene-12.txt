[Troi's office]

TROI: I think you should be careful. This isn't
just some experiment you're running, Data. Jenna is a living, breathing
person with needs and feelings that have to be considered. 
DATA: Then you do not believe I should pursue this any further. 
TROI: I didn't say that. I just want you to be aware that this is
unlike any other more casual relationship that you've attempted. 
DATA: I have studied much human literature on the subject of love and
romantic liaisons. There are many role models for me to emulate. 
TROI: Ultimately, Jenna will care for you for what you are, not what
you imitate out of a book. 
DATA: My programming may be inadequate to the task. 
TROI: We're all more than the sum of our parts, Data. You'll have to be
more than the sum of your programming.

WORF: Klingons do not pursue relationships. They
conquer that which they desire. However, Lieutenant D'Sora serves under
my command. If she were mistreated, I would be very displeased, sir. 
DATA: I understand.

[Observation lounge]

RIKER: I think you should pursue it. First of all,
she's a beautiful woman. She seems to be crazy about you. 
DATA: Jenna has clearly demonstrated how she feels about me, but I am
not capable of returning those feelings. 
RIKER: Data, when you get involved with another person, there are
always risks of disappointment, of getting hurt. 
DATA: I cannot be hurt. But she can. 
RIKER: Jenna knows that and she has obviously decided to take the
chance. Data, when it really works between two people, it's not like
anything you've ever experienced. The rewards are far beyond simple
friendship. 
DATA: How far, sir? 
RIKER: That's what I'm hoping you're going to find out. 
DATA: Thank you, Commander.
