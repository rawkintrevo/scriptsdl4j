CRUSHER: (to nurse) Thank you. Deanna, you
understand that if your paracortical readings go too high again, I'm
going to tell Maques to sever the connection. 
TROI: I know.

[Corridor]

TROI: Hedril, be careful. 
(Hedril pets the wolf) 
HEDRIL: Who is Hedril? 
TROI: Wait! I want to talk to you. 
(the corridor ends in open space) 
LWAXANA [OC]: Help me. Help me! 
(Deanna jumps into the void)

[Arboretum]

(although the pond is still, the sound of running
water is very loud. Deanna's reflection turns into that of a blonde
girl) 
LWAXANA [OC]: Go. 
TROI: Mother? 
LWAXANA: Go away. 
TROI: No. I want to help you. Why did you delete parts of your journal?
Did something happen to you you don't want me to know about? 
LWAXANA: Leave me alone, please. 
TROI: Who's Hedril, mother? Why is she here? Is Hedril me when I was a
little girl? 
LWAXANA: No! Oh, no, I'd never let anything happen to you. Never. 
TROI: Did you let something happen to someone? Was it here at El'nar? 
LWAXANA: You were just a baby. 
TROI: Tell me. Whatever it is. we can face it together. 
LWAXANA: I can't. I can't. 
TROI: You can. We can. 
HEDRIL: Help me. Help me, papa. 
(Hedril and Ian are playing with a small dog by the pond, while a baby
is sitting nearby) 
LWAXANA: Please don't make me go through this again. 
IAN: Hold on to him. Don't let him run off. 
HEDRIL: I won't. Mommy, can we go play by the water? 
LWAXANA: No, Kestra, stay here with us. 
HEDRIL: Please? 
(the baby cries) 
LWAXANA: Kestra. Oh, Kestra, you've made the baby cry. 
TROI: Kestra? 
LWAXANA: Don't cry, Deanna. Don't cry, mommy's here. 
HEDRIL: Mommy, please? 
IAN: No, Kestra. We're going to eat in just a few minutes. 
LWAXANA: What's wrong, what's wrong, little one? Tell mommy what's
wrong. Ian, she's teething, Now where's her ring? 
(it goes dark) 
LWAXANA: No, no. I don't want to see this again. I can't. 
TROI: What happened, Mother. What happened next? 
LWAXANA: I don't remember. 
TROI: You have to. You can't hold it back. It's killing you. 
LWAXANA: The dog got away. She ran after him. We didn't notice. 
(lights up, Ian is soaking wet and Lwaxana is distraught) 
(back to the dark) 
LWAXANA: Why? Why did I look away? Why wasn't I paying attention? 
TROI: You have to forgive yourself, Mother. You have to let go. 
LWAXANA: How can I? I let her die. 
TROI: It was a terrible tragedy. The worst thing that can happen to any
parent. I know you feel responsible but it was an accident. And what
you're doing isn't fair to Kestra. 
TROI: I saw a little girl who was sweet and happy. She must have
brought a great deal of joy to your lives. 
LWAXANA: She woke up every morning with a smile. 
TROI: Isn't it better to remember her like that? I just found out I had
a sister I never knew. I'd like to learn what was good and joyous about
her. To celebrate her life, not mourn it. 
LWAXANA: How? How can I do that? 
TROI: Kestra was here a few moments ago. Talk to her. 
LWAXANA: No. No. 
TROI: Do it, mother. Tell her how you feel. I'll be here with you. I'll
help you. 
KESTRA: Mommy. 
LWAXANA: Kestra. Oh, Kestra. My precious one. I'm so sorry. 
(they embrace) 
KESTRA: I have to go now. 
LWAXANA: I know. I know. 
(Kestra vanishes, and Lwaxana takes Deanna's hand)
