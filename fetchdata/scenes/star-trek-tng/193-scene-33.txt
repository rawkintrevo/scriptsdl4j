RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD DATA BARCLAY

[Bridge]

PICARD: Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut
down? 
BARCLAY [OC]: A neural interface was created to expedite the repairs. 
RIKER: Barclay? 
PICARD: Computer, respond. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I am responding, sir. I'm sorry if I caused you any
alarm. It was necessary in order to secure the Array. 
RIKER: Barclay! 
[Holodeck]

RIKER [OC]: Barclay, what's going on? Barclay! 
(blue laser lights fire at Barclay's head as he sits under his holodeck
creation) 
BARCLAY [OC]: Yes, Commander, it's me. 
(after a short break, Picard, Worf, Riker and La Forge have arrived on
the holodeck) 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm sorry, Captain, I was only trying to help. Our
computer was too slow to compensate for the overload on the Array. So I
created an interface that communicated my thoughts directly to the
central processing unit. 
RIKER: Exactly what does that mean? 
BARCLAY [OC]: My body is as you see it here, but much of my higher
brain functions and memory have been transferred to the starboard
computer core. 
PICARD: Mister Barclay, remove yourself from the computer system. Leave
the holodeck. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I'm afraid I can't, sir. 
PICARD: Why not? 
BARCLAY [OC]: My primary cerebral functions are now operating almost
entirely from within the computer. They have expanded to such a degree
that it would be impossible to return to the confines of my human
brain. Any attempt to do so would mean my death.

[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: That's it. I've disconnected the visual
and audio pickups. We can talk without being monitored by the computer.

WORF: By Barclay. 
PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: It is now almost impossible to tell where Barclay ends and the
computer begins. He's actually rewriting the isolinear chips each time
he extends himself a little further. 
RIKER: How do we get him out of there? 
LAFORGE: We don't. Not without killing him. 
PICARD: This is an intolerable situation. I have no wish to harm him,
but I cannot allow Mister Barclay to continue to act
as the computer. I don't care how smart he is. 
DATA: Lieutenant Barclay has not yet extended himself into the
Engineering subsystems. It may be possible to establish an ODN bypass
directly to the Bridge. 
PICARD: That still won't give us control of the ship. 
LAFORGE: No, but it would give us access to the propulsion systems.
Enough to get us to the next Starbase. 
RIKER: How long would it take to set that up? 
LAFORGE: A few hours. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
[Jefferies tube]

BARCLAY [OC]: Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, Reg? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I thought you would be in your quarters. 
LAFORGE: No, I'm just catching up on some work, you know? That level
three diagnostic we talked about. How're you doing? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I wish I could convey to you what it's like for me now.
What I've become. 
LAFORGE: Yeah? Try. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I can conceive almost infinite possibilities, and can
fully explore each of them in a nanosecond. I perceive the universe as
a single equation, and it is so simple, I understand. 
LAFORGE: You understand? 
BARCLAY [OC]: Everything. 
LAFORGE: Well, do you understand how this happened to you? 
BARCLAY [OC]: I believe it is a gift. That I have been chosen to
fulfill a great purpose. 
LAFORGE: Ah ha. 
BARCLAY [OC]: Do you suppose all of this has changed the way people
think about me? 
LAFORGE: To tell you the truth, Reg, we don't know what to think. 
BARCLAY [OC]: I've been concerned about that, but soon everyone will
understand what I can do for humanity. 
LAFORGE: What do you mean? 
[Holodeck]

BARCLAY [OC]: We have always perceived the maximum
speed of the Enterprise as a function of warp, but I know now there are
no limits. We will explore new worlds that we could never before have
reached in our lifetime.
