people's lives. 
CRUSHER: You're using the desperation of an injured man as an excuse to
try a procedure that you couldn't do under normal circumstances. I
checked with Starfleet Medical. They have turned down your request to
test genetronics on humanoids three times already. 
RUSSELL: Are you really going to hide behind the rules of some
bureaucracy? Beverly, your patient's life is at stake here. 
CRUSHER: Look, before you do any of this
