duty worlds disobedient going acts soon willing calmer discuss

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: I'm sorry, there is nothing I can do. His
neural physiology is unusual. I can't wipe his memory. 
PICARD: I see. How is he? 
CRUSHER: As well as can be expected. I've given him a mild sedative and
Troi's been speaking with him. And he seems much calmer. 
PICARD: Does he understand the situation? 
CRUSHER: I think so. 
PICARD: Contact Mister Worf. Make sure he knows what's going on. 
TROI: Here he is now. This is Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Vorin, isn't it? 
VORIN: Why did you bring us here? 
PICARD: Your planet was dying. It could no longer support life. We took
you away from it. 
VORIN: But we never left the caves. 
PICARD: We have the ability to create the illusion of other places,
like the caves on your planet. You have actually spent the last two
days here on this starship, not on Boraal. 
VORIN: Then our home is gone. 
TROI: Yes. 
PICARD: Vorin, listen to me. We can visit many other worlds. We can
take you to one where you can build a new life. 
VORIN: A new life? 
PICARD: A chance for your culture, your people, to survive and grow. 
VORIN: How can we grow when everything that made us who we are is gone?

face) 
NIKOLAI: Dobara, you go on ahead. 
WORF: I will carry your pack. Go and join the others. 
KATERAS: Thank you, seer. 
NIKOLAI: It'll be dark soon, in a few hours. Would you ask Mister La
Forge to create a suitable campsite for us a few kilometres from here?
What's wrong? 
WORF: Vorin has left the holodeck. 
NIKOLAI: How did he get out? 
WORF: I do not know, but Doctor Crusher cannot erase his memory. 
NIKOLAI: What will they do with him? 
WORF: They have explained the situation to him. He must make his own
decisions. 
NIKOLAI: Wait. Are you saying that if Vorin wants to come back in here,
they'll let him? 
WORF: That is right. He is not a prisoner. 
NIKOLAI: But if he comes back here and tells the others what he has
seen on the Enterprise, everything we have done will be for nothing. 
WORF: Then you should have considered that before you beamed them on
board. But you never think about the consequences of your acts. 
NIKOLAI: If you mean by that that I'm willing to do something while
others hesitate, that's true. 
WORF: Wherever you go, you create chaos. How many times did our parents
lie awake at night, wondering what kind of trouble you were in? 
NIKOLAI: Oh, if only I could have been like you. Worf, the perfect son.

WORF: I was not perfect, but I was not wild and disobedient. 
NIKOLAI: Of course not. You were too busy doing your duty. 
WORF: I would rather be accused of that than making our mother weep.
But I see it is clear you have no intention of changing. I see no
reason to discuss it further.

WORF: Commander, the holodeck malfunctions
