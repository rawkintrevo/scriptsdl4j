(mealtime for the newly-weds) 
O'BRIEN: What is it? 
KEIKO: Kelp buds, plankton loaf and sea berries. 
O'BRIEN: Sweetheart, I'm not a fish. 
KEIKO: It's very healthy. I had this every morning when I was growing
up. 
O'BRIEN: What? No muffins or oatmeal, or corned beef and eggs? 
KEIKO: For breakfast? 
O'BRIEN: Keiko, I've been thinking You've been introducing me to all
this wonderful food that you're accustomed to. I'd like to do the same.
Isn't that what marriage is about? Sharing? 
KEIKO: What kind of foods? 
O'BRIEN: Scalloped potatoes, mutton shanks, oxtails and cabbage. 
KEIKO: Kind of heavy. 
O'BRIEN: Oh, you'll love it, I promise. I can still remember the aromas
when my mother was cooking. 
KEIKO: She cooked? 
O'BRIEN: She didn't believe in a replicator. She thought real food was
more nutritious. 
KEIKO: She handled real meat? She touched it and cut it? 
O'BRIEN: Yeah, like a master chef. She was fantastic. Of course, I'll
have to use the replicator, but I'll make something special for you
tonight. You'll love it, I promise. 
KEIKO: Okay. Maybe I'll have something special for you, tonight, too. 
(weapons fire) 
O'BRIEN: Something's wrong. 
COMPUTER: Red alert. Take emergency stations.
