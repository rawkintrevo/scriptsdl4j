(Picard is in bed, asleep. That pillow cum bolster
looks very uncomfortable) 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, I'm sorry to disturb you. 
PICARD: Yes, Number One. What is it? 
RIKER [on monitor]: An incoming message. Code Forty Seven, sir. 
PICARD: Pipe it through. 
COMPUTER: This is an emergency communiqu. It is not to be discussed
with fellow officers unless deemed absolutely necessary. There will be
no computer record of said transmission. 
PICARD: Understood. 
COMPUTER: Proceed with voice print identification. 
PICARD: Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS Enterprise. 
COMPUTER: Voice print verified. 
PICARD: Walker! 
KEEL [on monitor]: Hello, Jean-Luc. It's been a long time. 
PICARD: Too long, old friend. Why are you contacting me on this
frequency? 
KEEL [on monitor]: It was a difficult decision. I felt it was worth the
risk. 
PICARD: Risk? 
KEEL [on monitor]: It's about Starfleet. About something we've always
considered to be impossible. 
PICARD: I don't understand. 
KEEL [on monitor]: I can't explain it now. We need to talk, face to
face. 
PICARD: You're using a Code Forty Seven. I have to know what this is
all about. 
KEEL [on monitor]: Not over subspace, no. 
PICARD: Oh, for God's sake, Walker. This is a secured channel 
KEEL [on monitor]: No. I want you to meet me on Dytallix B. 
PICARD: When? 
KEEL [on monitor]: Immediately. 
PICARD: Not possible. We're expected at Pacifica, 
KEEL [on monitor]: That can wait. You owe me. And you owe it to
yourself to hear what I have to say. Something is beginning. Don't
trust anyone. Remember that, Jean-Luc. Don't take anything for granted.

PICARD: Walker. 
KEEL [on monitor]: Dytallix B. We'll be waiting.
