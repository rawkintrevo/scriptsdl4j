LAFORGE: But to get a point zero zero four
variance, we'd need an incredibly sensitive phase discriminator, Data.
I don't think we've got one that would come close. 
DATA [OC]: Yes, we do. 
[Bridge]

DATA: It is built into my positronic decompiler. It
will be necessary for me to join the away team, sir. 
PICARD: (hesitation) Proceed, Mister Data.

RIKER: Mister Data. 
DATA: Sir. 
LAFORGE: Let me give you a hand with that, Data. 
(Geordi works with a device Data has brought) 
DATA: Once I have adjusted the forcefield, I will no longer be visible,
Commander. I have taken steps, however, to ensure that you will still
be able to hear me. If you would assist me in a test of the comm.
system. My voice will be transmitted on a delay correlated to the phase
adjustment. That should allow me to maintain verbal contact. 
RIKER: Will we be able to talk to you? 
DATA: No, sir. That will not be possible. 
LAFORGE: The subspace field has been established. You're set to go,
Data. 
DATA: Adjusting the synchronic distortion. Point zero zero one. Point
zero zero two. (fades out) Point zero zero three. Point zero zero four.

DATA [OC]: I have made visual contact. There are lifeforms here.

DATA [OC]: They're either unaware of me or choosing
to ignore me. I am moving approximately ten metres north of my starting
position to observe more closely.
