OMAG RIKER WORF PICARD AMARIE SPOCK DATA

[Klingon quarters]

(Data is back to his android self when Spock and
Picard enter) 
PICARD: Have you had any success, Mister Data?
DATA: Negative, Captain. The Romulan Information net employs a
progressive encryption lock. I have been unable to penetrate their
security measures.
SPOCK: May I assist you, Commander? I have had some experience in these
matters.
DATA: By all means, Ambassador.
SPOCK: The Romulans have incorporated a forty three part cipher key
into their entry sequence. 
DATA: Yes, sir, the twenty ninth is the only one I cannot bypass. 
PICARD: I think I'll take this opportunity to remove my ears. 
(Picard leaves) 
SPOCK: He intrigues me, this Picard.
DATA: In what manner, sir?
SPOCK: Remarkably analytical and dispassionate, for a human. I
understand why my father chose to mind-meld with him. There's almost a
Vulcan quality to the man.
DATA: Interesting. I have not considered that. And Captain Picard has
been a role model in my quest to be more human.
SPOCK: More human?
DATA: Yes, Ambassador.
SPOCK: Fascinating. You have an efficient intellect, superior physical
skills and no emotional impediments. There are Vulcans who aspire all
their lives to achieve what you've been given by design.
DATA: You are half human. 
SPOCK: Yes.
DATA: Yet you have chosen a Vulcan way of life. 
SPOCK: I have.
DATA: In effect, you have abandoned what I have sought all my life.
SPOCK: I believe I have isolated the twenty ninth cipher access code. I
shall attempt to access the Proconsul's files.
DATA: Ambassador Spock, may I ask a personal question?
SPOCK: Please.
DATA: As you examine your life, do you find you have missed your
humanity?
SPOCK: I have no regrets.
DATA: No regrets. That is a human expression.
SPOCK: Yes. Fascinating.

[Piano bar]

WORF: Do you know any Klingon opera?
AMARIE: I don't get a lot of requests for it.
WORF: Surely, you must know at least one theme from Aktuh and Maylota.
AMARIE: I may be a little rusty. 
(with a pounding discord, she starts to sing an aria, and Worf joins
in. A fat Ferengi enters with a tall thin female on each arm) 
OMAG: What is that dreadful noise? It sounds like a Bardakian pronghorn
moose. You know what I want to hear.
AMARIE: Yes, yes, I know. 
WORF: Worf to Enterprise. 
RIKER [OC]: Go ahead. 
WORF: A fat Ferengi
