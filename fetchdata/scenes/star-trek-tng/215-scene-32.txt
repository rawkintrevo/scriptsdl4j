(Worf is gazing at the business end of a phaser) 
PICARD [OC]: Mister Worf acknowledge. Can you hear me, Mister Worf? 
TROI: Yes, Bridge. He can hear you.

Captain's log, supplemental. Following an aborted
attempt to take control of the Bridge, Counsellor Troi, Mister Data,
and Chief O'Brien have seized Ten Forward. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Position security teams at both entrances. 
RO: (at tactical) Yes sir. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, shut down all computer access to Ten Forward. 
LAFORGE: (at ops) I can't, Captain. They've already set up a remote
security lock out. We'd have to shut down all computer function in the
saucer section. 
RIKER: Transporter room three, can you get a pattern lock on Commander
Data, Counselor Troi 
[Transporter room]

RIKER [OC]: And Chief O'Brien in Ten Forward? 
CREWMAN: Attempting to lock on, sir.

[Ten Forward]

O'BRIEN: You were correct. They're attempting to
engage their transporters. But I know how to shut them down. 
DATA: Do it. 
[Transporter room]

CREWMAN: Bridge, the entire transporter array has
been taken off line and placed into diagnostic mode. 
[Bridge]

CREWMAN [OC]: I can't override. It'll take a couple
of hours to complete the cycle. 
PICARD: How many people are down there? 
RO: Seventeen. They just shut down the internal scanners too, Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher to the Bridge. 
CRUSHER [OC]: On my way.
