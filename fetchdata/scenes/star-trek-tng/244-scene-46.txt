[Corridor]

(The sweep is halfway through the saucer section) 
(Picard shoots Pomet in the leg, and he passes out. Picard is just
getting his weapon when ) 
KIROS: Hold it. Put your weapon down. Kelsey, this is Kiros. I'm on
deck ten. 
[Jefferies tube]

KIROS [OC]: I have Mott. 
KELSEY: Is he alive? 
KIROS [OC]: Yes. 
KELSEY: Good. Meet us at intersection forty one. 
KIROS [OC]: Understood.

[Corridor]

KIROS: This way. Move.

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: Give me the trilithium. 
NEIL: How much farther do we have to go? 
KELSEY: Not far. With all the modifications you've made to this unit,
are we going to have any troubles removing the trilithium? 
NEIL: No. Just remove the control rod, drain the unit. There shouldn't
be any problem. 
KELSEY: That's all I wanted to know. 
(we can assume she kills Neil) 
[Corridor]

KELSEY: Well, not as clever as you thought. Where's
Pomet? 
KIROS: He shot him with some kind of an arrow. 
PICARD: He's not dead. 
KELSEY: Well, he will be soon. The sweep's nearly here. We don't have
time to go back for him. 
KIROS: What about Neil? 
KELSEY: The sweep got him. Let's go. 
[Arkaria base]

TROI: I thought you were just going to talk to him.

RIKER: I did. He just didn't like what I had to say. 
(an alarm sounds, and Orton goes to a computer terminal in a recess) 
DATA: That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small ship
is approaching. I believe Mister Orton has dropped his defence shields.

RIKER: This must be the sign they were waiting for. Mister Data, you
will be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst. As soon as
every else is unconscious, I need you to get to the computer panel and
stop that ship somehow. 
DATA: I will try, sir. 
CRUSHER: Now. 
(an ear-splitting noise fills the room, and all the people drop. Data
takes the weapons and starts work on the computer) 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. 
KELSEY: You're the only one who needs a deal, Mot. 
PICARD: My name isn't Mot. It's Jean-Luc Picard. 
KELSEY: Captain Picard. This is all beginning to make sense. 
PICARD: Leave the trilithium here and take me with you. You can use me
as a hostage instead of threatening 
KELSEY: I'm not a terrorist Captain, nor do I have a political agenda,
although I know some people who do have agendas. And they are very
interested in this little container. 
PICARD: Profit. This is all about profit. 
KELSEY: I prefer to think of it as commerce. Open the door. Now go
through, slowly.

[Ten Forward]

(Picard, Kiros, then Kelsey enter. A blue stripe on
the floor flares, blinding the two women. Kelsey drops the container.
She and Picard fight, then the sweep enters the room. They continue to
wrestle until Kelsey finally gets her hands on a weapon again) 
KELSEY: I guess, I'll be the one to send your regrets. 
(Kelsey and the container are beamed out. Picard uses the terrorist
communicator.) 
PICARD: Picard to Arkaria base. Deactivate the baryon sweep. Arkaria
Base, this is Captain Picard on board the Enterprise. Deactivate the
baryon sweep! 
(Picard takes final refuge in Ten-Forward's windows) 
PICARD: Arkaria Base, this is Captain Picard. Deactivate the baryon
sweep immediately! 
(and the sweep stops) 
DATA [OC]: Data to Captain Picard. Do you read me, sir? 
PICARD: Picard here.

[Arkaria base]

(Riker has Orton and the waiter under guard) 
DATA: Are you all right, Captain?
