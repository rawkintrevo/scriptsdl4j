TROI LAFORGE DATAIHAT PICARD DATAVICTIM DATA

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Lower synaptic functions are completely
normal. Autonomous systems all check out. 
DATA: I suggest we examine the memory subsystem next. 
LAFORGE: All right. (Data twitches) Data, what's wrong? 
DATA: I am not certain. I am experiencing a curious sensation. 
LAFORGE: Well, what is it? 
DATA: An impulse. 
LAFORGE: Impulse? What kind of impulse? 
DATA: I do not know. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to check out your higher functions. 
DATA: Geordi, what does it feel like when a person is losing his mind? 
LAFORGE: Data, come on, you're scaring me now. What's going on? 
DATA: I do not know. I am different. 
LAFORGE: Well, you're going to be all right. You're with me, okay? 
DATA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Listen, I'm going to disconnect you. (does so) What's going
on? 
(Data's circuitry has changed) 
LAFORGE: Data. 
(Data has the compass symbol on his forehead and a wicked grin) 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking. 
(after the break, Data is sitting on the warp core as Picard enters.
There is a symbol on his chest.) 
LAFORGE: Captain 
DATA-IHAT: Captain. I've been waiting for you. You should feel
honoured. I don't usually wait for anyone. 
PICARD: What is it you want? 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka is waking. 
PICARD: Are you Masaka? 
DATA-IHAT: I am not Masaka. I am Ihat. 
PICARD: What have you done to Commander Data? 
DATA-IHAT: Commander Data? You mean the one who was here? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA-IHAT: He's gone. Who can say where? 
PICARD: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering
immediately. 
DATA-IHAT: Picard to Counsellor Troi. Report to main Engineering
immediately. 
PICARD: Ihat, this place you come from, is it a cultural archive of
your species? 
DATA-IHAT: I come from Masaka's city. 
PICARD: Are there others like you there? 
(Data goes to lie on the 'pool table') 
DATA-IHAT: There are no others like me. 
PICARD: Who is Masaka? 
DATA-IHAT: You will find out. 
PICARD: I would like to know Masaka, speak with her. 
DATA-IHAT: Do you understand pain? Death? That is all you need to know
of Masaka. It is what she is. Go. Leave this place before she finds
you. It can be done. I did it. 
(Troi enters) 
DATA-IHAT: Masaka. 
(Data kneels before her in fear, and when he looks up again, there is a
different symbol on his chest) 
DATA-VICTIM: I am yours. Every part of me is yours. 
PICARD: We should confine him to quarters.

[Observation lounge]

(Pos net micrograph 289.25 on the wall monitor) 
LAFORGE: This is a micrograph of what's happened to Data's positronic
net. Now, as near as I can tell, these are behavioural nodes. I've
counted fourteen so far. I think the archive is using Data to create
different people within its culture much in the same way it used our
replicators to create artefacts. 
TROI: As a result, Data's real personality has been completely buried.
In a sense, Data has the android equivalent of multiple personalities. 
LAFORGE: The archive hasn't stopped yet. Data's positronic net is still
being transformed. There's no telling how many more personalities might
emerge. 
PICARD: Geordi, I want you to continue to scan the archive. See if you
can find some way to access it. And in the meantime, I'll see what I
can learn from these people inside Data.
