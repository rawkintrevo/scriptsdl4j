[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Report to Shuttlebay two immediately. 
LAFORGE: I'm on my way. 
[Shuttlebay two]

PICARD: I'll be in Sickbay. Keep me informed. 
RIKER: Captain, seen this? 
PICARD: Looks like the damage caused by an antimatter explosion. 
RIKER: It must have been just out of range of the shuttlecraft. 
PICARD: Data, I need those logs. Counsellor. 
RIKER: We'll be on the Bridge. Lieutenant. 
(Geordi enters as Riker and Worf leave)

[Bridge]

RIKER: Resume course and speed. Scanners at maximum
range. 
WORF: Maximum range.

[Shuttlebay two]

LAFORGE: There you go. You should have power now. 
(Data touches a panel, and sparks fly) 
LAFORGE: What happened? 
DATA: The polarity is not compatible. 
LAFORGE: That's not possible. The connection's idiot proof. 
DATA: The power requirements of the shuttle do not match those of the
Enterprise. We will need a variable phase inverter, to align the power
from the Enterprise to the circuits of the shuttle. 
LAFORGE: Data, what do you think is going on here? I don't mean just
with the shuttle, I mean everything. 
DATA: I do not have enough information.
