kind angry difficulty time yes moves friends dragged creatures

[Planet surface]

CRUSHER: We've encountered some difficulty.

[Shuttlecraft]

TROI: I know. 
[Planet surface]

RIKER: She needs our help. 
ARMUS: So what. 
CRUSHER: Our friends are suffering only a few metres away, yet you
block our path. Why? 
ARMUS: You are all ungrateful. 
CRUSHER: What is he made of? 
DATA: It did not register on the tricorder. 
ARMUS: It? Does that mean I am not alive? 
DATA: No. Clearly you are some kind of intelligent form. 
ARMUS: But you said I did not register on your instrument. Perhaps your
instruments are useless. 
(Data's tricorder and phaser fly away, and Geordi's visor falls to the
ground. He gropes to find it) 
ARMUS: Don't help him. 
RIKER: Data. 
DATA: Half metre to the right, Geordi. (Armus moves it again) 
ARMUS: Aren't you going to lead him to his sight again, robot? 
DATA: No. You will just move it again, and I will not help you hurt
him. 
ARMUS: Then give it to him. I will find something else to amuse me. 
(The slick covers the shuttlecraft again)

[Shuttlecraft]

ARMUS [OC]: You said they wouldn't amuse me. You
were right. 
TROI: And the emptiness remains. You sound so alone. 
ARMUS [OC]: I am alone. 
TROI: Abandoned. Who deserted you? 
ARMUS [OC]: Creatures whose beauty now dazzles all who see them. They
would not exist without me. 
TROI: You were together? 
ARMUS [OC]: They perfected a means of bringing to the surface all that
was evil and negative within. Erupting, spreading, connecting. In time
it formed second skin, dank and vile. 
TROI: You. 
ARMUS [OC]: Yes. 
TROI: They discarded you and left. 
ARMUS [OC]: And here I am. 
TROI: You have my pity. 
(Armus gets angry and shakes the shuttlecraft) 
ARMUS [OC]: Your pity? Save that for yourself.

[Planet surface]

(The team are not watching when Armus leaves the
shuttlecraft and approaches them. Riker is grabbed by an invisible
force and dragged by the feet to the slick) 
RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! 
ARMUS: Touch him and he dies. 
RIKER: No! No, don't! 
(Riker disappears into the slick) 
DATA: Enterprise?

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. 
PICARD: I'm beaming you up. 
[Planet surface]

ARMUS: If any of you leave now, he dies.
