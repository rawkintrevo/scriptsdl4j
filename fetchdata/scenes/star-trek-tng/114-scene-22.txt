RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD WESLEY LORE CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Well, Number One?
RIKER: It was Lore, sir. Same facial twitches that we've seen all
along. Lying unconscious on the floor exactly as Data had described.
But then it suddenly became violent, apparently sensing that Wesley and
I were present. 
WESLEY: Or is it Lore pretending to be Data and faking it all?
PICARD: I asked for Commander Riker's report, Acting Ensign Crusher.
And since it now seems clear that you are unable to function within the
limits of that appointment
LAFORGE: Captain!
(The entity is starting to send rays their way) 
TASHA: Deflector shields holding, sir.
PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready. Main phasers to ready. Go to
Red Alert, please.
(Data/Lore enters) 
WORF: Weapons now ready, sir. 
LORE: No, Captain, let me talk to it. 
PICARD: You didn't say you could do that. (the ship shakes)
Affirmative. Talk to it.
LORE: Open hailing frequencies. Crystal form, I identify myself as
Data, advising you to stop your attack. The humans here are powerful,
capable of injuring or even destroying you. 
(The attack stops) 
LAFORGE: Now I call that communicating.
LORE: Suggest moving fast to confirm what I told it, sir. Permission to
use the large transporter in cargo room three. There I can beam up some
living pattern, perhaps a large tree.
RIKER: Which you'll beam over next to the entity
LORE: That is correct, Riker. Our ship's phasers will then blast and
disintegrate it, proving we are dangerous.
PICARD: Make it so. 
LORE: Sir?
PICARD: Do it. 
(Lore leaves) 
WESLEY: Sir, I know this may finish me as an Acting Ensign, but 
PICARD: Shut up, Wesley! Lieutenant, pick a good security team, let me
know what he does.
TASHA: Aye, sir. 
CRUSHER: Shut up, Wesley?
PICARD: Doctor. 
WESLEY: And since I am finished here, sir, may I point out that 
CRUSHER: Shut up, Wesley!
WESLEY: That everything that I have said would have been listened to if
it came from an adult officer. Request permission to return to my
quarters, sir.
PICARD: Agreed. Doctor, go with him.
CRUSHER: You're putting me off the Bridge?
PICARD: I'm asking that you keep an eye on your son during all of this,
Doctor.

[Turbolift]

(Worf is leading the security team, but gets cut
off from them when -) 
LORE: Emergency close! 
(He slaps the phaser out of Worf's hand) 
LORE: Now, show me your warrior fierceness. 
(Of course, flesh and blood is no match for the machine)

[Data's Quarters]

CRUSHER: I'll look. But I shouldn't have let you
talk me into this. 
WESLEY: Mom, it's Data. He's been hurt. It's Data, Mom. I heard you
know how to turn them on. 
CRUSHER: This is very serious. 
WESLEY: So just tell me to shut up, Wesley, and I will.
CRUSHER: You're being very unfair, Wes.
(She switches Data on) 
WESLEY: Data, the Crystal Thing is outside somewhere close to the ship,
and Lore is loose on the inside.
CRUSHER: How badly are you hurt, Data?
DATA: I will function sufficiently to stop Lore, Doctor
