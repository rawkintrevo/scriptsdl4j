NURSE: Oh, you'll wear yourself out with all that
pacing, Milady. 
VASH: I told you to stop calling me that. The name's Vash. 
NURSE: My poor lamb. You've got a brain sickness for sure. Can't I get
you something to ease your suffering? 
VASH: I could use a drink. 
NURSE: Well, I wasn't thinking of spirits, Milady, but I have some nice
fresh leeches. To drain the fever. 
VASH: Out. Get out. 
NURSE: Oh, her mind's in an awful turmoil, Sir Guy. 
VASH: Who the hell are you? 
NURSE: Milady, everyone in Nottingham knows, Sir Guy of Gisbourne. 
VASH: Sir Guy of what? 
SIR GUY: Leave us. 
(the nurse leaves) 
SIR GUY: Do not mock me, Lady Marian. I'm prepared to offer you one
last chance to change your mind. Will you marry me? 
(Vash slaps his face) 
SIR GUY: I see. Then the execution will proceed as scheduled. 
VASH: What execution? 
SIR GUY: I warn you, Marian, this pathetic attempt at feigning madness
will not save your life. 
VASH: You mean I'm the one being executed? Sir Guy, wait a minute.
Couldn't we talk this over? I admit, I haven't been myself lately.
Maybe we've both been a bit hasty? Please?

[Forest glade]

(Geordi is still plucking at the instrument when
Worf walks over, takes it off him and smashes it against a tree trunk) 
WORF: Sorry. 
(Troi is still learning to use a bow and arrow, She aims at a tree and
hits Data instead) 
TROI: Data, are you alright? 
DATA: The arrow impacted just above my sixth intercostal support,
penetrating my secondary subprocessor. Fortunately, none of my
biofunctions seem affected. Do not be concerned, Counsellor. I believe
your aim is improving. 
RIKER: We've got to get out of here, Captain. 
PICARD: Not we, Number One. I want you and the others to stay here
until I return. 
RIKER: You're not going to try to save her yourself, sir? 
PICARD: This is not a mission. It's personal. It's between Q and
myself. I don't want the rest of you involved. 
RIKER: Captain! 
PICARD: You have your orders, Commander. And I expect you to follow
them.
