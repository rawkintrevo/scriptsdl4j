[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We've completed our analysis of the bomb
debris, Commander. 
DATA: The explosive was a triceron derivative. 
LAFORGE: And the entire device couldn't have been more than three cubic
millimetres in size. 
RIKER: It could have been hidden anywhere in that room. 
LAFORGE: There's one more thing. The bomb had a molecular-decay
detonator. 
DATA: Only one race uses that device, sir. 
RIKER: The Romulans.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: How could the Romulans plant a bomb on
board a Klingon attack cruiser? 
WORF: It would be impossible. 
K'EHLEYR: Not if the Romulans had help from one of the Klingons. 
LAFORGE: Klingons and Romulans working together? They've been blood
enemies for seventy five years. 
PICARD: Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes to improve that relationship. 
RIKER: A new Klingon alliance with the Romulans? 
DATA: If true, it would represent a fundamental shift of power in the
quadrant. 
PICARD: Indeed. It would put the Federation in a very difficult
position. 
RIKER: Duras or Gowron? 
K'EHLEYR: Gowron came to me alone. He wanted me to speed up the
ja'chuq. Offered me a seat on the Council if I'd help him. 
PICARD: That doesn't suggest a Romulan connection? 
K'EHLEYR: He also implied I'd end up like K'mpec if I didn't cooperate.

WORF: Captain, I disagree. It must be Duras. 
K'EHLEYR: Why? 
PICARD: We have had prior dealings with Duras that show him to be
untrustworthy. 
K'EHLEYR: Can you be more specific? 
PICARD: No. Mister Worf, we have a conspiracy on our hands that could
be a direct threat to the security of the Federation. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: As Chief Security Officer, you will accompany me to the next
transition proceeding. 
WORF: Captain, they will be incensed. My presence will be disruptive. 
PICARD: Yes, it will.

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

K'EHLEYR: Computer, list stardates of the last
Enterprise mission to the Klingon home planet. 
COMPUTER: Stardates 43685 through 43689. 
K'EHLEYR: How many ship's logs during that period? 
COMPUTER: Forty three officer's logs. Ten personal logs. 
K'EHLEYR: Is there a personal log for Lieutenant Worf? 
COMPUTER: Affirmative. Access is restricted. 
K'EHLEYR: Eliminate all personal logs. List the remaining forty three
in chronological order. We'll just take them one at a time.

GOWRON: jIH DoQ batlh! 
PICARD: Both your claims have been properly made and recorded. We are
ready for the final phase of the ja'chuq. There will be a recess while
I review your petitions. I'm sure you're as concerned as I am about the
explosion aboard K'mpec's vessel. I assume that you are both continuing
your investigations? 
GOWRON: The investigations are complete. They revealed nothing of any
importance. 
PICARD: Now that's very surprising. Our analysis turned up some
startling results. (into
comm.) Will you join us, Lieutenant? 
(Worf enters) 
DURAS: What is this? 
GOWRON: He has no place here, Picard! 
DURAS: I will not sit at the same table with that! 
PICARD: It is my prerogative to investigate anything that may be
relevant to the Rite of Succession. Lieutenant Worf is my Chief
Security Officer. His presence is required. 
DURAS: We will not proceed. 
PICARD: If you wish to withdraw from the ja'chuq, that is your option.
Proceed, Mister Worf. 
WORF: What did your investigations reveal about the explosion? 
DURAS: It was a bomb. 
WORF: And was your analysis just as insightful? 
GOWRON: It was a common explosive. 
WORF: What type? 
GOWRON: Triceron. 
WORF: What about the detonator? 
DURAS: This is pointless! The findings were inconclusive. 
WORF: Fortunately, our investigation was more thorough. The bomb used a
molecular-decay detonator. 
GOWRON: What? 
PICARD: A Romulan device. 
DURAS: I will return to my ship to confirm these conclusions myself. 
GOWRON: As will I. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, please be sure to send a complete record of our
findings to both vessels and to the High Council. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: That will be all.
