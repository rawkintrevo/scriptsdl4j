PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA SAREK

[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, the Legarans are ready to beam
aboard. 
RIKER: Very well. 
SAREK: Number One, please inform the Legaran delegation that Sarek of
Vulcan is on his way to welcome them. 
RIKER: Yes, Ambassador.

[Corridor]

RIKER: I take it the mind-meld was a success? 
SAREK: Yes. All went as planned. 
RIKER: Is Captain Picard all right? 
SAREK: Don't worry, Number One. 
RIKER: And the Ambassador? 
SAREK: I am myself again. It has been a long time. 
[Picard's quarters]

(Jean-Luc is voicing the agony Sarek had been
keeping locked inside himself) 
PICARD: No! It is wrong. It is wrong! A lifetime of discipline washed
away, and in its place bedlam. Bedlam! I am so old. There is nothing
left but dry bones and dead friends. Tired, oh so tired. 
CRUSHER: It will pass, all of it. Just another hour or so. You're doing
fine. Just hold on. 
PICARD: No! This weakness disgusts me! I hate it! Where is my logic? I
am betrayed by desires. I want to feel. I want to feel everything. But
I am a Vulcan. I must feel nothing. Give me back my control. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc! 
PICARD: Perrin. Amanda. I wanted to give you so much more. I wanted to
show you such tenderness. But that is not our way. Spock, Amanda, did
you know? Perrin, can you know how much I love you? I do love you! 
(Beverly comes over to wipe his tears) 
PICARD: Beverly. 
CRUSHER: I'm here, Jean-Luc. I'm not going anywhere. 
PICARD: It's quite difficult. The anguish of the man, the despair
pouring out of him, all those feelings, the regrets. I can't stop them.

(He falls, sobbing, into her arms) 
PICARD: I can't stop them. I can't. I can't. 
CRUSHER: Don't even try.
