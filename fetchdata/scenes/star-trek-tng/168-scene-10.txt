LAFORGE: We've got impulse power, but I've got to
take the warp engines offline while we recalibrate the intermix
regulators. 
RIKER: How long? 
LAFORGE: For everything, or just for the warp engine? 
RIKER: All of it. 
LAFORGE: Commander, we're looking at twenty hours work here, double
shifts. 
RIKER: We don't know that we have twenty hours. That star could explode
at any moment. 
LAFORGE: I know. Okay, first thing we need to do is get the main
computer working right. 
RIKER: No, we fix the shields first. 
LAFORGE: Commander, whatever Tin Man hit us with, it fried circuits I
thought were unfryable. 
RIKER: I'm not worried about Tin Man. It's more Romulans showing up. 
LAFORGE: Right. First priority, get the shields up. Only let's not have
any more surprises till I'm done, okay? 
RIKER: Don't ask me about surprises. Ask Tam Elbrun.

CRUSHER: Your brain activity suggests that you're
coming out of a sort of fugue, or seizure. Your blood pressure and
glucose are indicative of general systemic stress. 
TAM: But I'm going to live? 
CRUSHER: No doubt about it. 
PICARD: Good. Because I want to know exactly what you did. I want to
know how closely you are in communication with the alien, and what
you've learned about it, and I want to know now. 
TAM: I just warned it, that's all. I've been in contact with it,
sensing impressions from it. It calls itself Gomtuu. It's old, Captain.
It's roamed the universe for many thousands of years. 
PICARD: Where did it come from? How many 
TAM: Far away. Maybe beyond the galaxy. Once there were millions of
them. 
PICARD: Once? 
TAM: It hasn't seen another of its kind for millennia. It's alone. It
may be the last of its species. 
PICARD: Perhaps we can help it in some way. Can you ask it to return
with us to Federation space? At least persuade it to leave the vicinity
of Beta Stromgren, before the star explodes? 
TAM: Captain, Gomtuu knows that the star will go nova soon. That's why
it's here. It wants to die. There was an explosion in space. Radiation
penetrating the outer layers. The crew. Oh, the crew died. Such loss.
Empty pain, Hollowness. 
TROI: Tam. Stop this! You're losing yourself in this this merging. 
TAM: I know. I know. Tin Man hurts and wants to die. I can't do any
more from out here. If you want me to really reach Tin Man, I have got
to be in physical contact. I have got to go aboard. 
PICARD: No. That is absolutely out of the question. 
TAM: You don't trust me. 
PICARD: No, Tam, I don't believe that I do. Tam, when you reached out
to the alien, to warn it, did you give any thought to this vessel? To
the danger, however inadvertent, that creature might pose to our crew?
Or did you simply react out of instinct? 
TROI: Captain 
TAM: Deanna, he's right. I don't know. I don't know what might happen
but if you don't let me go, we fail our mission. Besides, at this
point, you need all the help you can get. Even Tin Man's.
