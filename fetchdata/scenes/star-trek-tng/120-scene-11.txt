[Bridge]

PICARD: And as I watched Worf, it was like looking
at a man that I had never known. 
DATA: Captain, long range sensors indicate another vessel approaching
this area. 
PICARD: Can you identify it? 
DATA: No, sir, not yet. 
PICARD: Keep a close watch on it. So close to the Neutral Zone it can't
be random.

[Engineering]

GUEST0: What magnificent battles we could have at
the helm of this ship. 
WORF: Perhaps your dreams of glory no longer fit the time. They belong
buried with the past. 
KORRIS: Standing here we will never know. Our answer lies out there.
Our instincts will lead us. 
GUEST0: Instincts that have not been dulled by living among civilised
men.

[Bridge]

DATA: I believe, sir, that was the first time
outsiders have witnessed the Klingon death ritual. 
PICARD: I can understand them looking at a dying man's eyes, but the
howling? 
DATA: It was a warning. 
PICARD: To whom? 
DATA: They are warning the dead, sir. Beware, a Klingon warrior is
about to arrive. 
LAFORGE: Captain, that unidentified vessel is approaching us at warp
five. Intersect one hour, sixteen minutes, thirty three seconds. 
PICARD: Can we get a visual? 
LAFORGE: I can try, sir. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
LAFORGE: Hello. 
RIKER: Klingons. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open. 
PICARD: Klingon cruiser, this is Captain Jean Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: I am Commander K'Nera. What is your purpose in
this area? 
PICARD: We came to investigate a battle. We rescued three Klingon
survivors. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: That is all that is left of the crew of the
cruiser T'Acog? 
PICARD: They were not off the cruiser. They were from the freighter
Batris. The leader is Captain Korris. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: You have him on your ship? He is alive? 
PICARD: Yes. 
K'NERA [on viewscreen]: He is a criminal. A renegade, who with two
others stole that freighter, and somehow destroyed the Klingon cruiser
sent to bring them back. We expect the criminals to be delivered into
our custody as soon as we are within transporter range. 
(ends transmission) 
PICARD: Lieutenant Yar, where are they now? 
TASHA: They're with Worf on deck seventeen. 
PICARD: Deck seventeen? 
TASHA: Yes, sir. Near the auxiliary turbolift to the battle bridge.
Shall I alert Lieutenant Worf? 
PICARD: No. Send a security team. 
RIKER: You don't think Worf would allow them access to the battle
bridge? 
PICARD: I think, Number One, we cannot assume anything. 
TASHA: Captain, shall I stay at my tactical position or lead the
security team? 
PICARD: Lead the security team, and, Lieutenant, you understand with
whom you are dealing. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.
