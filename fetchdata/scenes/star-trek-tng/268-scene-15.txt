help wish tricorder called looking won village talur day

[Town square]

(night, Data uncovers the well and is about to pour
his bucket of cure into it when) 
SKORAN: There he is! You see? It's just as I said. 
DATA: I only wish to help. 
SKORAN: This is how you've helped us, by bringing this plague? Tried to
kill us all? Well, you won't succeed. I won't let you! 
(Data pours the compound into the well just as Skoran impales him and
gets an electric shock for his effort. Data falls as Talur arrives)

[Town square]

(another day, and Gia is going to school with her
slate) 
CRUSHER: Excuse me. We're looking for a friend of ours. He might have
wandered into your village a few days ago. 
RIKER: You'd remember him. He would have appeared very strange. Pale
skin, gold eyes. 
GIA: He was your friend? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Do you know him? 
RIKER: Where is he? 
(Gia points to a plaque on a stone) 
CRUSHER: I don't understand. 
GIA: We didn't know his real name, so we called him Jayden. 
RIKER: You're saying he's dead? 
GIA: They killed him because they were afraid of him, but he saved all
of us from the sickness. 
CRUSHER: The sickness? 
GIA: There were these pieces of metal. They made everyone sick. But
Jayden put something in the water and now everyone's better. 
RIKER: What happened to these pieces of metal? 
GIA: We buried them in the forest. What was his real name? 
RIKER: Data. 
GIA: Data. He was my friend, too. 
(Gia leaves and Beverly gets her tricorder out) 
CRUSHER: It's Data all right. He's buried about two metres down. He's
been deactivated so I can't tell how bad the damage is. 
RIKER: We could beam him and the probe fragments right onto the ship.
No one would know.
