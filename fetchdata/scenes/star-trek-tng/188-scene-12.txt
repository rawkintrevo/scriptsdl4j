TROI OBRIEN LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Apparently we were all unconscious for
about thirty seconds. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Is everybody all right there? 
PICARD: There's little or no damage on the Bridge, Doctor. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Acknowledged. Crusher out.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ship's status? 
RIKER: Reports coming in now. Nothing serious so far. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here, Captain. I've checked impulse engines and
warp drives, sir. They appear to be unaffected. 
WORF: Shields and weapons systems are fully functional. 
PICARD: Counsellor? Are you all right? 
TROI: I think so. I'm feeling a bit unfocused. It'll pass. 
PICARD: Well, not too bad, all things considered. 
RIKER: We're lucky we didn't end up half way across the galaxy in the
middle of next week. 
DATA: That was never actually a possibility. The wormhole's small size
and relatively short period would make this a local phenomenon. 
PICARD: There's still the anomalous M-class planet we were going to
investigate. Do we go back? 
DATA: The unpredictability of the wormhole would make an investigation
a hazardous one. A probe launched from our current position would be
more advisable. 
PICARD: Make it so.

[Sickbay]

(O'Brien has a bad elbow) 
CRUSHER: Nothing broken, Chief, but the ligaments around the elbow have
been twisted pretty severely. What on earth were you doing when you
fell? 
O'BRIEN: Hanging a plant for Keiko. It's part of her running project to
give me a green thumb. 
CRUSHER: How's it working? 
O'BRIEN: Everything I touch seems to turn brown and wither away. 
CRUSHER: Alyssa, would you get me? Oh, never mind, I'll get it. You,
don't go away. 
[Sickbay lab]

(during the opening log, Beverly had been doing
something scientific with modules. Now she sees them again, full of
fuzzy pink stuff) 
CRUSHER: This isn't possible.
