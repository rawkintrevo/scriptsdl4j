[Observation lounge]

LAFORGE: If this works the way I think it will,
once the invasive programme starts spreading, it'll only be a matter of
months before the Borg suffer total systems failure.
PICARD: Comments.
CRUSHER: A question. What exactly is total systems failure?
DATA: The Borg are extremely computer dependent. A systems failure will
destroy them.
CRUSHER: I just think we should be plain about that. We're talking
about annihilating an entire race.
PICARD: Which under most circumstances would be unconscionable. But as
I see it, the Borg leave us with little choice.
RIKER: I agree. We're at war.
CRUSHER: There's been no formal declaration of war.
TROI: Not from us, but certainly from them. They've attacked us in
every encounter.
PICARD: They've declared war on our way of life. We are to be
assimilated.
CRUSHER: But even in war there are rules. You don't kill civilians
indiscriminately.
RIKER: There are no civilians among the Borg.
PICARD: Think of them as a single, collective being. There's no one
Borg who is more an individual than your arm or your leg.
CRUSHER: How convenient.
PICARD: Your point, Doctor?
CRUSHER: When I look at my patient, I don't see a collective
consciousness. I don't see a hive. I see a living, breathing boy who's
been hurt and who needs our help. And we're talking about sending him
back to his people as an instrument of destruction.
PICARD: It comes down to this. We're faced with an enemy who are
determined to destroy us, and we have no hope of negotiating a peace.
Unless that changes, we are justified in doing anything we can to
survive.
SECURITY [OC]: Security to Captain.
PICARD: Picard here.
SECURITY [OC]: The Borg has regained consciousness, sir.
PICARD: Acknowledged. We proceed with the plan.

[Brig]

(the Borg is checking every millimetre of the walls
and forcefield) 
CRUSHER: What's he doing?
PICARD: He's trying to find an access terminal so he can interface with
the collective. He doesn't understand that the signal has been cut off.
LAFORGE: He's emitting a homing signal and a second subspace beacon,
but our damping field is blocking both signals.
PICARD: He's alone. For the first time he's being forced to cope with
his environment without the resources of the Collective.
CRUSHER: He must be hungry. The Borg don't ingest food. Their implants
can synthesise any organic molecules the biological tissues require.
What they need is energy.
PICARD: Arrange to feed it.
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
(Picard leaves) 
LAFORGE: I'll have to adapt a power conduit and install it in there.
CRUSHER: If I didn't know better, I'd think he was scared.

[Gymnasium]

(Picard is fencing and beating an opponent who
turns out to be - ) 
GUINAN: I don't think I like this sport.
PICARD: Last week when you scored two touches, you liked it well
enough. Today you were dropping your foil. You kept letting me inside.
GUINAN: Ah, but if I lift up, you lunge right underneath. Let's face
it, you're just better at this than I am. I understand we have a guest
on board.
PICARD: Yes.
GUINAN: Is that wise?
PICARD: I'm not sure. I hope so.
GUINAN: I thought I understood you, Picard, but I don't understand this.
PICARD: It was an errand of mercy. He was injured, Doctor Crusher
decided for humanitarian reasons to care for him.
GUINAN: They're going to come after us, you know that. You, of all
people, know that.
PICARD: Shall we go again?
(after exchanging parries and thrusts, Guinan grabs her thigh in pain) 
PICARD: Are you all right? 
(she disarms him and scores a touch) 
GUINAN: You felt sorry for me. Look what it got you.

[Brig]

LAFORGE: I'll have to go in to connect the power
conduit.
WORF: I will follow the Commander. Reactivate the field once we're
through.
(the security guard does so. The Borg just watches) 
LAFORGE: Good. Now stay that way.
(the Borg steps forward) 
WORF: Commander.
(Geordi fits the new power conduit) 
BORG: We are Borg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
LAFORGE: Just look around, pal. You're hardly in a position to make any
demands.
BORG: We must return to the Collective.
LAFORGE: Who's we?
BORG: We are Borg.
LAFORGE: Yeah, but there's only one of you. Do you have a name? A means
of identification?
BORG: Third of five.
LAFORGE: There were five on your ship. Is that it? Just a number?
BORG: Third of five.
LAFORGE: It does kind of suit you. Okay. This is for you. It regulates
the power flow to the frequency that you're used to. This connection
should fit
the coupling on your arm. You're welcome. Let's get out of here.
WORF: Lower the forcefield.
(Geordi and Worf back out, the forcefield goes back up, and the Borg
goes to the conduit and plugs himself in) 
LAFORGE: He's hungry, all right.
BORG: Why do you do this?
LAFORGE: I'm just a nice guy at heart. You feeling better?
BORG: You are not Borg.
LAFORGE: That's right. And I hope to stay that way.
BORG: You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile.
LAFORGE: That's gratitude for you.

[Science lab]

(with the apparatus they used when de-Borgifying
Picard) 
LAFORGE: I've been rationing his portions of energy. I think he
understands. When he cooperates, he gets fed. If not.
CRUSHER: Like a rat in a cage.
LAFORGE: Look, if I'm going to figure out his command pathways, I need
to learn how he processes information, and the only way I know to do
that is by giving him perceptual tests. And for that, I need his
cooperation.
CRUSHER: So he can participate in the destruction of his entire species.
LAFORGE: Doctor.
CRUSHER: I know, I know. We're at war. I'm here to help but I don't
have to like it.
LAFORGE: Okay, I think we're ready to transport him. If he gives us any
trouble, we can access the force field through that console. Are you
ready?
LAFORGE: La Forge to transporter room three. We're ready here.
CREWMAN [OC]: We're standing by, Commander.
LAFORGE: Energise.
(the Borg and a security man beam in. The Borg is inside the apparatus
and plugs himself into a power conduit) 
LAFORGE: Third of Five, this is Doctor Crusher. Doctor Crusher, this is
Third of Five. 
CRUSHER: Hello.
BORG: What is a doctor?
CRUSHER: A doctor heals the sick and repairs the injured.
BORG: The sick and injured are reabsorbed. Others take their place.
CRUSHER: That isn't what happen to you. When we found you, you were
dying. I saved your life.
BORG: Why?
CRUSHER: It's my duty to help those who are hurt.
BORG: You give us food.
LAFORGE: Yeah.
BORG: Is that your duty?
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's right. Listen, Third of Five, Doctor Crusher here
has repaired a lot of the damage to your biochip implants. We want to
run a few tests, make sure everything's working okay.
BORG: Tests?
CRUSHER: I'd like to show you a few diagrams and ask you some questions
about them. It's very simple really.
BORG: You will be assimilated.
LAFORGE: Yes, but before that happens, could we ask you a few questions?
BORG: We will answer.
LAFORGE: Terrific. All right, hang on just a second here, Third of Five.
BORG: What is your designation?
LAFORGE: Designation?
BORG: Third of Five. 
CRUSHER: You mean our names. We don't have designations. We have names.
I'm Beverly. This is Geordi.
BORG: Do I have a name?
LAFORGE: Do you want one?
BORG: A name.
CRUSHER: I'm Beverly, he's Geordi, and you.
BORG: You 
CRUSHER: You 
LAFORGE: No, no, wait a minute. That's it. Hugh. What do you think?
BORG: You.
LAFORGE: No, not you. Hugh.
BORG: Hugh.
CRUSHER: Okay. Now, I'm Beverly.
LAFORGE: I'm Geordi.
BORG: We are Hugh.
(later, Hugh is out of the contraption looking at images on a wall
monitor) 
CRUSHER: Now imagine what this shape would look like if it were turned
inside out. Which one is it?
BORG: This one.
CRUSHER: That's right. He's gotten every one. Eight out of eight. That
blows the top right off the spatial-acuity percentiles.
LAFORGE: It's the prosthetic eye. It seems to be giving him very
complex visual information.
CRUSHER: Like some kind of holographic imaging system.
LAFORGE: That could be helpful. Hugh, I'd like to take a closer look at
your eyepiece. Is that okay?
BORG: Here.
(he takes the eyepiece off and hands it to Geordi)
LAFORGE: Thanks.
BORG: When you are assimilated, you will have a similar device.
CRUSHER: Hugh, do you understand we don't want to be assimilated?
BORG: Why do you resist us?
CRUSHER: Because we don't want to live the way you do.
BORG: Here it is quiet. There are no other voices.
LAFORGE: Other voices?
BORG: On a Borg ship we live with the thoughts of the others in our
minds. Thousands of voices with us always.
CRUSHER: I think what you're saying is that you're lonely.
LAFORGE: Here.
(he puts the eyepiece back on) 
BORG: When you have completed these tests, what will be done with us?
LAFORGE: We'll er, we'll send you home.
BORG: We will rejoin the Collective.

[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: You know, it's funny. When I first
creating this invasive programme I didn't have a problem with it. The
more I work with Hugh, the more I 
GUINAN: Hugh?
LAFORGE: That's what we call him.
GUINAN: You named the Borg? 
LAFORGE: Well, it was easier to have something to call him.
GUINAN: Oh, so now you have a Borg named Hugh.
LAFORGE: Right. And he's nothing like what I expected.
GUINAN: How so?
LAFORGE: I don't know. It's like he's just some kid who's far way from
home.
GUINAN: Do you know that you're the second person today to refer to
that Borg as though it were some sort of lost child.
LAFORGE: Anyway, I'm having second thoughts about what we're doing
here. I mean, programming him like some sort of walking bomb. Sending
him back to
destroy the others.
GUINAN: Let me tell you something. When that kid's big brothers come
looking for him, they're not going to stop until they find him. And
then they're going to come looking for us, and they will destroy us.
And they will not do any of the soul-searching that you are apparently
doing right now.
LAFORGE: Then why don't you go and talk to him. It might not be so
clear cut then.
GUINAN: Because I wouldn't have anything to say.
LAFORGE: Then why don't you just listen? That is what you do best,
isn't it?
