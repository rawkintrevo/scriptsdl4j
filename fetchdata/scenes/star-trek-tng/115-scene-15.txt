[Picard's quarters]

(Crusher enters bearing a flask. Picard is in bed,
bare-chested) 
PICARD: Come. 
CRUSHER: It looks horrible, tastes worse, and it's absolutely
guaranteed to make you feel better. 
(He drinks) 
CRUSHER: I knew you'd like it. Are you wearing cologne? Like something
I smelled earlier. Something Klingon.
PICARD: Lieutenant Worf and I detected the same scent when we bumped
into your son at the Holodeck. 
CRUSHER: It's that smell. That's how the virus travels. An airborne
particle whose sweet scent inspires deep inhalation. And once inside
the body, it becomes that damned virus. I have work to do. 
(Crusher leaves) 
PICARD: You are excused, Doctor. 
[Great hall]

RIKER: What's the latest on the Enterprise's
medical situation? 
DATA: Doctor Crusher feels the virus will undoubtedly run unchecked
through the entire ship. Attempts to develop an inoculants have so far
ended in failure. Lieutenant La Forge still has Bridge command pending
your return, sir. 
RIKER: And what about the Romulans entering the Neutral Zone? 
DATA: The border outpost reports a contingent of seven Romulan
battlecruisers within sensor range. The USS Berlin has answered the
distress call. However, should hostilities erupt, both the outpost and
the starship will be out-gunned. It is felt that the Enterprise's
presence in the area will be a vital show of force. 
TASHA: Some show of force. The Enterprise could fly on autopilot, but
with that virus knocking down our crew, we're going to be in sorry
shape if things turn ugly. 
RIKER: I think it's time we to leave this place. 
TROI: It doesn't feel right to leave while Beata is determined to
execute those people. 
RIKER: She has to find them first. Ramsey and his bunch have been
fugitives for years. I suspect he's pretty good at evading capture. 
TROI: Something's wrong. 
(Beata enters, with Trent) 
BEATA: Before you go back to your ship, there's something I want you to
see. 
(Ramsey and his group are brought in) 
GUEST0: We were no harm to anyone. Why did you tell them where to find
us? 
BEATA: You brought this upon yourself. You and the traitor. One does
not need the technology of the Enterprise to follow Mistress Ariel
sneaking out to warn her husband. Let her stand with him now. For
tomorrow they will die together.
