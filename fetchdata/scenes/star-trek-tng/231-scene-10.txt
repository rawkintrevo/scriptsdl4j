TROI: Well, you all remember a table, so let's
start with that. Computer show me a table. 
COMPUTER: There are five thousand forty seven classifications of tables
on file. Specify design parameters. 
TROI: Can you be more specific about the table? You mentioned it was
smooth and cold. Can you remember what shape it was? 
GUEST2: Long. It was long. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, and it had a rectangular shape. 
TROI: Computer, show me a rectangular conference table. 
LAFORGE: It's too high. Computer, reduce the height of the table by
twenty five percent. 
WORF: No, the table was smaller. And it was inclined. Computer,
decrease the table's surface area by twenty percent and incline the top
fifteen degrees. 
RIKER: No, it wasn't made of wood. It was smoother, more metallic. 
TROI: Computer, make this a metal table. 
(a sort of operating table appears) 
LAFORGE: Yeah, that's starting to look right. 
TROI: Was there anything else in the room? Furniture? Chairs? A door?
Other people? 
GUEST2: No, it was dark. 
RIKER: Yes, it was dark. I couldn't see beyond the table. 
TROI: Computer, lower the surrounding light level. 
LAFORGE: There was a light right in my face. A bright light. Computer,
give me a bright light right above the table. 
COMPUTER: Specify light source. 
LAFORGE: I couldn't tell. It was above me. An overhead lamp. 
COMPUTER: Estimated distance of light source. 
LAFORGE: I don't know. It was at least two or three metres above.
Brighter. Brighter. 
TROI: You said you were uneasy when you sat down at the conn. position.

RIKER: Yes. I felt trapped by the console. But it wasn't like this.
There was something else here. 
TROI: A restraint of some kind? 
RIKER: Yes, there was a restraint. It was flat and metal. It was made
of metal. it came down over my legs. No, no, it was across my chest,
right here. 
TROI: It was holding you down? 
RIKER: Yes, it was part of the table. It was here. It was right here. 
TROI: Computer, create a restraining arm attached to the right side of
the table, at the mid-point. 
TROI: Was it like that? 
RIKER: Computer, put controls on the restraining arm. A control panel.
Lights. 
GUEST2: There was something else there. Over the head of the table. A
metal swing arm. Computer, create a metal swing arm, double jointed,
total length one metre. Connect it to the head of the table. 
WORF: There was something attached to it. A tool of some sort.
Scissor-like. Computer, produce a pair of scissors attached to the
armature. The handle is wrong. It was not scissors. Computer, make the
handle a single grip ten centimetres long, solid metal. Now make one
blade longer, curved inward. And give the other blade a jagged edge. 
TROI: All right, you were lying on the table. You had a bright light
shining in your eyes. Were there any smells in the room? Were there any
sounds? 
RIKER: Yes. Yes, there was a sound. Computer, there were noises coming
from the darkness. Strange, like whispering. 
GUEST2: More like clicks. Clicking sounds. 
RIKER: Louder. Faster. More of them. 
LAFORGE: I've been in this room before. 
RIKER: We've all been here before.
