RIKER LAFORGE WORF CREWMAN DATA ENGINEER

[Corridor]

(everyone strolls along calmly) 
DATA: The field imbalance has subsided. 
WORF: There may still be a residual discharge. Stand clear.

[Cargo bay]

ENGINEER: Is there something wrong, sir?

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: And there's no evidence of an EPS
explosion. 
RIKER: Sensors seemed to think there was. 
LAFORGE: I think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a
pattern recognition failure. 
RIKER: Just a sensor glitch? 
LAFORGE: That's my guess. 
RIKER: Let's perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor
network and make sure that we haven't overlooked anything. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start?
Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours.
I'm having trouble waking up. 
LAFORGE: Sure, Commander. Goodnight. 
RIKER: Goodnight.

[Riker's quarters]

(Riker drinks his prescription toddy, and lies
down) 
[Corridor]

CREWMAN: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Gordon. 
(Geordi rings a doorbell)

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Who is it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: It's La Forge. 
RIKER: Come in. LAFORGE: Good morning. 
RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. 
LAFORGE: Commander, it's oh seven hundred hours.
