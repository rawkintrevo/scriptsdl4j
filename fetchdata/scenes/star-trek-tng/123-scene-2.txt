PICARD: Intense magnetic fields have a disruptive
effect on electrical systems. Therefore we can expect communications
interruptions, as well as potential temporary loss of other systems. As
a precaution, we are now going to Yellow Alert. Stay sharp, everyone.

[Engineering]

COMPUTER: Attention all decks. Yellow Alert. 
DATA [OC]: Engineering, this is Lieutenant Commander Data. Bring all
systems online and direct full power to the shields.

DATA: All sections secure, sir. 
PICARD: Lieutenant La Forge? 
LAFORGE: Course is set, Captain. 
PICARD: Half impulse. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir, one half impulse. 
PICARD: On main viewer. Mask out the photosphere. Magnify. Quadrant one
seven, magnification factor twelve. 
RIKER: I've never seen anything like this before. The violence of these
eruptions is awesome. 
DATA: Captain, I'm reading an unusual number of sunspots and eruptive
prominences, sir. The magnetic field is extremely irregular. 
WESLEY: Captain, deflectors are being hit by a huge burst of X-rays. 
(The science station lights up with blue static and he steps away) 
WESLEY: Wow! Look. Captain, my console seems to be overloading. 
WORF: The X-ray burst is disrupting systems, Captain. I'm adjusting
deflectors to compensate.
