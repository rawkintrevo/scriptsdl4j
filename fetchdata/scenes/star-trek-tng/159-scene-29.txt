O'BRIEN: What the hell? 
(The brig is empty. Roga Danar has gone)

RIKER: Security personnel, full alert. Shut down
all shuttlebays, transporters, and turbolifts. 
WORF [OC]: Captain, a phaser is missing.

[Brig]

WORF: We must assume that he is armed.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Sound general quarters. Clear corridors of
all non-essential personnel. I don't want him taking any hostages. 
DATA: General quarters sounded, sir. 
PICARD: Raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirty
four, thirty five, and thirty six. 
SECURITY [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Data, put the turbolifts back online. If Danar sees they're
operating, he may try to use them. Soon as he does, we have him.

ducks into a turbolift - 12 on the door)

DATA: Sir, unauthorised access of turbolift five on
deck thirty four. 
RIKER: He took the bait. 
PICARD: Data, override its destination. Divert that turbolift to a
position near Lieutenant Worf's present location.
