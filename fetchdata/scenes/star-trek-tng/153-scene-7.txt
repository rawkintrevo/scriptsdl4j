PICARD RIKER TROI WESLEY

[Corridor]

PICARD: Picard to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Assign Commander La Forge to lead another away team to the dig
site. I want to know why this happened. 
RIKER [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: I will be with Counsellor Troi

[Bridge]

PICARD [OC]: And young Jeremy Aster. 
RIKER: I understand. Riker out. 
WESLEY: He had to do the same thing for me. 
RIKER: Do you know Jeremy well? 
WESLEY: But I know this is going to be like for him. 
RIKER: That's part of life in Starfleet, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I know. They're very careful to prepare us for anything, but
still 
RIKER: I know. 
WESLEY: How do you get used to it? Telling them? 
RIKER: You hope you never do.

TROI: I sense the weight of this duty on you,
Captain. 
PICARD: I really wonder. Halt. I've always believed that carrying
children on a starship is a very questionable policy.
Serving on a starship means accepting certain risks, certain dangers.
Did Jeremy Aster make that choice? 
TROI: Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere. Leaving
him on Earth would not have protected him. 
PICARD: No, but Earth isn't likely to be ordered to the Neutral Zone,
or to repel a Romulan attack, It was my command which sent his mother
to her death. She understood her mission and my duty. Will he? 
TROI: In time, and with help. Wesley Crusher does. He does. And so will
Jeremy. 
PICARD: Resume.
