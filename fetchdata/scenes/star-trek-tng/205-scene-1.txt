O'BRIEN: If it's a boy, Michael, after my father. 
KEIKO: Wait a minute. We decided on Hiro, after my father. 
O'BRIEN: We talked about this last night. 
KEIKO: That's right, and we decided on Hiro. 
RIKER: Wait. I've got it. William. It's a great name. William O'Brien.
It's got a nice ring to it. 
KEIKO: It's all right. He's just doing somersaults. Here, feel. 
(She puts Riker's hand on her bump) 
KEIKO: Right there. 
RIKER: He's going to be a hell of a gymnast. 
DATA: May I? 
KEIKO: Sure. There, feel it? When he's not turning, he's kicking and
punching. When I want to sleep, he wants to wake up. At this point, I
just wish it were over. 
O'BRIEN: I have to go. I've got a transporter simulation on the bridge.
Bye-bye, Michael.

you, you will be terrific. 
LAFORGE: All right. (sings) I am the very model of a modern major
general, I've information vegetable, animal and mineral. I can't do
this. 
CRUSHER: Yes you can! 
LAFORGE: I cannot sing in front of people. 
CRUSHER: You were terrific! You were a little off pitch, but I think I
can take care of that. Okay, La Forge as a modern major general.
