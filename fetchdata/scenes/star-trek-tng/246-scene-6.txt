DATA: At our present speed, we will arrive at the
Atalia system in thirty seven hours. 
TROI: Captain, I'm going for a walk in the arboretum. I wouldn't mind
some company. 
WORF: Captain, a distress call from Professor Galen's shuttle. On
screen. 
GALEN [on viewscreen]: Enterprise! I'm being boarded. 
WORF: Transmission has been blocked. 
DATA: I have located the shuttle. It is under attack. 
PICARD: Take us out of warp. On screen. 
WORF: A Yridian destroyer. 
RIKER: Battle stations. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Professor Galen is still inside his vessel, sir. His vital signs
are barely registering. 
PICARD: Get him out of there. 
WORF: The shuttle is enveloped by a tractor beam. The transporter
cannot penetrate it. 
RIKER: Hail the Yridians. 
WORF: They are not responding. 
(the Enterprise rocks under weapons fire) 
PICARD: Return phaser fire. Disable their offensive systems. 
(but instead, the big ship goes KaBOOM!) 
RIKER: Worf! 
WORF: I don't understand, Commander. The phaser blast was not powerful
enough to destroy the ship. 
PICARD: Transporter Room One, lock on to Professor Galen and transport
him directly to Sickbay. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: He took a disruptor hit point blank. There
is nothing I can do. 
(the life-signs monitor starts to flat-line) 
GALEN: Jean-Luc, I was too harsh.
