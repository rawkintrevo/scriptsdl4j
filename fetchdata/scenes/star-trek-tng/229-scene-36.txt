CRUSHER: Computer, make a note. Death occurred at fourteen thirty hours
from respiratory and renal failure.
ALKAR: Will you wait for me in my quarters?
LIVA: Of course.
(Liva leaves) 
ALKAR: It's a tragic loss, but her death had a purpose.
PICARD: I intend to make certain that you answer for what you have done.
ALKAR: Your own Federation Council has granted me safe and timely
passage back to my planet. I expect you to honour that, Captain.

RIKER: How much longer do we have?
CRUSHER: Three minutes and forty seconds.

CHIEF [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I want you to station yourself outside her
quarters.
WORF: Aye, sir.

[Alkar's quarters]

ALKAR: She helped me so much. Without her, I
couldn't have accomplished what I did.
LIVA: I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
ALKAR: Yes, there is something. If we could share the funeral
meditation.
