PICARD ROBERT MARIE COMPUTER WESLEY

[Chez Picard]

(There's mud, and muddy boots, on the carpet, and
drunken voices singing 'Aupres de ma blonde, qu'il fait bon, fait bon,
fait bon' dum, dum, dum. Marie enters from outside) 
MARIE: What in the world? What happened here? 
ROBERT: Ah 
PICARD: It's entirely my fault, Marie. 
ROBERT: Yes, I fell down, then he fell and then 
PICARD: We both fell down. 
ROBERT: We both fell down. 
PICARD: Together. 
ROBERT: We both fell down together. 
MARIE: Have you two been fighting? 
ROBERT: Fighting? No, certainly not. 
MARIE: Shame on you both. What would your father say if he saw you like
this? 
PICARD: He'd probably send us both to bed without our supper. 
MARIE: Well, perhaps it's just as well you got it out of your systems. 
PICARD: Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps it was. I'll contact Louis and
cancel the meeting with the Board of Governors. It's time that I was
going. 
MARIE: Already, Jean-Luc? 
PICARD: The ship will be ready to leave orbit soon, and I belong on
board. If I should ever doubt that again, I know where to come.
