PICARD: Report, Mister La Forge.

[Cargo deck five]

LAFORGE: Captain, we've checked everything. There's
no reason for this to be happening. I can't even isolate the cause of
the problem. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Come on Data, we'd better get down there. 
PICARD: Doctor Pulaski. 
PULASKI [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: We're having a little difficulty on cargo deck five. Your
presence is requested. 
PULASKI [OC]: I'm on my way.

[Ten forward]

(at the bar) 
WESLEY: You never talk about yourself. 
GUINAN: Sure I do. All the time. 
WESLEY: People say you're very old. 
GUINAN: Oh? 
WESLEY: And that you knew Captain Picard when he was on the Stargazer. 
GUINAN: No, I never knew the Captain till I came onboard. 
WESLEY: Everyone's very curious about you. 
GUINAN: Yes, I'll bet they are. 
WESLEY: They want to know where you're from. 
GUINAN: Where do they say? 
WESLEY: I heard that you're from Nova Kron and that 
PICARD [OC]: Mister Crusher, report to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Got to go. Thanks. 
GUINAN: For a dish of Delovian souffl? 
WESLEY: No, not for the souffl. I meant, for the rest. 
GUINAN: That's why I'm here. 
WESLEY: Thanks. Bye. 
[Cargo deck five]

RIKER: Why this module and not the others? 
DATA: Computer, run diagnostic on module L seven three. 
COMPUTER: (male) All circuits functional. 
LAFORGE: Environment's as programmed. Temperature ninety seven degrees
Kelvin. Radiation flux zero. Stasis field nominal. Everything exactly
as it should be, right down the line. 
DATA: Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction. Computer, inquiry. Is growth
actually occurring in module L seven three? 
COMPUTER: Confirmed. 
(Pulaski enters) 
RIKER: Doctor, one of the specimens is growing. 
PULASKI: Destroy it now. 
DEALT: I can't. 
RIKER: Data, prepare to jettison the module. 
DEALT: We can't do that either. It will go into a spore and remain
until it comes in contact with a planet or another ship. The results
would be disastrous. 
RIKER: Commander, your attitude tells me that however bad I think it
is, it's actually worse. 
DEALT: This is not going to hold it. 
RIKER: Go on. 
DEALT: The rate of growth is increasing so rapidly, within thirty
minutes it's going to push out of it's module. Within two hours, it'll
break out of the containment area. 
LAFORGE: No, no, no. It can't break through this. 
DEALT: Yes, it will. 
RIKER: Captain, we may not be able to get control of this situation. I
recommend we arrange transfer of all non-essential personnel to the
saucer section. 
[Bridge]

RIKER [OC]: If we lose containment, we should be
prepared to separate. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
[Cargo deck five]

PULASKI: Why this one specimen and none of the
others? Something is stimulating it. Do you have its etiology? Do you
know how it was developed? 
DEALT: Yes, it's right over here. 
PULASKI: It's a mutated strain developed by Doctor Susan Nuress during
an outbreak of plasma plague seventy years ago in the Oby System. It
was number nine in a series of fifty eight tests. This particular one
bombarded by low levels of Eichner radiation. Could exposure to Eichner
radiation stimulate growth? 
DEALT: It could, but I. I've got something. 
RIKER: Why didn't you detect this before? 
DEALT: I don't know. It wasn't here before. 
PULASKI: Well, it is now. What emits that type of radiation? 
DATA: A subspace phase inverter. 
LAFORGE: We don't have one. 
DATA: Certain cyanoacrylates. 
PULASKI: Also not on this ship. What else? Because it's here and we
better find it.
