SUSANNA: That's Hickman on the right, Mendez on the left, and as
already noted, the recording was made by Ensign Brevelle five years
ago. 
PICARD: Commander Leijten, you said that before Brevelle deserted
Starbase one one two last week, he'd been ill for several days. What
about Mendez? 
SUSANNA: Mendez was seen on the Aries an hour before she disappeared.
According to witnesses, she seemed completely normal. 
RIKER: And Hickman? 
SUSANNA: He just passed a routine physical on Alia Four with flying
colours. 
LAFORGE: No, wait, I know Paul Hickman. He's a family man, he's got two
kids. He wouldn't steal a shuttle and desert. 
SUSANNA: Geordi, he was spotted by a Federation supply ship yesterday,
on course to Tarchannen three. 
PICARD: The original Tarchannen disappearances were never solved, were
they? 
SUSANNA: No, we never learned what happened or why. Forty nine people
gone. 
RIKER: And five years later, the away team that was investigating their
disappearances have started to disappear themselves. 
SUSANNA: Geordi and I are the only two left.

Captain's log, stardate 44664.5. We've set a course
to intercept Lieutenant Hickman's stolen shuttlecraft, and, hopefully,
to discover the whereabouts of the other missing officers.

SUSANNA: And then I almost married Paul Bogrow. 
LAFORGE: Bogrow? Bogrow, now which one was he? 
SUSANNA: You remember. The one with the thin moustache. 
LAFORGE: Oh, not Bogrow. 
SUSANNA: I know. 
LAFORGE: The one who always used to drive you crazy? You always thought
he was so full of himself. 
SUSANNA: Well, I decided I had prejudged him unfairly. And then I
decided that I'd been right in the first place. 
LAFORGE: Bogrow. 
SUSANNA: What about you? 
LAFORGE: I enjoy the bachelor's life too much. 
SUSANNA: That doesn't sound like my little brother who always wanted
advice on women. 
LAFORGE: Well, obviously you were a great advisor. (pause) Well, Suz,
what do you think? 
SUSANNA: I don't know. But I'm not ashamed to tell you I'm a little
scared, you know? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I know. 
SUSANNA: Well, if anybody's going to figure this out, it'll be the
Leitjen and La Forge Show, right? 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
SUSANNA: We always made a good team. 
LAFORGE: A hell of a team. 
RIKER [OC]: Commander La Forge, Commander Leijten, report to the
Bridge. We have a fix on the missing shuttle. 
LAFORGE: On our way, Commander.
