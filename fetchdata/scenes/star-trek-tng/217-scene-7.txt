RIKER WORF TROI SOREN CRUSHER DATA

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: It's just a mild concussion. You're going
to be fine. This will reduce the inflammation. 
SOREN: Doctor, you are female. 
CRUSHER: Yes. 
SOREN: Forgive me, I do not mean to be rude, but I'm curious. What is
it like? 
CRUSHER: Well, it's just the way I am. I've never really thought about
what it's like. 
SOREN: I've noticed you tend to have longer hair, and you arrange it
more elaborately. And you apply colour to your bodies. 
CRUSHER: Colour? 
SOREN: You put colour on your mouths, and your eyes, your cheeks, your
fingernails. The men don't. 
CRUSHER: That's true. 
SOREN: Then it is up to women to attract the men. 
CRUSHER: Oh, no. Men want to be attractive too, believe me. They just
go about it differently. 
SOREN: No colour. 
CRUSHER: No colour. They like to pretend they're not doing anything to
attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their
minds. 
SOREN: This is very confusing. Then, are women considered more
superior, or are men? 
CRUSHER: Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and
inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time. 
(Riker enters) 
CRUSHER: Will, your co-pilot is going to be fine. The injury was minor.

RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. 
SOREN: I'm afraid you're not rid of me yet, Commander. I will be able
to complete the mission. 
RIKER: Glad you feel better. 
SOREN: What happened? What made the shuttle go into a spin? 
RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from
the null pocket and shut it down. 
SOREN: Are we still on schedule, then? 
RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. 
SOREN: I'm fine. We should go check the port engine. 
RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. 
SOREN: Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I don't see any problem. But if you feel any symptoms,
headache, dizziness, come back. 
SOREN: You have my word.

[Data's quarters]

(I'm assuming that from the deerstalker and cape on
the hat stand behind Worf) 
TROI: All right. This hand, the game is Federation Day. 
WORF: What is that? 
TROI: Well, the Federation was founded in Twenty One Sixty One, so,
twos, sixes, and aces are wild. 
WORF: That is a woman's game. 
TROI: Oh? Why is that? 
WORF: All those wild cards. They support a weak hand. A man's game has
no wild cards. 
CRUSHER: Let me get this straight. Are you saying it's a woman's game
because women are weak and need more help? 
WORF: Yes. 
CRUSHER: And just this afternoon I was insisting to one of the J'naii
that those attitudes were but a distant memory. 
WORF: The J'naii. They bother me. 
TROI: Why, Worf? 
WORF: They just do. They're all alike. No males, no females. 
TROI: Well I'm sure we're just as strange to them. 
CRUSHER: Well one of them seems to be overcoming the differences, at
least in regards to one of us. 
WORF: What are you saying, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: I could be wrong, but I get the definite impression that Soren
is attracted to Commander Riker. 
WORF: A human and a J'naii? Impossible. 
DATA: Why? 
TROI: Good question. Worf? 
WORF: With all these wild cards, it is difficult to know exactly what
is in my hand. However, I will open with fifty.
