HOBSON: You've got to keep this mixture above
ninety percent or we'll never leave orbit. Thank you, Mister Krags. 
(Data enters) 
DATA: I am Lieutenant Commander Data. 
HOBSON: Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hobson. 
DATA: By order of Starfleet, I hereby take command of this vessel.
Please note the time and date in the ship's log. 
HOBSON: Excuse me, sir. I'd like to request a transfer. 
DATA: May I ask why? 
HOBSON: I don't believe I'd be a good first officer for you. 
DATA: Your service record to date suggests that you would perform that
function adequately. 
HOBSON: No, no, no, that's not what I mean. I don't think that I would
be a good first officer for you. 
DATA: Why? 
HOBSON: Frankly, sir, I don't believe in your ability to command this
ship. You're a fellow officer and I respect that, but no one would
suggest that a Klingon would make a good ship's counsellor or that a
Berellian could be an engineer. They're just not suited for those
positions. By the same token, I don't think an android is a good choice
to be captain. 
DATA: I understand your concerns. Request denied.

O'BRIEN: (at tactical) The Endeavour has cleared
the dock, Captain. All ships standing by. 
PICARD: Good. Course one one eight mark three five seven, full impulse
power. Signal the fleet to get underway. We'll enter warp once we're
clear of the system. 
O'BRIEN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Engage.
