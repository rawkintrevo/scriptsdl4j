(O'Brien beams a young woman and her older
chaperone aboard. No luggage) 
PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. 
ANYA: This is Salia of Daled Four. 
SALIA: I didn't feel a thing. Is that normal when one is transported,
Captain? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, it is. 
SALIA: Those must be the matter energy conversion controls. May I take
a look? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. 
RIKER: I can arrange for a tour of the ship, if you'd like. 
SALIA: Oh, I'd love that. 
ANYA: No, that will not be necessary. Just show us to our quarters,
Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Very well.

[Corridor]

PICARD: We're accommodating you in quarters
normally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find them
quite comfortable. 
(Wesley exits a turbolift as the party passes. The universe stands
still as Salia smiles at him, then turns back to speak) 
SALIA: That's a superconducting magnet, isn't it? 
WESLEY: Yes It's an SCM model. How did you know that? 
SALIA: Study, for the last sixteen years it is all I could 
ANYA: Please, Salia, walk ahead with me. 
SALIA: Better be careful. Those can rip the iron right out of your
blood cells. 
(The party moves on, minus Riker) 
WESLEY: Commander, who is she? 
RIKER: I think she's a governess. 
WESLEY: No! The girl. 
RIKER: I don't know if she'll have time for you, Wes. She's destined to
rule an entire world.

[Wesley's quarters]

(Wesley is preening in front of a full length
mirror) 
WESLEY: Come in. 
DATA: You wanted to see me? 
WESLEY: Yes. Data, the girl who came on board. 
DATA: Salia of Daled Four. 
WESLEY: Who is she? 
DATA: Little is known. She was born on Daled Four. Her parents were
from opposite sides in a civil war which has lasted for centuries. They
both died shortly after her birth. A Federation ship brought her and
her governess to Klavdia Three so that she could be raised in a neutral
environment. 
WESLEY: And now she's returning? 
DATA: It is hoped she will unite the factions and bring peace. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Ensign Crusher, report. Are you all right? 
WESLEY: Geordi? Yeah, I'm fine. I just 
LAFORGE [OC]: Wes, we're waiting for that magnet. 
WESLEY: I'm on my way. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Captain, we've broken orbit and laid in a
course for Daled Four. We will remain on impulse power until Lieutenant
La Forge completes his adjustments. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, have our passenger's accommodations met with their
approval? 
WORF: I doubt if anything ever meets with that woman's approval, sir. 
TROI: Captain, I'm concerned our new passengers. Their emotions do not
fit who they are and what they're doing. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting they're not who they say they are? 
TROI: Actually no, it's more like they're not what they say they are. 
PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. 
SALIA [OC]: Yes? 
PICARD: May we turn on the viewer? 
SALIA [OC]: Yes, of course.
PICARD: Are your quarters satisfactory? 
SALIA [on viewscreen]: Yes, very. Tell me, Captain, who was the young
man I met before? 
[Salia's quarters]

PICARD [on monitor]: That was Ensign Wesley
Crusher. 
(Anya enters) 
SALIA: Thank you for checking on us, Captain. I only hope our quarters
on Daled Four will be this luxurious. 
PICARD [on monitor]: Please feel free to contact me at any time. Picard
out.
