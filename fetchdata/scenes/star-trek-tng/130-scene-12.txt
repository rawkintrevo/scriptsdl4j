[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Okona. 
OKONA: Captain, I've decided not to leave. 
PICARD: Oh. 
OKONA: Don't worry, I'm not staying either. 
PICARD: Just what are your plans, Mister Okona? 
OKONA: I've decided to surrender myself. 
RIKER: To which one? 
OKONA: There's really only one option. 
PICARD: Viewer on. Gentlemen, communicating like this is very
distracting. I suggest that we beam you up to the Enterprise and we
resolve this face to face. 
GUEST1 [on viewscreen]: Excellent. 
GUEST4 [on viewscreen]: Agreed. 
RIKER: Leave your weapons behind. Let's keep this civilised. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. Counsellor Troi, would you
accompany me to deck fourteen conference room. Worf, see to our guests.

WORF: Aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]

(The fathers and children are beamed aboard
together) 
GUEST0: They have no weapons. 
WORF: This way. 
[Conference room]

(No big table, just a few comfortable chairs
scattered around) 
GUEST4: Okona, you are without shame. 
GUEST1: For once I agree with Debin. You are without shame. I trusted
you. My son treated you like a brother. And then to steal from us. I
want him now. 
GUEST4: No, he's coming with me. Captain, my complaint was registered
first. 
PICARD: Now please, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. 
(Worf leaves) 
OKONA: Everyone is talking about me, and no one's talking to me. You
all believe that I stole the jewel, and that it was I who fathered the
child. 
GUEST4: You dare call my daughter a liar? 
OKONA: And now I'm offered these two choices, and given these two
options, condemnation as a thief or marriage to the beautiful Yanar. I
will take the more pleasant sentence. I will take Yanar as my wife. 
GUEST2: No! You can't! 
GUEST1: My son is right. You can't escape that way. 
GUEST2: That's not what I mean. 
GUEST4: It's not up to you, or to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will
decide. 
GUEST3: Wait. Since all of you believe Okona is the father of this
child, then so be it. I'll marry you. 
GUEST2: No! You can't. 
GUEST3: Yes, I can. 
GUEST1: Okona is still a thief. 
GUEST2: No, he's not. Nothing has been stolen. The Jewel of Thesia has
been taken into custody by its rightful heir. Me. I was to give it to
Yanar as our pledge of marriage. 
GUEST1: Marriage? 
GUEST2: Yanar is carrying my child. 
GUEST4: You said it was Okona's. 
GUEST3: If I'd told you it was Benzan you would have gone to war with
his father. So I let you believe it was Okona. 
OKONA: See how a man gets a reputation? 
GUEST2: If I had told you I was giving the Jewel to Debin's daughter,
you'd have disowned me. 
TROI: Now we're hearing some truth. 
GUEST1: So you let me chase Okona when you knew he was innocent. 
GUEST2: Yes, because I didn't believe for one moment that you could
catch him. 
OKONA: Well, said. He never would have. 
GUEST2: And once Yanar accepted the Jewel the marriage would have been
made. 
GUEST3: Well, I never got it. 
GUEST1: Then Okona does have the jewel. 
OKONA: I never had the chance to deliver it.
GUEST3: Anyway it's too late. I won't marry Benzan. 
GUEST4: Then you'll marry Okona. 
GUEST3: I won't marry anyone!
