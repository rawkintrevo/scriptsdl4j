right confirm picard consistent scan oc maybe aft structure

[Shuttlebay]

DATA: Computer, scan the shuttle's structural
integrity. 
COMPUTER: Sub-microscopic deformations are present in the nose section
and aft thrusters. 
DATA: Probable cause of these variations? 
COMPUTER: The shuttle has been subjected to stress consistent with a
tractor beam.

(Geordi enters and watches Picard with the
Klingons) 
PICARD: All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in the
structural alloys which allows us to trace our material. 
(Geordi reaches for his phaser) 
O'BRIEN: Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: What can I do for you, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: Could you take a look at the pattern buffers? Considering
what's happened, I'm not sure the control systems are reliable. 
LAFORGE: Sure. Sure, let's take a look.

DATA: Computer, I am reading anomalous variations
in the molecular structure of these memory chips. Please confirm. 
COMPUTER: Analysis confirmed. 
DATA: Probable cause? 
COMPUTER: Replication. 
DATA: Compare these variations with established Romulan replication
patterns. 
COMPUTER: The patterns are identical.

LAFORGE: Maybe we should run a level one diagnostic
on those phase transition coils. 
O'BRIEN: Right, Commander. 
DATA [OC]: Data to La Forge.
