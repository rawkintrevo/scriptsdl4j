[Holodeck - Glade]

LAFORGE: Reg? 
(He comes upon a Gainsborough tableau - Beverly on a floral swing and
Wesley in blue, eating cake. There's a white parakeet in a cane cage
too) 
LAFORGE: Beverly? 
CRUSHER: Good morning, my lord. Manners, my son. Manners. You embarrass
me before our guest. Master Barclay will spank you if you misbehave. 
LAFORGE: Wesley ? 
WESLEY: What do you want? 
LAFORGE: Well, I guess I want Master Barclay. 
CRUSHER: The boys got into another little scrap, I'm afraid. But boys
will be boys. 
(A swordfight enters, with much clashing of swords. three musketeers
versus Barclay) 
LAFORGE: You cannot withstand our assault forever, Barclay. 
DATA: You are outnumbered, Mister Barclay. Say you will yield and it
ends here. 
BARCLAY: I will speak with my sword, sir. 
PICARD: In God's name, where did you learn to fight like this, man? 
BARCLAY: Self taught, my capitaine. Shall I give you a few lessons? 
(Naturally, Barclay is completely victorious) 
PICARD: Who is that? One of your allies? 
BARCLAY: Jean-Luc. Not that old trick. I'm very disappointed in you. 
(Geordi coughs, Reg turns, and the bottom falls out of his world) 
[Ten Forward]

BARCLAY: I'll make it easy for you, Commander. I'll
request reassignment. 
LAFORGE: Now, wait a minute. 
BARCLAY: Look, we both know, the whole ship knows, I just can't cut it
here. 
LAFORGE: Hey, Barclay, I've spent a few hours on the holodeck too, you
know. Now, as far as I'm concerned what you do in the holodeck is your
own business, as long as it doesn't interfere with your work. 
BARCLAY: You're, you're not going to tell anyone about this? 
LAFORGE: I don't think everybody would appreciate your imagination like
I do. It is kind of unusual, recreating people you already know. 
BARCLAY: well, it was just. I needed to blow off some steam because
one, one of the officers had been getting on my back. 
LAFORGE: Let me guess. 
BARCLAY: It was you, and I just couldn't tell you what I wanted to tell
you to your face, so it just sort of got out of control. 
LAFORGE: I don't know. There's a part of this that's kind of
therapeutic. Maybe you ought to talk to Counsellor Troi about it. 
BARCLAY: It's, it's, I, when I'm in there I'm just more comfortable.
You don't know what a struggle this has been for me, Commander. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to help, if I can. 
BARCLAY: Being afraid all the time, of forgetting somebody's name, not
knowing what to do with your hands. I mean, I'm the guy who writes down
things to remember to say when there's a party. And then when he
finally get there, he winds up alone in the corner trying to look
comfortable examining a potted plant. 
LAFORGE: You're just shy, Barclay. 
BARCLAY: Just shy. Sounds like nothing serious, doesn't it? You can't
know. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: O'Brien to La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Go ahead. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: I need you in transporter room three,
Commander.
