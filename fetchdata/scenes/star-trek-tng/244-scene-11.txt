(Picard drags the unconscious Devor into the room
and starts rifling through drawers.) 
KELSEY [OC]: Kelsey to Devor. Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply. Devor, do
you read me? Kelsey to Kiros. 
KIROS [OC]: This is Kiros. 
KELSEY [OC]: Devor isn't responding. There must be too much
interference from the baryon sweep. Go find him and see if he finished
by passing the regulator on deck seven, then meet us in main
Engineering. 
KIROS [OC]: Understood. 
(Picard wakes Devor) 
PICARD: Hey. Hey. Who are you? What are you doing on my ship? 
DEVOR: The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency plasma field. Your phaser
won't work. 
PICARD: You're probably right. But I'd like to bet this will. A laser
welder can be deadly. What's going on in main Engineering? I suggest
that you cooperate. 
DEVOR: You're Starfleet. You won't kill me. 
PICARD: You sure? 
(Picard hypos him instead) 
PICARD: Seems you're right.

(Picard is caught trying to climb up. It's Patricia
Tallman in alien makeup as Kiros) 
[Arkaria base]

DATA: Yes, but Tyrellian laser art is very similar
in both form and composition. 
HUTCH: Of course. You know, funny you should mention that. I used to be
stationed on Tyrellia. 
DATA: Really? Did you know that there are currently five Tyrellians
serving aboard the Enterprise. 
HUTCH: That's fascinating. Not too many people know this, but Tyrellia
is one of only three known inhabited worlds without a magnetic pole. 
DATA: I was aware of that. But are you aware that Tyrellia is one of
seven known planets with no atmosphere whatsoever. 
HUTCH: Really? 
TROI: They're still at it. 
RIKER: Non-stop. I have to admit it has a certain strange fascination.
How long can two people talk about nothing? 
(Geordi is helping himself to the buffet when his visor picks up
something.) 
WAITER: Is something wrong? 
LAFORGE: I don't know. I was just getting some very strange energy
readings from your table here. 
WAITER: I'm sure it's nothing serious. Perhaps the heating element
under the table is malfunctioning. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I should take a look at it for you. 
ORTON: I'm sure we can handle this, whatever it is, Commander. There's
no need to concern yourself. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe I should look at the heating element. I mean, in
case it 
ORTON: It's all right. Please, don't worry. 
RIKER: What was all that about? 
ORTON: I assure you it's all right. We'll look into it. You don't have
to concern yourself. 
WAITER: Orton, now! 
(Orton knocks Geordi over. The waiter gets a rifle from under the table
and fires it at Geordi, hitting him square in the chest. Orton gets a
gun for himself.) 
HUTCH: What is going on? 
(Orton shoots him) 
ORTON: Stay right where you are.
