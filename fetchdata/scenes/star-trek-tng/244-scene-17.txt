PICARD KELSEY NEIL KIROS POMET

[Corridor]

(Satler's death scream reaches Picard as he walks
along) 
[Engineering]

NEIL: The primary inducer is completely fused.
There's no way to fix it. Without the diverter, we don't have any
protection from the baryon sweep. 
KELSEY: I know that. How long before the baryon sweep gets here? 
NEIL: About twelve minutes. We should go to Ten Forward. That's the
last place on the ship that'll be swept by the baryon field. 
KELSEY: All right, we're leaving. But we're taking the trilithium with
us. 
NEIL: What? Do you know how volatile trilithium is? We can't just start
hauling it through the ship. 
(Kelsey gives him a Look) 
NEIL: I'll, I'll try to make some modifications. 
POMET: Satler's dead. He ran into the baryon sweep. 
KELSEY: What about Mot? 
POMET: I don't know. But I don't think he's a barber. I found this in
the Jefferies Tube. 
(He hands over Picard's comm. badge)

[Worf's quarters]

(Picard uses his magnetic door opener to get in and
check out the weapons display. A conversation comes over Devor's
intercom) 
KELSEY [OC]: Kelsey to Kiros. 
KIROS [OC]: This is Kiros. 
KELSEY [OC]: We have a problem. There's a Starfleet officer still on
board. He's killed Satler and he may have killed Devor. He also
destroyed the diverter in Engineering so we have to leave here before
the baryon sweep enters this section. 
KIROS [OC]: What about the trilithium resin? 
KELSEY [OC]: We're taking it with us to Ten Forward. There should be
enough time before
PICARD: Kelsey. Don't be a fool.
