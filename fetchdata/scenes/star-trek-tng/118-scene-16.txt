RASHELLA PICARD RADUE CRUSHER WESLEY

[First Unit]

PICARD: Before we begin, we want to see the
children. 
RADUE: No. We're here to negotiate appropriate compensation, not to
pander to emotions. Please sit. 
PICARD: We do not condone your actions. You're attempting to salve your
conscience by offering goods in exchange for our children. 
RADUE: Why do you want them back so badly? You can always have more. 
PICARD: You are trifling with the primal instincts of our species. I
must warn you that human parents are quite willing to die for their
children. 
RADUE: Returning the children is non-negotiable. 
RASHELLA: I promise you, they'll have a beautiful life with us. And
they'll be father and mother to a new breed born of an ancient culture.

CRUSHER: But how can you be so sure that they can have children? You
can't. 
RADUE: But they will. Our inability to bear children is a genetic
dysfunction. It's not contagious. 
PICARD: We sympathise with your situation. Surely there is a solution
which can be mutually satisfactory? 
RADUE: For us, the problem is solved. And we're offering you
information on areas of the galaxy you do not even know exist. What
more can we offer? What more would you like? 
PICARD: A significant beginning. But first, I must ask that Doctor
Crusher be allowed to see her son before we continue. 
RADUE: You are a stubborn people. Ah, well, that too can be a positive
trait. You may see him.

[Wesley's room]

(Duana shows Beverly in) 
WESLEY: Mom! 
CRUSHER: Wes. 
(She activates her tricorder) 
WESLEY: I knew Captain Picard would get us home. 
CRUSHER: Not yet, Wes. 
(She gives him the hand scanner) 
WESLEY: Oh. 
CRUSHER: Are you okay? And the others? 
WESLEY: Okay, really okay. We've been assigned to our units, like
families. They're treating us like gods. 
(Meanwhile, he walks around Duana, scanning her) 
CRUSHER: Don't let it go to your head. 
WESLEY: I won't. 
[First Unit]

CRUSHER: Wes seems fine. He says the other children
are too. 
RASHELLA: Of course they're well. 
RADUE: Captain Picard, you have our offer. It is final. Rashella.
