[Salia's quarters]

(Salia is talking to another teenaged girl. Where
did she come from?) 
SALIA: How can I be a leader if I don't know anything about my people? 
GIRL: You will lead because you are accepted by both sides. And because
it is in your blood. 
SALIA: What is expected of me once I'm there? 
GIRL: You will know. 
SALIA: How? 
GIRL: You just will. Salia, you must arrive with an open mind, without
preconceived ideas of the worlds
you will find or the people on either side. 
SALIA: It's very frustrating. 
GIRL: You feel the weight of so much responsibility, you're not sure
you'll live up to everyone's expectations. 
SALIA: It's not only that. Nobody's even asked me if this is something
I want. 
GIRL: It is your duty. 
SALIA: And I have no choice. 
GIRL: It won't be as bad as you think. In fact, it could be quite
wonderful. Besides, you are the last and only chance. 
(The girl changes into a short, big-eyed, hairy creature that chatters
at her in alien) 
SALIA: Don't you think I'm going to need more than instinct to do
whatever is expected of me on Daled Four?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Energy depletion level? 
COMPUTER: (male) Point oh four percent and increasing. 
LAFORGE: Wesley? Wesley, you haven't found that defocused area yet? 
(Wesley is on the upper catwalk) 
WESLEY: I'm looking. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, I see the way you're looking. Wesley! 
WESLEY: What? (drops the equipment) Sorry. I've got my mind on
something. 
LAFORGE: I can see that. 
WESLEY: It's this girl they beamed up, Geordi. She's perfect.
Absolutely perfect. 
LAFORGE: Now I understand why you can't concentrate. 
WESLEY: I'll do better. 
LAFORGE: Okay. 
COMPUTER: Warning, resonant field applied. 
LAFORGE: What is it? What happened? 
WESLEY: Nothing. I had it on the wrong setting. 
LAFORGE: I suppose it had to happen to you. It usually does at about
this age. 
WESLEY: What usually does? 
LAFORGE: Glands erupting with hormones. It happens to all of us. 
WESLEY: Just because I said that I think she's interesting 
LAFORGE: You said she was perfect. Come on down. You're no use around
here for now. Come on down. Go talk to her. Use the ladder. 
(Wesley comes down to Geordi) 
WESLEY: That's silly, Geordi. But since you recommended it, how should
I approach her? If she'll talk to me, what should I say? 
LAFORGE: Just say, 'Hi, I'm Wesley Crusher. I'd like to talk to you'. 
WESLEY: And then what? 
LAFORGE: Whatever occurs to you. 
WESLEY: What if nothing occurs to me? 
LAFORGE: Look, Wes, I don't have time for this. You're going to have to
ask somebody else. 
WESLEY: Okay.

[Bridge]

(Worf is roaring) 
WORF: That is how the Klingon lures a mate. 
WESLEY: Are you telling me to go yell at Salia? 
WORF: No. Men do not roar. Women roar. Then they hurl heavy objects.
And claw at you. 
WESLEY: What does the man do? 
WORF: He reads love poetry. He ducks a lot. 
WESLEY: Worf, sounds like it works great for the Klingons, but I think
I need to try something a little less dangerous. 
WORF: Then go to her door. Beg like a human. 
DATA: It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance it is
likely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, there
could be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cell
membrane, but. 
WESLEY: Data, I want to meet her, not dissect her. 
(Wesley leaves as Picard enters) 
PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. 
SALIA [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: May I activate the viewer? 

[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Hurry, go, go. 
(The little furry creature runs out of the room) 
SALIA: Certainly. 
PICARD: (on monitor) We've invited Anya to take a tour of the ship.
Maybe you would like to join her? 
SALIA: Very much. 
PICARD: (on monitor) Your escort will with you shortly. Picard out. 
SALIA: I think I'll go on the tour. 
(The creature runs back in, chattering) 
SALIA: Why can't I? This is the only chance I'll ever have to see a
vessel like this. 
(The little creature morphs into Anya) 
ANYA: No. You must remain here where it is safe. Salia, do an old woman
a favour and obey me for the rest of this trip. 
SALIA: You are no more an old woman than I am a leader. 
(Doorbell) 
SALIA: Yes. Come in. 
WORF: I'm here to escort you on a tour of the Enterprise. 
ANYA: Salia will remain behind. I will be right there. You are a
leader. And I am older than you could ever imagine.

[Ten forward]

WESLEY: What should I say? How do I act? What do I
do? 
RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? 
GUINAN: Sounds simple enough. 
(They sit at a table) 
RIKER: (to Wesley) Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most
important. You may want to start with something like this. (Riker sits
opposite Guinan) You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. But
that might not work. 
GUINAN: Yes. Yes, it would. 
RIKER: You don't know how long I've longed to tell you that. 
GUINAN: But you were afraid? 
RIKER: Yes. 
GUINAN: Of me? 
RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. 
WESLEY: Commander? 
RIKER: or that you might think that was a line. 
GUINAN: Maybe I do think it's a line. 
RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? 
GUINAN: I didn't say that. There's nothing wrong with a line. It's like
a knock at the door. 
RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? 
GUINAN: I'm not sending you away. 
RIKER: That's more than I expected. 
GUINAN: Is it as much as you hoped? 
RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. 
GUINAN: Dreams can be dangerous. 
RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars,
and the universe worships the night. 
GUINAN: Careful. Putting me on a pedestal so high, you may not be able
to reach me. 
RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and the
soul in my night. 
WESLEY: I don't think this is my style. 
GUINAN: Shut up, kid. Tell me more about my eyes.
