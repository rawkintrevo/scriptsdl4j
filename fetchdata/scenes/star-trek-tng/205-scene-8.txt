[Ten Forward]

(the place is a wreck) 
RIKER: How do you feel? 
KEIKO: Okay. A little foggy. 
RIKER: Just lie still for a while. We'll get you to Sickbay as soon as
we can. 
KEIKO: Okay. 
RIKER: Report. 
DATA: I have surveyed all the turbolifts and service crawlways on this
deck. Access to the Bridge has been completely severed by emergency
bulkheads. 
WORF: Sickbay? 
DATA: Heavy damage to section twenty three A has cut off access to
Sickbay. I have ordered a security team to bring casualties here until
further notice. 
RIKER: I think we should assume the worst, that everyone on the Bridge
is dead. There's
no one is in control of the ship. 
DATA: In that circumstance, re-establishing control should be our top
priority. 
RIKER: Agreed. Can we get to Engineering? 
DATA: Yes, sir. The most direct route is blocked, but I believe we can
use a starboard service crawlway. 
RIKER: Okay, you and I will try to get there. Mister Worf, this room is
going to fill with wounded in a few minutes and they're going to need
help. I want you to stay in charge here. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: Let's go. 
(a man carries a woman in) 
WORF: Over here. 
CREWMAN: Yes, sir. 
[Cargo bay]

(it's a lot brighter in here)
LAFORGE: Okay. Clear the power shunt. 
CRUSHER: The shunt is cleared. 
LAFORGE: Right. And bypass the flow current, and (nothing). The
computer still won't release the doors. 
CRUSHER: Can we force them open? 
LAFORGE: Yes, we can try. There's an emergency hand actuator. 
CRUSHER: Geordi? 
LAFORGE: Yes? 
CRUSHER: This wall is hot. 
LAFORGE: Where? 
(then something blows out where he had removed a panel, knocking him
off his feet) 
LAFORGE: I'm all right, but I think we've got a new problem. One of the
energy conduits must've ruptured and ignited the polyduranide inside
the bulkhead. That's a plasma fire. 
(and it's green) 
CRUSHER: It's putting out a lot of radiation. We can't stay in here
very long. 
LAFORGE: We've got a bigger problem than that. The quaratum in these
containers is used in emergency thruster packs. It's normally pretty
stable stuff but when you expose quaratum to radiation, it has a way of
exploding.
