RIKER: The Bynars seem perfect for this. Even
though this is the first time I've ever come in contact with them. 
PICARD: As I understand it, over time they have become so
interconnected with the master computer on their planet that their
language, their thought patterns have become as close to binary as it's
possible for organic beings. 
RIKER: It'll be interesting to see how they improve a computer as
advanced as ours. 
[Turbolift]

PICARD: Bridge. Well, I have a little work to
finish up, then I'm going to my cabin. I'm going to put my feet up, I'm
going to turn on my personal relaxation light and I'm going to lose
myself in the pages of some old novel. What about you, Number One?
You've earned a rest. 
RIKER: I've never been very good at organising my time off.
Something'll turn up. It always does. 
[Bridge]

(There are four Bynars at a rear computer station.
Wesley is watching them as Riker and Picard enter) 
PICARD: I'll be in my ready room. And Number One, good work.

(They turn back to their work) 
WESLEY: You act like you don't believe them. 
RIKER: I'm not sure that I do. Maybe it's probably nothing. 
WESLEY: Perhaps it's just how another species behaves. 
RIKER: Maybe. I'm going to stroll the ship. You've got the Bridge. Keep
your eye on them. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir.
