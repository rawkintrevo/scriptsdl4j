TASHA PICARD RIKER CRUSHER SELAY

[Corridor]

(Someone uses a florescent green lasso on Riker) 
RIKER: What the hell? 
SELAY: Sorry. Wrong species. 
RIKER: Riker to Security Chief.

[Bridge]

TASHA: Yar here. 
RIKER [OC]: Security guard to the Engineering deck. 
[Corridor]

RIKER: Selays are playing hide and seek down here,
obviously with the Anticans. It's a lethal game. I want them returned
to their quarters under guard. 
TASHA [OC]: Right away, sir. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
(Crusher enters with a data chip) 
PICARD: What do you want? 
CRUSHER: Here are the results from the exams you ordered, sir. You
don't care to inspect them? Please, are you Jean-Luc? 
PICARD: He is here. 
CRUSHER: The Jean-Luc I know? 
PICARD: And more. 
CRUSHER: The more frightens me. 
PICARD: And elates us. We wish you could understand the glorious
adventure ahead. 
CRUSHER: You and? 
PICARD: Soon we'll both be home.

First officer's log, supplemental. On the orders of
Captain Picard, we have returned to the vicinity of the energy pattern
cloud. I am personally convinced that something from this cloud now
shares the Captain's mind. But there seems to be nothing we can do, at
least within regulations.
