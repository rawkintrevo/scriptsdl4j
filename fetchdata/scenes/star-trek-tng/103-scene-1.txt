RIKER WOMAN WORF TASHA PICARD DATA MAN

[Bridge]

(There is the sound of laughter coming over the
comm. system) 
DATA: SS Tsiolkovsky, repeat your message. 
WOMAN [OC]: Well hello, Enterprise. Welcome. I hope you have a lot of
pretty boys on board, because i'm willing and waiting. In fact, we're
going to have a real blow-out here. 
MAN [OC]: Do it! Yeah, go ahead. Do it! (BANG) 
DATA: Captain, what we just heard is impossible. 
PICARD: Report. 
DATA: I believe that last sound we heard was an emergency hatch being
blown. 
PICARD: Are you certain? Yes, of course you are. 
RIKER: Data, Geordi, Tasha.
WORF: Sensor scan now reveals no life signs aboard, Captain. 
(The Enterprise comes up to the ship in orbit) 

[Tsiolkovsky]

(The group beam into an area with scattered
furniture and a Red Alert) 
RIKER: Cover the ship as planned. Move out. 
DATA: Indications of what humans would call a wild party? 
(They find a monitor, with a static laden image) 
RIKER: Their Bridge. If this thing works, be sure to record everything.

(The picture gets cleaned up) 
RIKER: You were right. Somebody blew the hatch. They were all sucked
out into space. 
DATA: Correction, sir, that's blown out. 
RIKER: Thank you, Data. 
DATA: A common mistake, sir, 
TASHA [OC]: Commander Riker, Lieutenant Yar. Location Engineering. Ten
people here, sir, all frozen. No vital signs. 
RIKER: Frozen? How? 
TASHA [OC]: It looks like someone has been playing with the
environmental controls, sir. Just let all the heat bleed away into
space.
