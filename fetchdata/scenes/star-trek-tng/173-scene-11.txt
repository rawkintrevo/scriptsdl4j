[Turbolift]

(The doors open to reveal Christi and Geordi
kissing. Riker, waiting in the corridor, coughs) 
CHRISTI: Well, this is where I get off. See you tonight in Ten Forward?

LAFORGE: Yeah, I'll be there. 
CHRISTI: Hello, Commander. 
RIKER: Miss Henshaw. 
(Christi leaves and Riker enters the turbolift) 
RIKER: Bridge. 
LAFORGE: Deck six. 
RIKER: So, you and Miss Henshaw have been seeing a lot of each other. 
LAFORGE: Every night this week. 
RIKER: Is that all? I thought you'd been walking around with that smile
on your face a lot longer than that. 
LAFORGE: I guess I have. This whole last month or so everything seems
to be going my way. I don't know what it is, but something sure has
changed around here. 
RIKER: The only thing that's changed is you. 
LAFORGE: Me? I'm the same old guy I always was. 
RIKER: If you say so. I don't remember the old Geordi having that much
success with Miss Christi Henshaw. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe I am a little bit more confident than I used to
be.

[Sickbay]

(O'Brien enters, wearing a wetsuit and clutching
his arm) 
CRUSHER: What happened to you? 
O'BRIEN: I was kayaking in the holodeck again. 
CRUSHER: You dislocated your shoulder. Sit down, I'll get the
osteotractor frame. 
WESLEY: Hi mom. We still on for dinner tonight? 
CRUSHER: Seven thirty sharp. I'll be right back. 
WESLEY: Kayaking again? 
O'BRIEN: Yeah. 
WESLEY: How's my mom's favourite patient? 
JOHN: Judge for yourself. 
(John walks around unaided) 
WESLEY: Not bad. 
JOHN: Your mom promised me a tour of the ship tomorrow. You may find
this hard to believe, but Sickbay can be an incredibly boring place to
be. 
O'BRIEN: Hey, Doc! I'm dying here. 
JOHN: Don't worry my friend. You'll be alright. 
(Beverly returns to see John put his hand on O'Brien's shoulder.
There's a golden glow) 
O'BRIEN: The pain's gone. 
CRUSHER: It's completely healed. I don't understand. What did you do? 
JOHN: I don't know. It was instinct. I just touched him.

[Crushers' quarters]

(After dinner) 
CRUSHER: I've run every test and scan on him that I can think of, and
yet there's no physiological evidence to indicate that he would possess
such powers. But then, there's so much about John that's a mystery. 
WESLEY: You know, I really like him. 
CRUSHER: He does have a certain charm doesn't he? The entire medical
staff has commented on it. 
WESLEY: You seem a little taken with him yourself. 
CRUSHER: He has a strength and serenity that I find very attractive.
And yet he's vulnerable. I guess I find him intriguing. 
WESLEY: Seems like there's a little more to it than that. 
CRUSHER: Is this your way of asking me if I'm getting romantically
involved with him? 
WESLEY: You said it, I didn't. 
CRUSHER: My feelings toward him aren't romantic exactly. I mean, I know
that the doctor-patient relationship can sometimes create a false sense
of intimacy, but this is different. There's an almost spiritual
connection. I guess I'm not making any sense, am I? 
WESLEY: I think I understand.
