ARMUS [OC]: I lied to you. They came back. 
TROI: Let me talk with them. 
ARMUS [OC]: No. 
TROI: Why? Does the thought of my having contact with them make you
uneasy? 
ARMUS [OC]: No. Not being able to contact you, not knowing if you are
alive, makes them uneasy. Can't you feel how worried they are? 
TROI: Yes. Yes, they are worried. 
ARMUS [OC]: They care for you. You must be very special. 
TROI: We are members of a community. We all care for one another. 
ARMUS [OC]: Equally? 
TROI: You were really surprised they came back. 
ARMUS [OC]: Yes. 
TROI: Why? Because the others did not? 
ARMUS [OC]: What others? 
TROI: You can't hide the emptiness from me. The others. The ones who
hurt you. Who left you alone, rejected. The ones who make you so angry.

ARMUS [OC]: What do you know of them? 
TROI: Only what you tell me. 
ARMUS [OC]: I will tell you nothing. 
TROI: Not now. But soon.

WORF: Captain, look at this. The force of the
energy field around the shuttlecraft decreased for a few moments when
the creature was draped over it. 
PICARD: But not low enough to beam them out. 
WORF: Almost. 
WESLEY: It's approaching the away team now, and the energy field over
the shuttlecraft is back to full intensity. 
PICARD: Chart it. I want to see if there's a pattern. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

(Armus rises from his slick) 
ARMUS: She said you'd be back. 
RIKER: Then she is alive. 
ARMUS: For now. Why have you returned? 
RIKER: We have no choice. We're here to negotiate for our team. What do
you want? 
ARMUS: Maybe I want nothing. 
RIKER: Then you would have killed all of us. 
ARMUS: I still might. 
RIKER: What do you want? Tell me. Maybe we can reach an accommodation. 
ARMUS: If I tell you, will you give it to me? 
RIKER: I might. It depends. 
CRUSHER: I am a doctor. I need to treat our injured friends. 
ARMUS: Say please. 
CRUSHER: Please. 
ARMUS: You ask nicely. I will allow it. Wait! I've changed my mind.
Talk to her from here. 
CRUSHER: How? Troi, can you hear me? 
[Shuttlecraft]

BEVERLY [OC]: Deanna, are you all right? 
TROI: Beverly?

[Planet surface]

TROI [OC]: I can hear you. 
CRUSHER: Are you all right?

[Shuttlecraft]

TROI: Yes.
