[Troi's quarters]

(Crusher enters to see Kevin holding his hand over
Troi's head) 
GUEST1: I've taken the music from her mind. She's alright now. She's
sleeping. She was beginning to sense who I really was. I've been living
as a human for over fifty years but I couldn't hide from her. She has
suffered because of my pride and selfishness. It will not happen again.

(Picard has entered during that speech) 
PICARD: What happened on Rana Four? The truth this time. All of it. 
GUEST1: Very well. For what it's worth. I am a Douwd. An immortal being
of disguises and false surroundings. I have lived in
this galaxy for many thousands of years although until today, no one
has known my true identity. Once, while traveling in human form, I
chanced to fall in love with an Earth woman. I put aside my powers and
became her husband. Our life was happy and rich. Eventually we came to
this planet to live our final years. Now she is dead. She never knew
what I really was. 
PICARD: Your colony was attacked by a warship. 
GUEST1: Belonging to the Husnock, a species of hideous intelligence who
knew only aggression and destruction. I could have
destroyed them with a mere thought, but I did not do so. 
CRUSHER: You had the power to stop them but you didn't? 
GUEST1: I refused to for the same reason I refused to stop the
Enterprise. I will not kill. 
PICARD: So you let the colonists fight a hopeless battle. 
GUEST1: I tried to fool the Husnock as I tried to fool you. It only made
them angrier. More cruel. 
PICARD: And then what you most feared, happened. Rishon went to fight
with the colonists, and died with them. 
GUEST1: How I wish I could have died with her. 
PICARD: But you couldn't. You were left alone. 
GUEST1: Yes. I saw her broken body. I went insane. My hatred exploded,
and in an instant of grief I destroyed the Husnock. 
CRUSHER: Why did you try to hide this from all of us? Was it out of
guilt for not helping Rishon and the others when they were alive? 
GUEST1: No, no, no, no. You don't understand the scope of my crime. I
didn't kill just one Husnock, or a hundred, or a thousand. I killed
them all. All Husnock everywhere. Are eleven thousand people worth
fifty billion? Is the love of a woman worth the destruction of an
entire species? This is the sin I tried so hard to keep you from
learning now. Why I wanted to chase you from Rana. 
PICARD: We're not qualified to be your judges. We have no law to fit
your crime. You're free to return to the planet and to make Rishon live
again.
