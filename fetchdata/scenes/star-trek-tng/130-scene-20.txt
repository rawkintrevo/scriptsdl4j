(The fathers and children are beamed aboard
together) 
ROBINSON: They have no weapons. 
WORF: This way. 
[Conference room]

(No big table, just a few comfortable chairs
scattered around) 
DEBIN: Okona, you are without shame. 
KUSHELL: For once I agree with Debin. You are without shame. I trusted
you. My son treated you like a brother. And then to steal from us. I
want him now. 
DEBIN: No, he's coming with me. Captain, my complaint was registered
first. 
PICARD: Now please, please, be calm. Lieutenant, thank you. 
(Worf leaves) 
OKONA: Everyone is talking about me, and no one's talking to me. You
all believe that I stole the jewel, and that it was I who fathered the
child. 
DEBIN: You dare call my daughter a liar? 
OKONA: And now I'm offered these two choices, and given these two
options, condemnation as a thief or marriage to the beautiful Yanar. I
will take the more pleasant sentence. I will take Yanar as my wife. 
BENZAN: No! You can't! 
KUSHELL: My son is right. You can't escape that way. 
BENZAN: That's not what I mean. 
DEBIN: It's not up to you, or to Okona. I've been dishonoured. I will
decide. 
YANAR: Wait. Since all of you believe Okona is the father of this
child, then so be it. I'll marry you. 
BENZAN: No! You can't. 
YANAR: Yes, I can. 
KUSHELL: Okona is still a thief. 
BENZAN: No, he's not. Nothing has been stolen. The Jewel of Thesia has
been taken into custody by its rightful heir. Me. I was to give it to
Yanar as our pledge of marriage. 
KUSHELL: Marriage? 
BENZAN: Yanar is carrying my child. 
DEBIN: You said it was Okona's. 
YANAR: If I'd told you it was Benzan you would have gone to war with
his father. So I let you believe it was Okona. 
OKONA: See how a man gets a reputation? 
BENZAN: If I had told you I was giving the Jewel to Debin's daughter,
you'd have disowned me. 
TROI: Now we're hearing some truth. 
KUSHELL: So you let me chase Okona when you knew he was innocent. 
BENZAN: Yes, because I didn't believe for one moment that you could
catch him. 
OKONA: Well, said. He never would have. 
BENZAN: And once Yanar accepted the Jewel the marriage would have been
made. 
YANAR: Well, I never got it. 
KUSHELL: Then Okona does have the jewel. 
OKONA: I never had the chance to deliver it.
YANAR: Anyway it's too late. I won't marry Benzan. 
DEBIN: Then you'll marry Okona. 
YANAR: I won't marry anyone!
