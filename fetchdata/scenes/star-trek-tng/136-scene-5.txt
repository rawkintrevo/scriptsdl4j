[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Bridge, this is Engineering. 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: Now that we're out of warp, I'd like to use this time to make
some routine adjustments on the deuterium control conduit. We're
overdue.

[Bridge]

PICARD: How much time will these adjustments
require, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE [OC]: A couple of hours, sir. 
RIKER: Proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Wes, I'm going to need an SCM model three,
from ship's stores. Can you handle that? 
WESLEY: Right away. 
LAFORGE: All right. 
[Bridge]

(The planet on the viewscreen is a pale mustard
colour) 
PICARD: Magnify, Mister Worf. Hardly an inviting planet, even for a
research establishment. 
TROI: I would have thought the inhabitants of Daled Four would send a
future leader to a more hospitable environment. 
WORF: For some, security is more important than comfort. 
TROI: Yes, but sixteen years. 
WORF: Captain, we're being hailed. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise. 
ANYA [OC]: (very faint and static-ridden) I am Anya of 
DATA: Sir, the planet's troposphere is distorting our signal. 
PICARD: Can you clean that up, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I'll try. Now. 
PICARD: This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat your
message? 
ANYA [OC]: I am Anya. Have you come for Salia of Daled Four? 
PICARD: That is correct. 
ANYA [OC]: What species are you? 
PICARD: Human. 
ANYA [OC]: Excellent. Bring us aboard. That is all. 
RIKER: Friendly, isn't she? 
PICARD: Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state, so we
will treat her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's go
greet our visitors. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

(O'Brien beams a young woman and her older
chaperone aboard. No luggage) 
PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. 
ANYA: This is Salia of Daled Four. 
SALIA: I didn't feel a thing. Is that normal when one is transported,
Captain? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, it is. 
SALIA: Those must be the matter energy conversion controls. May I take
a look? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. 
RIKER: I can arrange for a tour of the ship, if you'd like. 
SALIA: Oh, I'd love that. 
ANYA: No, that will not be necessary. Just show us to our quarters,
Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Very well.
