Captain's personal log. I'm entering the ship's
holodeck, where images of reality can be created by our computer.
Highly useful in crew training, highly enjoyable when used for games
and recreation.

[Hill's Waiting room]

(In uniform, Picard goes along a corridor being
washed by a cleaner, listening to music - you came to me from out of
nowhere, you took my heart - and opens a door marked 312 - Dixon Hill
Private Investigator) 
SECRETARY: Very funny, Dix. What'd you do, lose another bet? 
PICARD: I'm sorry, I don't understand. 
SECRETARY: The bellboy suit. Are you moonlighting at the Fremont? 
PICARD: The uniform. It's totally inappropriate. I should have changed.

SECRETARY: Detective Bell, your cop friend, McNary's new partner, was
here nosing around. If he'd have seen you in those threads he'd have
you sent to the funny farm. Mister Leech called twice, and there's a
lady named Bradley waiting in your office. Nice legs. Not you. Her. Got
a hot date with my fella. See you in the morning. 
(She leaves, laughing. Picard opens the door to his inner office and we
go into Maltese Falcon territory) 
PICARD: I lost a bet. 
JESSICA: Oh well, at least you're ready for Halloween. 
PICARD: Halloween? 
JESSICA: I need your help, Mister Hill. Someone is trying to kill me.

Captain's personal log. I'm delighted with how the
Holodeck has created the fictional world of Dixon Hill, the twentieth
century detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood. The
illusion is flawless. The characters I meet are generated by the
computer, of course, yet they feel real, they seem real in every way.
