[Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: Ro! 
CRUSHER: Welcome home. 
RO: Thanks. It's good to be back. 
TROI: Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant. 
RO: Same to you, Commander. 
TROI: Thank you. 
LAFORGE: Say, I understand that Advanced Tactical Training is a real
picnic. 
RO: Right. 
CRUSHER: Did you see the buffet? 
TROI: This is real Bajoran foraiga. 
LAFORGE: It wasn't easy to find. 
RO: You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. Really. 
CRUSHER: We wanted you to know how glad we are to have you back. 
(Picard leaves in the background) 
TROI: So, where are your new quarters? 
RO: Deck four, section eight. 
CRUSHER: What are do you planning to do 
PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant Ro. 
RO: Go ahead, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: Please report to the Bridge. 
RO: Yes, sir. Excuse me.

[Corridor]

RO: Captain. 
PICARD: You seemed a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. 
RO: Well, to tell you the truth, I really want to see everyone. I'd
just rather do it one at a time. 
PICARD: You look very fit, Lieutenant. Tactical Training seems to agree
with you. 
RO: You know me, I enjoy a challenge. 
PICARD: That school is more than a challenge. Half the class washes out
every year. But somehow I didn't think you'd be one of those. 
RO: Captain, I want you to know that I really appreciate your
recommending me. If it weren't for you, my life would be a very
different one right now. 
RIKER [OC]: Bridge to Picard. 
PICARD: Go ahead.
