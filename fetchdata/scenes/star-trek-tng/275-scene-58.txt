TROI: Please listen to me. We understand what's
happening. We know you have get to New Vertiform City, and we want to
help you get there. 
RUSTIC: Well, I don't know. 
TROI: Please, we're your friends. 
RUSTIC: You're really going to help get us to New Vertiform City? 
TROI: I promise. 
RUSTIC: Okay. But just one of you. The rest stay here.

[Holodeck - Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: That's far enough. 
GANGSTER: Sorry to spoil your party, pal. It's nothing personal. 
DATA: I can get us there more quickly. I know a shorter route. 
GANGSTER: Don't listen to him. He's up to somethin'. 
CONDUCTOR: A shorter route? 
DATA: Yes, if you will let me handle the controls. 
GANGSTER: Don't do it. 
CONDUCTOR: Well we're already behind schedule. If you can get us there
on time. All right, go on, but no funny stuff. 
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. I have taken control of the engine room. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Stand by. Are we within sensor range of the
nebula? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Captain, we are. 
PICARD: Mister Data, I need you to slow us to impulse speed. 
[Holodeck - Engine room]

DATA: I will attempt to do so. 
CONDUCTOR: I hope you know what you're doing. 
(Data closes a valve and pulls on the brake)

[Bridge]

PICARD: Are the modifications to the torpedoes
complete? 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Launch torpedo. 
(whoosh, KaBOOM) 
LAFORGE: It's working, Captain. The reaction is producing vertion
particles. 
[Holodeck Engine room]

CONDUCTOR: Well, what do you know? We're here. 
GANGSTER: New Vertiform City.

[Cargo bay]

RIKER: The nodes are deactivating all over the
ship. Our systems are beginning to function normally again. 
PICARD: Then the purpose of the ship's intelligence was simply to bring
this life form into being. 
CRUSHER: There are some species whose sole purpose is to reproduce.
Once they finally procreate, they die. 
LAFORGE: Captain.

out through the hull)

(it's a champagne send-off for baby, and as they
sip their drinks, Troi, Worf
and Data are in an empty holodeck)

Captain's log, supplemental. The Enterprise is back
under our control. All traces of the emergent intelligence are gone and
the object it created has disappeared into space.
