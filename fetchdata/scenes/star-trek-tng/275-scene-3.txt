PICARD: I never realised that you were interested
in trains. Are you aware that at its peak, the Orient Express carried
more than ten thousand
people a year? 
CRUSHER: It isn't really the train itself that I'm interested in. 
PICARD: What then?

RIKER [OC]: All sections ready to begin the survey, sir. 
PICARD: Very good. I'm on my way. Thank you. 
CRUSHER: Don't forget the trip, Jean-Luc. Think about it. You never

PICARD: Mister Data, report. 
DATA: The ship has moved into warp, sir. 
RIKER: Who gave that command? 
DATA: Apparently no one. Helm and navigation controls are not
functioning. Our speed is now warp seven point three and holding. 
PICARD: Picard to Engineering.
