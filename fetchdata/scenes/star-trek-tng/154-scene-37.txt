LAFORGE [OC]: The crystal lattice is breaking down. We'll have to pick
up repairs when we can reach a starbase.
RIKER: The optimist of the group. 
PICARD: How long do we have shields based on current calculations? 
WORF: Under two hours, Captain. And the radiation field has increased
by seventeen percent. 
PICARD: So what impact will that have on fatal exposure? 
CRUSHER: Down to twenty six minutes. 
RIKER: If we resist, we die. If we don't resist, we die. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge, have we shut down all non-essential energy
usage?

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. In fact, I need to get some
back. I'm running a programme on holodeck three.

PICARD: For what purpose? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Well, I've gone back to the beginning

LAFORGE: To the earliest construction entries of
