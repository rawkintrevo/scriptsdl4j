PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Commander. I'm Captain Picard.
This is Commander William Riker. He will be yielding the first
officer's position to you during your tour. 
KURN: You are relieved. May I take my station, Captain?

station.

KURN: I am Kurn, commander rank, Klingon Defence
Force. You will address me as Commander or sir at all times.
I am fully aware of all Starfleet regulations and they will be strictly
adhered to by all personnel while I am in command. It is my intention
to bring a sense of discipline that you may not be accustomed to. With
your permission, of course, Captain. 
PICARD: Oh, by all means, Commander. 
KURN: I have studied all of your service records. Impressive. We shall
see if you live up to your reputations. Do you wish to speak, Acting
Ensign Wesley Crusher? 
WESLEY: No, sir, Commander, sir. 
KURN: The crew awaits your orders, Captain. 
PICARD: Then take us to the outer cometary cloud, Commander. 
KURN: Set course one one four mark two three zero, one third impulse
power. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
KURN: Execute. 
WESLEY: Engaged. Increasing to one third impulse power, sir.
