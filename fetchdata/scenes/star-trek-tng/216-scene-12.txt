[Worf's private room]

(Riker enters carrying a robe and a knife) 
WORF: I am ready, Commander. 
RIKER: I've been studying this ritual of yours. Do you know what I've
decided? I think it's despicable. I hate everything about it. The
casual disregard for life, the way it tries to cloak suicide in some
glorious notion of honour. I may have to respect your beliefs, but I
don't have to like them. 
WORF: It is not something I expect you to understand. 
RIKER: No. All you really expect me to do is bring you the knife and
then walk away, so you can kill yourself in peace. Well, I'm not going
to make it that easy for you. 
WORF: It is not easy for me. But each of us must die in our own time,
and my time 
RIKER: Remember Sandoval? Hit by a disruptor blast two years ago. She
lived for about a week. Fang-lee? Marla Aster? Tasha Yar? How many men
and women, how many friends have we watched die? I've lost count. Every
one of them, every single one fought for life until the very end. 
WORF: I do not welcome death, Commander. 
RIKER: Are you sure? Because I get the sense you're feeling pretty
noble about the whole thing. Look at me, aren't I courageous? Aren't I
an honourable Klingon? Let me remind you of something. A Klingon does
not put his desires above those of his family or his friends. How many
people on this ship consider you a friend? How many owe you their
lives? Have you ever thought about how you've affected the people
around you? How we might feel about your dying? 
WORF: Will you, or will you not, help me with the Hegh'bat? 
RIKER: You are my friend, and in spite of everything I've said, if it
were my place, I would probably help you. But I've been studying
Klingon ritual and Klingon law, and I've discovered that it's not my
place to fill that role. According to tradition, that honour falls to a
family member. Preferably the oldest son. 
WORF: That is impossible. He is a child. 
RIKER: The son of a Klingon is a man the day he can first hold a blade.
True? 
WORF: Alexander is not fully Klingon he is part human. 
RIKER: That's an excuse. What you really mean is it would be too hard
for you to look at your son and tell him to bring you the knife. Watch
you stab it into your heart, then pull the knife from your chest and
wipe your blood on his sleeve. That's the rite of death, isn't it?
Well, I'm sorry, Mister Worf. I can't help you. There's only one person
on this ship who can. 
(Later, Alexander enters) 
ALEXANDER: You said you wanted to see me? 
WORF: I need you to help me. 
ALEXANDER: Anything, Father. 
WORF: I have taught you about Klingon customs, the beliefs which we
value. According to tradition, I must take my life after suffering this
kind of injury. But I have decided to break with tradition. I have
decided to live. 
ALEXANDER: I'm glad, Father. 
WORF: I must still undergo a dangerous operation. I may still die, but
it will not be by my own hand. Return this to our quarters. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir. 
(Alexander takes the knife away)

Chief Medical Officer's log, supplemental. After
further consultation with Starfleet Medical, and a great deal of soul
searching, I have reluctantly granted Lieutenant Worf's request to
undergo the genetronic procedure.
