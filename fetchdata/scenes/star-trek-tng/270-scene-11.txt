WORF: I apologise for being late. The viral medicines we are
transporting to Barson Two require special security measures to insure
they are properly contained. Have you found anything? 
TROI: No. There were literally thousands of people involved in building
the Enterprise. 
WORF: Perhaps if you should try to narrow the search parameters. 
TROI: I think I have. The man who looked familiar to me may have served
on board the Enterprise in the last seven years, so I've asked the
computer to limit its search to personnel who served at Utopia Planitia
and on the Enterprise. 
TROI: Ensign Salvatore. He transferred over a year ago. Lieutenant
Ziff. She's in Quantum mechanics. That's him. 
WORF: Lieutenant Walter Pierce. 
TROI: I remember now. He came on board about six months ago. I think
he's in Engineering. 
[Engineering]

WORF: You were Lieutenant Kwan's supervisor at
Utopia Planitia? 
GUEST1: That's right. I was sorry to hear what happened. 
TROI: Did you ever spend time in the nacelle control room while it was
under construction? 
GUEST1: I worked all over the ship. In fact, I remember running a power
conduit right behind this wall here. 
TROI: Were you ever in the nacelle room at the same time as Lieutenant
Kwan? 
GUEST1: It was a long time ago. People were working all over the place.

WORF: So you do not remember? 
GUEST1: I'm sorry, I don't. 
TROI: Do you recall if anything unusual happened there? 
GUEST1: How do you mean? 
TROI: An altercation, perhaps. Possibly involving Lieutenant Kwan. 
GUEST1: No, nothing like that. The way I remember it, things went
pretty smoothly. What's this all about, if you don't mind my asking? 
TROI: Not at all. When I was in the nacelle room I had an empathic
experience. 
WORF: We believe the Counsellor may have been seeing an event that
occurred eight years ago. 
TROI: And I saw you there. Do you have any idea why that might be? 
GUEST1: I'm afraid I don't. 
TROI: Lieutenant, are you aware that I can sense when someone's telling
the truth? 
GUEST1: I've heard that. 
TROI: Then I'm sure that if you remember anything that might be
relevant to our investigation, you'll contact me. 
GUEST1: Of course. 
TROI: Thank you, Lieutenant. 
GUEST1: Counsellor.
