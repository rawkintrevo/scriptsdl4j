(Picard wakes up) 
PICARD: Computer, where is Admiral Riker? 
COMPUTER: Admiral Riker is in Ten Forward.

[Future - Ten Forward]

LAFORGE: The ship has held up pretty well over the
years. 
RIKER: They tried to decommission her about five years ago. One of the
advantages of being an Admiral is you get to choose your own ship. 
CRUSHER: Will, how long is this thing between you and Worf going to go
on? 
RIKER: It's been going on for over twenty years. Doesn't look like it's
going to end any time soon. 
DATA: I suspect the last thing Counsellor Troi would have wanted is for
the two of you to be alienated. 
CRUSHER: I agree. I think it's time to put it behind you. 
RIKER: I tried at Deanna's funeral. He wouldn't even talk to me. 
LAFORGE: Might have been tough for him then. He took her death pretty
hard. 
RIKER: Oh, yeah? Well he wasn't the only one. 
CRUSHER: I know, but I think in his mind you were the reason that he
and Deanna never got together. 
RIKER: I never did anything to stand in his way. 
CRUSHER: Didn't you, Will? 
RIKER: Did I? I didn't want to admit that it was over. I always thought
that we'd get together again. And then she was gone. You think you have
all the time in the world, until. Yeah.
