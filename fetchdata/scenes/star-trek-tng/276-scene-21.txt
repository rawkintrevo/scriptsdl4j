RIKER WORF PICARD RO DATA KALITA

[Ro's ship]

RO: The Enterprise shields have a weak point. When
the ship is at impulse, the thrust destabilises the shield
configuration right at this point. (between the nacelles) I'm going to
try to punch through there. 
KALITA: Won't they detect us? 
RO: They'll know something's penetrated the shields. With all the
interference it'll take them a few seconds to find us. We'll have to
beam the medical supplies aboard and get out fast. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The message is difficult to decode.
Interference has garbled much of the transmission, but it seems to be
from Lieutenant Ro. 
PICARD: Ro is on that ship? 
DATA: Sir, a vessel of some kind is attempting to penetrate our aft
shields. 
PICARD: Let it through.

[Ro's ship]

RO: We're going to make it. All right, we're in. 
KALITA: Energising. 
(their hold is filled up) 
RO: Let's get out of here. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Captain, a quantity of medical supplies was
beamed from cargo bay seven. 
DATA: The vessel that penetrated our shields is of the same design as
the ships used by the Maquis. It is moving off. 
PICARD: Let it go. There must be someone with her. We should make it
look as though we're trying to stop them. Mister Worf, lock phasers on
their previous position and fire. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Now we know what they mean by Advanced Tactical Training.
