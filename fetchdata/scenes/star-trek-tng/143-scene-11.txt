(The Bridge crew are watching everything on the

TROI: Commander? Lieutenant La Forge is on an alien ship? 
RIKER: Yes. We're rendering assistance to some curious throwbacks. 
DATA: How they ever mastered the rudiments of space travel is a genuine
curiosity. 
TROI: Commander. Those aliens. What they feel is not helplessness.
Lieutenant La Forge is in great danger! He's in danger, great danger. 
RIKER: Can you be more specific, Counsellor? 
TROI: It's not our help they want. 
RIKER: Well, our help is all they're going to get. They can't force us
into anything, can they? 
TROI: You think they're weak. 
RIKER: Look at them. They're certainly not Jarada or Romulans. 
DATA: Our Betazoid Counsellor is often aware of things beyond our
perceptive abilities.

PICARD: Van Doren's technique has been perfected to
two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD: The cardiac replacement procedure. It has a very low mortality
rate. Two point four percent. 
WESLEY: Those are pretty good odds. 
PICARD: Just not overly thrilled at the prospect of having my innards
becoming the subject of Starfleet gossip. 
WESLEY: Of course not, sir. Why didn't you just have Doctor Pulaski
perform the operation? I'm sure you could've trusted her to keep it
quiet. 
PICARD: Let's say I have personal reasons and leave it at that, shall
we?

[Pakled ship]

LAFORGE: The power needs to be rerouted through
this venturi chamber before it can be channelled to the engine's coils.

REGINOD: It is broken. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but not for long. See, we are going to reconfigure these
separators, here and over here. 
RIKER [OC]: Lieutenant La Forge, this is Commander Riker. Come in. 
LAFORGE: Yes, Commander. Go ahead.
