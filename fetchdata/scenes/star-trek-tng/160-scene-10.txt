[Plaza]

(The waiter has been arrested) 
RIKER: This is no way to live. 
GUEST1: For us or them? 
RIKER: For both of you. 
GUEST1: I know it's not pretty, Riker, but this is what terrorism has
done to this city. 
RIKER: There's got to be a better way to deal with it than this. 
GUEST1: My methods may seem harsh but believe me, they're gentle
compared to my predecessors. Suspects would be brought into police
headquarters and mysteriously vanish. I put a stop to that. 
RIKER: What happened to your predecessors? 
GUEST1: They were murdered. 
RIKER: Are you going to tell me that little boy's a threat? 
(Two children are being handcuffed) 
GUEST1: It's possible. That shuttlebus I told you about? The bomb was
set by a teenager. In a world where children blow up children,
everyone's a threat.

(Finn is sketching as Beverly tends to her patients
with the boy) 
CRUSHER: It's okay. Over there. 
(She sees what he's drawing - her hand holding another hand) 
CRUSHER: You should be drawing, not killing people. 
FINN: I can do both. 
CRUSHER: How can you have such a casual attitude toward killing? 
FINN: I take my killing very seriously, Doctor. You are an idealist. 
CRUSHER: I live in an ideal culture. There's no need for your kind of
violence. We've proven that. 
FINN: Your origins on Earth are from the American continent, are they
not? 
CRUSHER: North America. 
FINN: Yes, I've read your history books. This is a war for
independence, and I am no different than your own George Washington 
CRUSHER: Washington was a military general, not a terrorist. 
FINN: The difference between generals and terrorists, Doctor, is only
the difference between winners and losers. You win, you're called a
general. You lose 
CRUSHER: You are killing innocent people! Can't you see the immorality
of what you're doing or have you killed so much you've become blind to
it? 
FINN: How much innocent blood has been spilled for the cause of freedom
in the history of your Federation, Doctor? How many good and noble
societies have bombed civilians in war, have wiped out whole cities.
And now that you enjoy the comfort that has come from their battles,
their killing, you frown on my immorality? I am willing to die for my
freedom, Doctor.
And in the finest tradition of your own great civilisation, I'm willing
to kill for it, too.
