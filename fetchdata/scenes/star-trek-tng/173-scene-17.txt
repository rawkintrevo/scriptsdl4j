[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, I am reading a vessel on long range
scanners. It is coming from sector nine five six nine. 
PICARD: What configuration? 
WORF: Impossible to identify at this distance. However, it is on an
intercept course. 
DATA: Captain, the ship is travelling at warp nine point seven two. 
RIKER: Warp nine point seven two? 
PICARD: Time to intercept? 
DATA: At present course and speed, ten hours fifty three minutes. 
PICARD: Try and hail them, Mister Worf. 
WORF: No response, Captain. 
PICARD: Keep monitoring their approach. Repeat the hail every half an
hour. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Whoever they are, they're in a big hurry to get here.

[Sickbay - room four]

(John has a big golden moment, and the alarm
sounds) 
TEMPLE: Doctor Crusher, medical emergency, room four. 
JOHN: I can't make it stop. 
CRUSHER: John, tell me. Is it worse than before? 
JOHN: Much worse. 
TEMPLE: Should I get something for the pain? 
CRUSHER: No. The readings are fluctuating too wildly. Besides, it
wouldn't do any good. His entire cell structure is transforming. 
JOHN: I have to leave, Beverly. 
CRUSHER: John, where do you have to go? 
JOHN: I must get off this ship. 
CRUSHER: That's impossible. Not in your condition. 
JOHN: I must! 
(another big moment, and he runs out the door)

[Corridor]

CRUSHER: Security.
