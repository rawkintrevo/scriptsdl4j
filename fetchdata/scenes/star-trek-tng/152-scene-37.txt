RIKER BARRON NURIA PICARD TROI LIKO DATA OJI

[Assembly hall]

NURIA: We will keep Troi captive. 
LIKO: That's not enough. 
NURIA: You would have us harm her? 
LIKO: If it will hold off the Picard's anger, yes. I've seen how
powerful he is. 
NURIA: I am unwilling to hurt her needlessly. We will wait for Hali to
return. 
OJI: And if they don't find Palmer? 
NURIA: Then we may have to do as Liko suggests.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: Doctor, you believe the Mintakans are
capable of harming Counsellor Troi? 
BARRON: They are not normally a violent people but these are
extraordinary circumstances. They're trying to comprehend what they
believe to be a god. 
PICARD: Recommendations? 
BARRON: The Mintakans wish to please the Overseer, but they can only
guess what he wants. They need a sign. 
PICARD: Are you suggesting? 
BARRON: You must go down to Mintaka Three. 
RIKER: Masquerading as a god? 
PICARD: Absolutely out of the question. The Prime Directive 
BARRON: Has already been violated. The damage is done. All we can do
now is minimise it. 
PICARD: By sanctioning their false beliefs? 
BARRON: By giving them guidelines. Letting them know what the Overseer
expects of them. 
PICARD: Doctor Barron, I cannot, I will not, impose a set of
commandments on these people. To do so violates the very essence of the
Prime Directive. 
BARRON: Like it or not, we have rekindled the Mintakans' belief in the
Overseer. 
RIKER: And are you saying that this belief will eventually become a
religion? 
BARRON: It's inevitable. And without guidance, that religion could
degenerate into inquisitions, holy wars, chaos. 
PICARD: Horrifying. Doctor Barron, your report describes how rational
these people are. Millennia ago, they abandoned their belief in the
supernatural. Now you are asking me to sabotage that achievement, to
send them back into the Dark Ages of superstition and ignorance and
fear? No! We will find some way to undo the damage we've caused. Number
One, tell me about this group's leader. 
RIKER: Nuria. Exceptionally clear-minded, sensible. The Mintakans trust
her judgment. If we can convince her that you are not a god 
PICARD: She might be able to persuade the others. 
BARRON: And how do you propose to convince her? 
PICARD: She believes the Picard is a magical figure. I'm going to show
her how the magic works. I'm going to bring her aboard.

[Assembly hall]

DATA [OC]: Counsellor, sensors indicate five
Mintakans in your immediate vicinity. Four are motionless. The fifth is
eight meters away, proceeding south. Is Nuria one of these five? 
TROI: Mmm hmm.

[Bridge]

DATA: Was that intended to be an affirmative? 
RIKER: Yes, Data, it was. 
DATA: Is Nuria the closest of the five? 
TROI [OC]: Uh un. 
RIKER: Negative. 
[Assembly hall]

DATA [OC]: Is Nuria the one in motion? 
TROI: Mmm hmm. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Lock sensors on Nuria. 
DATA: Locked on. We can beam Nuria aboard at will. 
PICARD: Data, when sensors indicate she's alone, beam her directly to
transporter room one. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

PICARD: Ensign Hoy? 
DATA [OC]: Captain, Nuria is alone. 
PICARD: I'll handle this. 
(Hoy leaves, and Picard beams Nuria aboard) 
PICARD: Nuria, don't be afraid. No one is going to harm you. 
NURIA: Who? 
PICARD: I am Jean Luc Picard. 
(Nuria falls to her knees, face down) 
PICARD: Please, get up. Get up. You must not kneel to me. 
NURIA: You do not wish it? 
PICARD: I do not deserve it. Look at me. Look at me. Feel the warmth of
my hand, the rhythm of my pulse. I'm not a supreme being. I'm flesh and
blood, like you. 
NURIA: Not like me. 
PICARD: Like you. Different in appearance, yes. But we are both living
beings. We are born, we grow, we live and we die. In all the ways that
matter, we are alike. 
NURIA: But you are the Picard! 
PICARD: There is something I want you to see. 
(The doors open and she jumps back) 
NURIA: What a wondrous place. Even the walls obey your command. 
PICARD: Wondrous, yes, but not miraculous. The doors merely work
differently from the ones you know.

[Observation lounge]

NURIA: That is my home? 
PICARD: Seen from far, far above. 
NURIA: Yet we do not fall. I never imagined I would see the clouds from
the other side. Your powers are truly boundless. 
PICARD: Nuria, your people live in huts. Was it always so? 
NURIA: No. We have found remnants of tools in caves. Our ancestors must
have lived there. 
PICARD: So why do you now live in huts? 
NURIA: Huts are better. Caves are dark and wet. 
PICARD: If huts are better, why did you once live in caves? 
NURIA: The most reasonable explanation would be that at one time we
didn't know how to make huts. 
PICARD: Just as at one time you did not know how to weave cloth, how to
make a bow. 
NURIA: That would be reasonable. 
PICARD: Someone invented a hut. Someone invented a bow, who taught
others, who taught their children, who built a stronger hut, built a
better bow, who taught their children. Now, Nuria, suppose one of your
cave dwelling ancestors could see you as you are today. What would she
think? 
NURIA: I don't know. 
PICARD: Put yourself in her place. You see, she cannot kill a hornbuck
at a great distance. You can. You have a power she lacks. 
NURIA: Only because I have a bow. 
PICARD: She's never seen a bow. It doesn't exist in her world. To you,
it's a simple tool. To her, it's magic. 
NURIA: I suppose she might think so. 
PICARD: Now, how would she react to you? 
NURIA: I think she would fear me. 
PICARD: Just as you fear me. 
NURIA: I do not fear you any longer. 
PICARD: Good. That's good. You see, my people once lived in caves. And
then we learned to build huts and, in time, to build ships like this
one.
NURIA: Perhaps one day, my people will travel above the skies. 
PICARD: Of that, I have absolutely no doubt.
