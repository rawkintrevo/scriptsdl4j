RIKER DOKACHIN LAFORGE WORF PICARD KVADA

[Klingon Bridge]

K'VADA: Captain. We've monitored a subspace message
that might interest you.
(Picard reads the PADD) 
PICARD: Sarek is dead.

[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching
at warp speed.
RIKER: Identification?
WORF: Negative. No transponder signal, no subspace marker. 
LAFORGE: Sounds like they don't want to be identified.
WORF: The ship is coming out of warp, sir. 
RIKER: On screen.
LAFORGE: Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily
armed. Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with
cargo. I'd say from these internal scans, a good deal of that cargo is
weaponry.
WORF: The ship is entering sector twelve delta four 
DOKACHIN: He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli. The
coordinates are identical.
LAFORGE: Commander, readings indicate surface to ship transport has
begun.
RIKER: Mister La Forge, bring the engines back online and restore all
systems to normal.
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
WORF: He's powering up engines, turning to starboard.
RIKER: Open a channel.
WORF: Open.
RIKER: This is Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise. Identify
yourself. I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot. Identify
yourself.
WORF: Sir, the ship is locking phasers.
RIKER: Shields up. Red alert.
LAFORGE: That ship easily matches our armament, Commander.
WORF: It's coming about.
RIKER: If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that as
evidence of hostile action.
WORF: There is an energy build up in their phaser banks. Sir, they're
activating weapons. 
(thump) 
WORF: Forward shields down to seventy two percent.
RIKER: Boost power to the shields. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
RIKER: Mister Worf, lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare to
fire. 
(Enterprise takes more hits) 
WORF: Forward shields down to sixty eight percent, aft shields forty
percent.
RIKER: On my mark, point seven five burst. We just want to get their
attention.
WORF: Ready, sir.
RIKER: Fire.
WORF: Their forward shields are damaged, sir. 
LAFORGE: We destroyed one of their phaser arrays. Looks like collateral
damage in the cargo area. Commander, I'm picking up massive power
fluctuations, internal explosions. With all the armament that ship is
carrying, it's going to blow. 
(KaBOOM. Geordi was right)
