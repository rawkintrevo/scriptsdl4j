[Bridge]

PICARD: How much time will these adjustments
require, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE [OC]: A couple of hours, sir. 
RIKER: Proceed, Lieutenant La Forge. Standard orbit, Ensign.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Wes, I'm going to need an SCM model three,
from ship's stores. Can you handle that? 
WESLEY: Right away. 
LAFORGE: All right. 
[Bridge]

(The planet on the viewscreen is a pale mustard
colour) 
PICARD: Magnify, Mister Worf. Hardly an inviting planet, even for a
research establishment. 
TROI: I would have thought the inhabitants of Daled Four would send a
future leader to a more hospitable environment. 
WORF: For some, security is more important than comfort. 
TROI: Yes, but sixteen years. 
WORF: Captain, we're being hailed. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Open. 
PICARD: This is Captain Picard of the USS Enterprise. 
ANYA [OC]: (very faint and static-ridden) I am Anya of 
DATA: Sir, the planet's troposphere is distorting our signal. 
PICARD: Can you clean that up, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I'll try. Now. 
PICARD: This is Picard of the Enterprise. Please will you repeat your
message? 
ANYA [OC]: I am Anya. Have you come for Salia of Daled Four? 
PICARD: That is correct. 
ANYA [OC]: What species are you? 
PICARD: Human. 
ANYA [OC]: Excellent. Bring us aboard. That is all. 
RIKER: Friendly, isn't she? 
PICARD: Friendly or not, Salia has the rank of head of state, so we
will treat her and Anya accordingly. Number One, Mister Worf, let's go
greet our visitors. You have the Bridge, Mister Data. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

(O'Brien beams a young woman and her older
chaperone aboard. No luggage) 
PICARD: Welcome to the Enterprise. I'm Captain Picard. 
ANYA: This is Salia of Daled Four. 
SALIA: I didn't feel a thing. Is that normal when one is transported,
Captain? 
PICARD: Oh, yes, it is. 
SALIA: Those must be the matter energy conversion controls. May I take
a look? 
PICARD: Yes, of course. 
RIKER: I can arrange for a tour of the ship, if you'd like. 
SALIA: Oh, I'd love that. 
ANYA: No, that will not be necessary. Just show us to our quarters,
Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Very well.

[Corridor]

PICARD: We're accommodating you in quarters
normally reserved for Starfleet admiralty. I'm sure you'll find them
quite comfortable. 
(Wesley exits a turbolift as the party passes. The universe stands
still as Salia smiles at him, then turns back to speak) 
SALIA: That's a superconducting magnet, isn't it? 
WESLEY: Yes It's an SCM model. How did you know that? 
SALIA: Study, for the last sixteen years it is all I could 
ANYA: Please, Salia, walk ahead with me. 
SALIA: Better be careful. Those can rip the iron right out of your
blood cells. 
(The party moves on, minus Riker) 
WESLEY: Commander, who is she? 
RIKER: I think she's a governess. 
WESLEY: No! The girl. 
RIKER: I don't know if she'll have time for you, Wes. She's destined to
rule an entire world.
