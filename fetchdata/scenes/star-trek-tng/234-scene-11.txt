RIKER CRUSHER DATA LAFORGE

[Rehearsal room]

CRUSHER: Okay, let's work through Act two from the
beginning. Whenever you're ready. 
(Riker mimes entering through a door, then reads from his PADD) 
RIKER: Felis catus, is your taxonomic nomenclature. An endothermic
quadruped, carnivorous by nature.
CRUSHER: Hold it. Will, what are you reading? 
RIKER: The lines. Why? 
CRUSHER: That's not the right dialogue. 
(She takes his PADD) 
CRUSHER: Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses contribute to 
RIKER: I recognise it. This is Data's poetry. 
CRUSHER: What? The play's gone. I just keep getting more poetry.

(Geordi has the PADDs in pieces) 
LAFORGE: Well, the PADDs are functioning normally. It seems to be a
problem with the information retrieval net. Somehow when you tried to
call up your play, the computer accessed Data's literary files. 
DATA: Geordi, perhaps this problem is related to our interface
experiment. 
LAFORGE: We'd better run a level two diagnostic on the computer. See if
this problem has spread to any other systems. 
DATA: And I will perform a self-diagnostic. 
LAFORGE: That's a good idea. 
CRUSHER: You will let me know if you find the play? 
LAFORGE: Oh yeah, don't worry. It's in here somewhere.

a bag of money, when he is grabbed)
