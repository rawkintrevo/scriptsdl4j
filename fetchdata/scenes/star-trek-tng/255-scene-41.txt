SILVA DATA LAFORGE
eventually disconnect descent ll alive maintain descending close stationary

SILVA: We need your help. 
LAFORGE: I've been thinking about this. I'm going to take the Raman
into a low stationary orbit and initiate an inverse warp cascade. 
SILVA: Why? 
LAFORGE: The subspace distortion from the cascade should reverse the
warp funnel. Your ship will end up right back where it started.

DATA: Geordi, the atmosphere becomes increasingly
turbulent the farther down you go. You may not be able to bring the
Raman close enough to the Hera before being destroyed. 
LAFORGE: I have to try, Data.

SILVA: We're running out of time. 
LAFORGE: Shields back online. We're starting our descent. Thank God. 
SILVA: Thank God? 
LAFORGE: That you're alive. That I was right about all of this. I can't
wait to call Dad. He and Ariana had given up. 
SILVA: We're going home. 
LAFORGE: Well, eventually, yeah. Data, everything's fading in and out.

[Laboratory]

LAFORGE: I'm losing the interface. 
DATA: The probe is descending out of range. 
LAFORGE: You'll have to turn up the input gain to maintain my
connection. 
DATA: We are already at seventy five percent of tolerance. 
LAFORGE: Data, you can turn it all the way up to a hundred if you
increase it slowly enough. Give my nervous system chance to adjust. 
DATA: That is theoretically true, but even at this level of input you
are already experiencing dangerous neural feedback. 
LAFORGE: There are over three hundred people on board the Hera, Data.
You and I are the only chance they've got. 
DATA: I will increase the gain incrementally as you descend.

[Raman Auxiliary control]

LAFORGE: It's working.

[Laboratory]

DATA: When we are ready to disconnect the
interface, we must allow enough time to lower the input levels,
otherwise your nervous system will go into shock from the sudden drop
in input.
