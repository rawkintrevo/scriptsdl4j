PICARD RIKER DATA WORF ALEXANDER

[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister Data, how long before the wave
overtakes us? 
DATA: At our current speed, four minutes thirty seconds, sir. 
WORF: Captain, permission to leave the bridge. 
PICARD: Granted. Commander, will you accompany Mister Worf to biolab
four. 
DATA: Captain, biolab four is one of the areas that will be flooded
with ion radiation. 
PICARD: Commander. I can't let the soliton wave hit the colony. You
have three minutes, not one second more.

[Corridor]

RIKER: Primary control's shorted out. 
(Worf rips a panel from the wall and rearranges chips)
WORF: Stand clear. 
(the door opens and flames burst out before being suppressed)

[Biolab]

(there are pockets of fire everywhere) 
WORF: Alexander! 
RIKER: Alexander, can you hear me? Alexander? 
[Bridge]

DATA: The soliton wave has closed to ten
kilometres, Captain. 
PICARD: Stand by to fire torpedoes on my command.

[Biolab]

RIKER: Alexander! 
WORF: Commander, I've found him! 
(he is pinned under the remains of something) 
RIKER: Worf! Where are you Worf? 
WORF: Over here. Help me. 
(they try to lift the debris) 
RIKER: It's too heavy. I've got to find something to help us. 
ALEXANDER: Father? 
WORF: Lie still, I am here. 
ALEXANDER: My leg hurts. I'm scared. 
(with a massive paternal adrenalin rush, Worf moves the debris just as
Riker returns with a lever. Worf takes Alexander in his arms) 
ALEXANDER: The gilvos! 
RIKER: There's no time. 
ALEXANDER: Please, they'll die!

[Bridge]

DATA: The wave has closed to one kilometre,
Captain. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. Bridge to Lieutenant Worf,
acknowledge. 
DATA: The wave is about to overtake us, sir. 
PICARD: Commander Riker, acknowledge! Fire torpedoes.
