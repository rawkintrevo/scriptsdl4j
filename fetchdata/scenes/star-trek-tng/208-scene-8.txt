PICARD RIKER KVADA LAFORGE WORF

[Cargo bay]

LAFORGE: What we seem to have here is a
navigational deflector array. Or at least what's left of one.
RIKER: Why would anyone want a Vulcan shield array? 
LAFORGE: Beats me, Commander. Every question we answer here seems to
bring up two more.
PICARD: You're certain this is Vulcan? 
LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Metallurgical analysis confirmed that and by running
a molecular pattern trace, we were actually able to identify the ship
as T'Pau. It was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot
at Qualor Two. As far as anybody knows it's still there.
WORF [OC]: Worf to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Yes, Lieutenant?
WORF [OC]: A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow. Compliments
of Gowron.
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain and
advise him that Mister Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir.
RIKER: I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor Two, sir. See what's
out there.
PICARD: Agreed. Thank you, Mister La Forge.

[Klingon Bridge]

K'VADA: I know my duty, Captain. When I am given
orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets. I want to know why we
are going on this mission.
PICARD: I'm sorry. It's a classified matter.
K'VADA: You're going after the defector, aren't you?
PICARD: Defector? 
K'VADA: Do you think information like that stays a secret? Ambassador
Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
PICARD: Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of co-ordinates
near Romulus and to bring us back, and that is all I am prepared to
discuss.
K'VADA: If we are discovered by the Romulans it means death for us all.
PICARD: I realise that.
K'VADA: Hechu' ghoS. Very well, Captain. We have set a course for
Romulus.
