[Bridge]

WORF: I have made contact, Commander.
RIKER: On screen. I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation
Starship Enterprise.
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Klim Dokachin, Quartermaster, Surplus Depot
Zed One Five.
RIKER: I need some information about a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It was
sent to you a few years ago.
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Did you arrange an appointment? 
RIKER: An appointment? No.
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Then I will be unable to help you. You may
communicate with scheduling.
(transmission ends) 
RIKER: Who does he think he is?
TROI: The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need.
RIKER: Right. Mister Worf re-establish communication.
WORF: Aye, sir.
RIKER: Mister Dokaychin? 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Dokachin. Klim Dokachin.
RIKER: Mister Dokachin, the information I need involves a matter of
major importance to the Federation. I'll need access to your logs, your
files. My people can do the work.
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: I don't allow outsiders into my computer
system..
RIKER: All right, one of your people can do the work.
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: I wish I had the people to spare. but I don't.
RIKER: Well, sir what would you suggest?
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: I don't know. Contact me when you reach orbit.
(transmission ends) 
RIKER: I don't believe this.
TROI: He's king of his particular hill, Commander. You'll have to treat
him that way.
RIKER: Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
(later, Enterprise sails into the spaceship graveyard of the supply
depot, and avid fans play spot the old model ship) 
RIKER: Thank you for coming on board, Mister Dokachin.
GUEST0: Quite a ship you have.
RIKER: We've tied into your computers, if you'd like to access the
files.
GUEST0: I don't usually see them in such good condition. By the time
they get to me, they're always falling apart.
TROI: Mister Dokachin, we must find this ship and you're the only one
who can help us.
GUEST0: Who are you?
TROI: Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor.
GUEST0: He probably figures that we don't get to see a lot of
handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little
more cooperation from me. He's probably right. What was the name of
that ship? The T'Pau? (goes to science station) The T'Pau. Vulcan
registry. There. Logged in stardate 41334.
LAFORGE: Where's the ship now?
GUEST0: Docked. Section eighteen gamma twelve. Do you want me to take
you there?
RIKER: I'd appreciate it.
GUEST0: Helmsman, lay in a heading one four one by two zero eight.
Ahead slow, two hundred kph. I suppose this is your first visit to a
junkyard, isn't it? You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on
board these ships. I once found a fourteen foot Caldorian eel on board
a freighter, in someone's locker.
TROI: Are you serious?
GUEST0: If you have time, I'll show it to you. I still have it.
Nursed her back to health. 
WORF: We are approaching the designated coordinates, Commander.
RIKER: On screen.
(empty space) 
GUEST0: What? Where is it? What happened to it? These are the correct
coordinates.
RIKER: The T'Pau is missing?
GUEST0: The T'Pau is missing.
RIKER: How could a ship disappear from your depot?
GUEST0: I'm not accustomed to losing things, Commander. I will find
your ship for you. I have the T'Pau cross-referenced in four different
directories. 
LAFORGE: When it was brought here was it stripped of material,
armament, sensors?
GUEST0: Of course.
LAFORGE: Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
GUEST0: It was routed to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the outer
rim of the shipyard.
RIKER: It's not there any more. What's left of that deflector is laid
out on the floor of our cargo bay.
GUEST0: How can that be?
RIKER: Perhaps we should to pay a visit to the Tripoli. 
(another short but slow journey) 
GUEST0: In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot,
nothing has ever been lost. Never. 
WORF: Approaching the coordinates of the Tripoli, sir.
RIKER: On screen.
(more empty space) 
GUEST0: I do not understand this. This is not possible. We beam goods
to the Tripoli on a regular schedule. There was
a shipment yesterday. Another is set for today. It must be there.
RIKER: When is today's transport?
GUEST0: Just over two hours from now. A shipment of deuterium storage
tanks.
RIKER: Ensign, align the Enterprise so we appear to be one of the
abandoned ships. Mister La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the
engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.
RIKER: I've a feeling somebody's going to be here to receive those
storage tanks. I'd be very interested to know who that is.
