[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Commander, we've routed the impulse
engines through the plasma conduits, but you'll have to watch the
intercooler levels. If they get too high, we'll blow the entire relay
system. 
RIKER [OC]: Understood. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: I think that's what happened twelve years
ago. The cloak blew out the plasma relays on the Pegasus after we left
the ship. The plasma ignited in space, and it looked as if the ship had
been destroyed. 
PRESSMAN: So the ship drifted into this system still in a phased state,
and when it passed through this asteroid 
RIKER: The cloak failed, and half the ship materialised in solid rock. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge to Bridge. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The cloak is online and ready to begin
phase sequencing. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Proceed, Number One. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. Activating power systems. 
(and the Enterprise vanishes) 
PICARD: Report. 
RIKER: The cloak appears to be functioning normally. The ship's
matter-energy phasing rate should be sufficient to pass through the
asteroid. 
PICARD: Take us out. Manoeuvring thrusters only. 
WORF: Aye, sir. We will reach the rock face in five seconds. 
(there's no thump, just more rock on the viewscreen) 
WORF: We have passed through two kilometres of the asteroid. Now within
one kilometre of the surface. 
RIKER: We're approaching the surface. 
(and the asteroid belt appears) 
WORF: We have cleared the asteroid, Captain. The warbird is off the
port bow. 
RIKER: They're still waiting for us to make up our minds. 
PICARD: Disengage the cloaking device, Commander. 
PRESSMAN: You cannot do that! If the Romulans see us decloak, they'll
know 
PICARD: They'll know the truth, Admiral. Which is what everyone will
know very shortly. Carry out my orders.
(and Enterprise appears beside the green meanie) 
PICARD: Mister Worf, send a message to the warbird. Inform them that
their government will be contacted shortly about this incident. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Admiral, I am hereby charging you with violation of the Treaty
of Algeron. As Captain of the Enterprise, I'm placing you under arrest.
Mister Worf? 
WORF: Admiral, if you will come with me. 
RIKER: Captain, I'll have to be placed under arrest as well. (Picard
nods) Admiral. 
PRESSMAN: I have a lot of friends at Starfleet Command, Captain. 
(Pressman, Riker and Worf leave) 
PICARD: You're going to need them.
