positronic bridge don explain intervals alien does forge detonating

LAFORGE: Computer, initialise the reload circuits. 
COMPUTER: Reload circuits are initialising. 
LAFORGE: Okay. Data? This ought to do it. 
(does something to his positronic net) 
LAFORGE: I don't get it. I don't understand why isn't this working.
Computer, run me a diagnostic on the input polarisers. 
COMPUTER: There is intermittent contact in the input polarisers. 
LAFORGE: Intermittent? 
(Geordi opens the back of Data's head) 
LAFORGE: What? An iron filing. How'd that get in there?

[Cavern]

(Picard picks up Data's head and opens the back,
then uses a piece of metal to do something to the circuits)

WORF: Commander, I have set the photons to fire in
staggered rounds, detonating in ten second intervals. 
RIKER: Very well. Fire when ready. 
WORF: The sequence will be ready to initiate in one minute.

LAFORGE: Computer, run another diagnostic on the
input polarisers. 
COMPUTER: Polariser circuits are functioning. 
LAFORGE: Well, then, that ought to do it. Okay, Data. Come on, now. 
DATA: Torpedoes. Phasing. Alien. I am processing a binary message
entered into my static memory by Captain Picard. Geordi, are we
planning to fire on the alien habitat? 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but 
DATA: It is imperative that we do not. I will explain later. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to Riker. Hold your fire!
