RIKER: Any indication of the probe's energy source,
Data? 
DATA: No, sir. Power emissions do not match any known radiation
patterns. We have not encountered this technology before, sir. 
PICARD: Very well. Isolate the probe and place it in tow. We'll take it
to Science Station four oh two in the Kohlan system. 
WORF: Captain, the probe has begun to move. It is approaching the
Enterprise. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

CRUSHER: There was enough energy in that flash to
overload your optic nerves. It knocked you unconscious. 
LAFORGE: My visor must have filtered it out. 
CRUSHER: Exactly. But there was no apparent retinal damage and the
cornea looks fine. But I'm still waiting for a full
sero-amino readout. I'll call you when it comes in. (to a medtech) I'd
like this done as quickly as possible, Ensign. 
BARCLAY: You shouldn't have to wait too long for the results. 
CRUSHER: What do you mean? 
BARCLAY: Couldn't you use a global mode in your scanner? It would be a
lot faster. 
CRUSHER: That's not possible. We're talking about human cells here, not
isolinear circuits. I think you'd better stick to engineering,
Lieutenant. 
BARCLAY: A cell has a an electromagnetic signature just like a circuit
element does. Theoretically, it should work with just a few
adjustments. I could set it up for you, if you'd like.
