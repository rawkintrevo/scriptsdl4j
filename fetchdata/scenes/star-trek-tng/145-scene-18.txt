DATA: And at this point, the second co-orbital satellite avoids a
collision with the first. 
(Deanna enters) 
LWAXANA: Deanna, darling. Thank the Four Deities you're here. 
TROI: I hope I'm not interrupting. 
PICARD: No, I must, as a matter of fact, be getting back to the Bridge.

DATA: Captain. Perhaps I should remain and further entertain our guest.

LWAXANA: No! I mean, I'm sure you're needed on the Bridge as well. 
PICARD: Well, thank you for a delicious meal. We must do this again
sometime. 
LWAXANA: I know we will. 
(Picard and Data leave) 
LWAXANA: Well, Little One, the Captain is every bit as charming as your
father was.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Data, you will never know just how much I
owe you for that. 
DATA: Indeed, Captain? I know many more interesting anecdotes, sir. For
example, 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: Sir? 
PICARD: Later. 
DATA: Yes, sir.

TROI: Why would you come aboard at a time like
this? 
LWAXANA: I had no choice. I was going to Pacifica, you were going to
Pacifica. 
TROI: Don't be absurd, Mother. You knew what would happen.

TROI: What stage is it in? 
LWAXANA: I have it completely under control. 
TROI: What stage is it in? 
LWAXANA: Well, far enough along for me to enjoy it, Little One. 
TROI: Now I know why you wore that dress. 
LWAXANA: Don't be ridiculous. This simple little dress? Nothing
provocative about it. 
TROI: What are we going to do? 
LWAXANA: I'm going to do the only honourable thing there is to do. And
I'd say your Captain has the inside track. 
TROI: Mother, don't even think it. 
LWAXANA: Why not? He was thinking about it all through dinner.
