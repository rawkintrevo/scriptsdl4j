[Particle fountain laboratory]

LAFORGE: Murphy's team will cover gamma shift from
twenty three hundred to oh seven hundred hours. Okay, Doctor, I've
split the Engineering teams among all the shifts, and if nothing else
goes wrong, that should be enough to help you finish on time. 
FARALLON: With the help of the exocomps, I think we will. 
LAFORGE: Do you think they'll toe the line? 
FARALLON: Don't worry. They know who's in charge. 
(Data beams in) 
DATA: Doctor, I must ask you to stop using the exocomps. 
FARALLON: Why? Is there something wrong with them? 
DATA: No. It is not that. I have reason to believe the exocomps are
alive.

Captain's log, stardate 46316.6. I have summoned
the senior staff in order to discuss Commander Data's theory that the
exocomps are a life form. Doctor Farallon has attended only
reluctantly. 
[Observation lounge]

FARALLON: Captain, I object to being called here.
I'm wasting time that could be better spent elsewhere. 
PICARD: Doctor, I appreciate your time constraints, but recognising new
life, whatever its form, is the principal mission of this vessel.
Please. Now, Mister Data, will you tell us what makes you think that
the exocomps are alive? 
DATA: Sir, when the exocomp left the access tunnel prior to the
explosion, it may have been attempting to save itself from destruction.

FARALLON: Do you have any basis for that conclusion? 
DATA: Yes. When you attempted to override the exocomp and send it back
into the tunnel, it responded by deliberately burning out its control
interface. 
CRUSHER: Deliberately? 
DATA: The computer diagnostic showed that the exocomp disabled its own
interface. 
FARALLON: That could have been nothing more than a malfunction. 
DATA: However, two hours later, when it was aboard the Enterprise and
no longer in danger, it repaired itself. I believe the exocomp was
protecting itself. And if that is true, it has demonstrated an
awareness of its environment, and an ability to adapt to that
environment. 
FARALLON: You're anthropomorphising these units. Like any mechanical
devices, they occasionally malfunction. One time, I saw an exocomp
enter a reaction chamber for no apparent reason and vaporise itself. Is
that supposed to make me think it was depressed and suicidal? 
TROI: Doctor, why is it so difficult for you to accept the fact that
the exocomp could be alive? After all, you're talking to a living
machine right now. 
FARALLON: And I have nothing but the utmost respect and admiration for
Doctor Soong's accomplishment. But his intention was to create an
artificial life form. I created the exocomps to be tools. And there is
a big difference between Data and a tool. 
DATA: Doctor, there is a big difference between you and a virus, but
both are alive. 
PICARD: If the possibility exists, no matter how slight, that these
exocomps are lifeforms, then we must examine that possibility. 
DATA: Thank you, sir. And until we have a definitive answer, I believe
it would be inappropriate to exploit the exocomps as labourers. 
FARALLON: Captain, that's absurd. 
CRUSHER: If they are intelligent life forms, we have no right to force
them to work for us. 
FARALLON: That's like me telling you not to use your tricorder. 
CRUSHER: Tricorders aren't alive. 
FARALLON: Neither are exocomps. 
PICARD: Clearly these are difficult issues to resolve. We have to
proceed very carefully. So the first task is to test Mister Data's
hypothesis. 
LAFORGE: Data, you're claiming that this exocomp may be alive because
it demonstrated survival instincts, right? 
DATA: Yes. 
LAFORGE: Then why don't we just threaten its survival again and see
what happens? 
PICARD: Make it so.
