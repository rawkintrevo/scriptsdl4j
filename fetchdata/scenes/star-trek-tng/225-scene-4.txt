RIKER: Riker to Sickbay. The Captain's hurt. 
(Beverly is scanning Picard) 
CRUSHER: Pulse and blood pressure are normal I'm getting hyperactive
fibrogenic activity. This is odd. 
RIKER: What is it? 
CRUSHER: There's no evidence of any injury or trauma. Vital signs are
normal, but neurotransmitter production is off the scale. What's going
on? 
RIKER: That probe is doing something to him. Anything yet, Data? 
DATA: No, sir. The particle emission is most unusual. I am unable to
block it. 
WORF: We should destroy the probe. Phasers are armed and ready. 
CRUSHER: I don't think that's wise. Not until we know exactly what it's
doing to him. 
RIKER: Agreed. Stand down phasers, Mister Worf. In the meantime, take
us out of range. Ensign. Thrusters only, one hundred kph nice and easy 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
DATA: The probe is moving with us, sir, holding relative position. 
CRUSHER: It's connected itself to him, like a tether.

[Courtyard]

ELINE: You've been dreaming of that starship of
yours again, haven't you? 
PICARD: I'm just charting progress of the course of the sun. It might
give a clue to the cause of this drought. 
ELINE: I think you're still trying to figure out where you are. Where
that ship of yours is. How to get back to that life. 
PICARD: The memory is five years old now, but it's still inside me. 
ELINE: Was your life there so much better than this? So much more
gratifying, so much more fulfilling, that you cling to it with such
stubbornness? 
PICARD: Eline. 
ELINE: It must have been extraordinary. But never in all of the stories
you've told me have you mentioned anyone who loved you as I do. 
PICARD: It was real. It was as real as this is. And you can't expect me
to forget a lifetime spent there. 
ELINE: Yes, I can. I've been patient, Kamin. For five years I've shared
you with that other life. I've listened, I've tried to understand, and
I have waited. When do I get you back? 
PICARD: I know. I know. It has been hard on you. 
ELINE: When will you let go? When will you start living this life? When
will we start a family? 
GUEST4: Kamin, Eline, good morning. 
PICARD: Good morning, Batai. 
GUEST4: Are you ready? The Administrator's already arrived. 
PICARD: Yes. Will you come along? 
ELINE: No, thank you. You do very well on your own. 
GUEST4: She always was strong-minded, even when she was a child. 
PICARD: It's not her fault. These past few years have been very
difficult for her. 
GUEST4: And for you, I think.
