GOWRON KLINGON KAHLESS KOROTH WORF

[Observation lounge]

WORF: It will be glorious! 
GOWRON: It will be war. You are not a fool, Worf. Do you really think
that every Klingon in the Empire will bend his knee and grovel before
this man just because Koroth says he is Kahless? 
WORF: He is Kahless. Your own test proved it. 
GOWRON: I will not hand over the Empire to Koroth because of one test. 
WORF: It is not Koroth, it is 
GOWRON: Of course it is Koroth! Open your eyes. Koroth and the other
Guardians have always opposed me. This is nothing more than a ploy for
them to finally seize power. Even now, there are warriors on my own
ship who want to see Kahless. There are others who believe he is an
imposter. The divisions are already forming. 
WORF: But it does not have to be this way. We could all join together
and welcome Kahless as a united people. 
GOWRON: Don't you see? This is exactly why they want you to join them.
Because your brother sits on the Council and your voice carries weight
in the Empire. They want you to influence others to follow them. Worf,
we fought together once side by side to keep the Empire from being torn
apart. Will you stand by and let these impostors destroy all that we
fought so hard to protect? Renounce him, Worf. Stand with me and we can
hold the Empire together. 
WORF: You do not understand. Kahless is our future. Only with his help
can we revive the pure warriors within ourselves. Listen to him,
Gowron. Open your heart. Hear his words. He will restore your faith as
he has restored mine. Give him a chance to lift your spirit and cleanse
your heart before you take up arms.

GOWRON: Koroth. I see that not all fools die young.

KLINGON: Kahless! 
KOROTH: Kahless, may I present Gowron, Leader of the High Council. 
KLINGON: Kahless. 
(Kahless walks straight to his throne and sits) 
KAHLESS: Long ago, a storm was heading toward the city of Quin'lat. The
people sought protection within the walls. All except one man who
remained outside. I went to him and asked what he was doing. I am not
afraid, he said. I will not hide my face behind stone and mortar. I
will stand before the wind and make it respect me. I honoured his
choice and went inside. The next day, the storm came and the man was
killed. The wind does not respect a fool. Do not stand before the wind,
Gowron. 
GOWRON: What was his name? 
KAHLESS: What? 
GOWRON: If you were really there, you should be able to tell us the
name of the man outside the walls. Describe him to us. What was he
wearing? How tall was he? What colour were his eyes? 
KAHLESS: I do not remember. It was long ago, and in another lifetime.
What matters is, I have returned to restore faith and hope to my
people. To lead them back to the way of honour and the glory that was
once theirs and can be again. Is that what you oppose, Gowron? 
GOWRON: I oppose you. I say you are not Kahless, and I will not bend my
knee to you as long as I can draw a breath or pick up a blade. 
(Gowron draws his dagger, and Kahless comes forward to fight him with
his own dagger) 
KOROTH: No! 
WORF: Koroth! 
(the fight starts) 
KAHLESS: A good try, Gowron, but not enough. 
(another series of thrusts and parries, and Kahless headbuts Gowron,
then laughs) 
KAHLESS: You have no joy, Gowron. Is your heart so filled of distrust
and suspicion that you've forgotten what it is to be truly Klingon? 
(Gowron disarms Kahless and knocks him down. Worf stops Gowron from
killing him) 
GOWRON: Kahless. The greatest warrior of them all.
