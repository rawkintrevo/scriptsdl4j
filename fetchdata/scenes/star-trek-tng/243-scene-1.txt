BAEL GIRAL TOQ WORF

[Compound]

(morning, and a young man is hoeing a vegetable
plot with a long, wicked-looking implement. Worf snatches it from him) 
WORF: This is a gin'tak spear. 
TOQ: What of it? 
WORF: Have your parents taught you nothing? This is used for battle,
not tilling soil. 
TOQ: We have no need for weapons here. The war is far away. 
WORF: What war? 
TOQ: The war our parents came here to escape. 
WORF: That war was over many years ago. 
TOQ: I'm not interested in what you have to say, Klingon. I have work
to do. 
(Worf walks on to another area, where the girl from the pond is
lounging) 
BA'EL: Hello again, Worf. They say you've come to stay with us. 
WORF: Not by choice. 
BA'EL: Aren't you happy to have escaped the war? 
WORF: The war. 
BA'EL: Yes. We've heard the stories all our lives. How people are
slaughtered in terrible battles, forced to fight whether they want to
or not. That's why our parents came here, to make a safe home, a place
where they could raise their children in peace. I should think you'd be
relieved to get away from the fighting. You're safe here. 
WORF: A place can be safe and still be a prison. Where I come from,
people are free to come and go as they choose. 
BA'EL: So are we. 
WORF: Tell your father that you would like to leave. Tell him that you
would like to visit the Klingon Home world. See what he says. 
BA'EL: Why would I want to go there? It's dangerous. 
WORF: Not any longer. 
GI'RAL: Ba'el! Come here! 
BA'EL: Yes, Mother. You are not allowed to leave the compound? Then I
suppose I won't be seeing you at the pond again. 
GI'RAL: I told you not to speak with him. 
BA'EL: I'm sorry, Mother. 
(Worf's homing device starts beeping. He switches it off)
