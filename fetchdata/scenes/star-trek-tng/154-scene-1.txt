[Beach]

(On white sand, by the light of an enormous moon,
Geordi is on a date!) 
LAFORGE: Another Coco-no-no? 
CHRISTY: No thanks, I think I've had enough already. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. Yeah, me too. Oh, I almost forgot. 
(He snaps his fingers, and a gypsy violinist appears and plays while
Geordi makes a very bad attempt at putting his arm around her shoulder)

CHRISTY: Geordi. I'm sorry. I think I'd better go back. 
LAFORGE: Too chilly? I can turn down the breeze. 
CHRISTY: No, it's been a lovely programme. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
CHRISTY: And you're a terrific guy. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
CHRISTY: I just don't feel that way about you. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. (to the gypsy) Knock it off. 
[Ten forward]

(Wesley and Data are playing 3D chess. Outside is a
field of planetary fragments) 
WESLEY: This was the final battle, wasn't it? 
DATA: Neither side intended Orelious Nine to be the decisive conflict. 
WESLEY: There's not much left, is there. 
DATA: The destruction is remarkable considering the primitive weapons
of the period. 
(Geordi enters, disconsolate and back in uniform) 
WESLEY: Uh, oh. 
DATA: I beg your pardon, Wesley? 
WESLEY: Geordi had a big date with Christy tonight. He spent days
putting together the perfect
programme. Looks like it ended kind of early. 
DATA: Uh, oh. 
RIKER [OC]: Commander Data to the Bridge immediately. 
DATA: Acknowledged.
