MARTIN: You would ignore the welfare of the colony
for your own selfish interests. 
HANNAH: The welfare of this colony would be best served by rejoining
the human race. 
MARTIN: She has been contaminated by the people on that ship. 
(Troi and Picard enter) 
TROI: Aaron. 
PICARD: Mister Conor, I believe that you and I should talk. 
MARTIN: This is your doing. We should never have answered your hails. 
HANNAH: If we'd followed that advice, Martin, we'd all be dead by now.
So much for the welfare of this colony. 
MARTIN: You are not taking her with you. 
HANNAH: I'm leaving. And I'll tell you something else. There are at
least a dozen others who are ready to go with me. 
TROI: Hannah, let's allow Aaron and Captain Picard to discuss this. Why
don't we go for a walk? 
HANNAH: There's nothing else for them to talk about. 
(Hannah and Troi leave) 
CONOR: Martin. 
MARTIN: I think it would be helpful if I. 
CONOR: I want to talk with Captain Picard alone. 
MARTIN: But 
CONOR: Thank you, Martin. 
(Martin leaves) 
CONOR: The irony is, he's the one who saw this coming from the moment
you arrived. Because I didn't want to hear it, I chose not to listen. 
PICARD: You made decisions you felt would save your colony. 
CONOR: No. No, I wish it were that simple, but I can't forgive myself
so easily. You see, Captain, I know what Hannah Bates is feeling. I've
been feeling it as well. I've found your people intriguing and
stimulating as she has. I've been every bit as curious about you as the
next man. But I am not the next man. I am the leader of these people.
And every genetic fibre in my being demands that I protect them.
Instead, I have betrayed them. I have allowed this to happen. 
PICARD: We have both allowed this to happen. 
CONOR: Then let us both find a way to stop it from going any further. 
PICARD: I wish I could see a way. 
CONOR: Picard, I was born to govern this colony, not to dismantle it. 
PICARD: If you force them to stay, you will be suppressing their human
rights. 
CONOR: If even a handful leave, the damage to this society will be
devastating. What about the rights of those who would stay behind? They
are the ones who will inherit the social chaos that will follow for
generations. Your arrival created this problem. Your departure solves
it. 
PICARD: That is simplistic. 
CONOR: Refuse them passage. 
PICARD: I cannot ignore the requests of people, humans, who ask for
transport away from here. 
CONOR: Nor can you ignore the fact that thousands will suffer if you
agree to take them. And as suffering grows, more will demand to leave.
We are witnessing the end of this existence. I implore you, Captain, do
not let this happen. 
PICARD: You would have me make the decision for you, nut I can't do
that. I am willing to talk to these people with you, and I will urge
them not to make an impulsive choice, but if finally they choose to
leave, the Enterprise will not turn them away.
