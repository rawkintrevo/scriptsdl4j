WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Try them again. Boost the signal strength. 
WORF: Sheliak Corporate. This is the starship Enterprise. Respond
please. 
(A vaguely humanoid blob appears, looking like lumps of mud) 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Conversation is neither required nor desired. 
PICARD: Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our
mutual problem. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Our involvement in Federation illegality is
not indicated. 
PICARD: Both parties are involved, sir. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Remove the humans from the Tau Cygna system.
Three Earth days remain. 
PICARD: Let us negotiate in good faith. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Negotiate to what purpose? The treaty is
signed. 
PICARD: There is a thriving colony on that planet. Rather than uproot
these people, may I offer a compromise? 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Denied. 
PICARD: Why? 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: The law is paramount. We are entitled. 
PICARD: This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smooth
relations between peoples. Not to act as a strait

PICARD: Jacket.

ARD'RIAN: You really think we'll have to leave Tau
Cygna Five? 
DATA: The possibility does exist, yet Gosheven seems unwilling to
prepare for it. Why? 
ARD'RIAN: Maybe because you're an android. I don't think Gosheven likes
the idea of machines ordering him around. 
DATA: I am not ordering him to do anything. I am merely trying to
persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. Do you believe
my suggested course of action should be followed? 
ARD'RIAN: Of course. 
DATA: In spite of the fact that I am an android? 
ARD'RIAN: Because of that fact. I don't have any silly prejudice
against computers. I like them. Not that any computer we have is half
as sophisticated as you are. 
(Data looks around) 
DATA: No, I would say not. 
ARD'RIAN: People can be selfish, irrational, stubborn, malicious, you
name it. But computers don't have those failings. 
DATA: And you conclude because of this that I am impartial. Hence, you
accept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Commander Data. 
DATA: Data here. 
PICARD [OC]: The Sheliak won't bargain. 
DATA: Understood, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrange
transport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to move
quickly.

DATA: Aye, sir. We must speak to Gosheven
immediately.
