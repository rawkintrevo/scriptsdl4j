[Transporter room]

(another test object comes back almost intact, but
if it were a person, they'd still be dead. Picard enters) 
PICARD: Now, are we progressing, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: About like you'd expect, sir. 
PICARD: Splendid. Splendid. Carry on. 
(Picard leaves) 
WESLEY: He wants the impossible. 
LAFORGE: That's the short definition of Captain.

[Main square]

(A crowd is gathering under the street lights) 
GUEST1: You've all heard of the android Starfleet sent here, and
you've been discussing why he's come.
I've called this meeting to replace misinformation with cold, hard
fact. 
DATA: I wish to speak. 
GUEST1: No. Leave now. 
DATA: Do you consider your position so weak that it cannot withstand
debate? 
GUEST0: Let him talk. 
DATA: You know of the Sheliak threat. Starfleet wishes to evacuate you
for your own protection. Yet Gosheven has decided otherwise. That is
his right, And I will not waste time trying to reverse that decision. I
admire your conviction in the face of certain defeat. Though doomed,
your effort will be valiant. And when you die, you will die for land
and honour. Your children will understand that they are dying for a
worthy cause. Long after the battle is over, their courage will be
remembered and extolled. 
ARD'RIAN: Remembered by who? 
DATA: Yes, that is true. There will be no one left alive to remember. 
GUEST1: (applauding) A valiant try, android, but what a low opinion
you must have of us. 
DATA: I was simply attempting to describe your inevitable destruction
in a manner that would have an emotional effect. 
GUEST0: And he describes it pretty damned well. 
GUEST1: Are you ready to follow this machine? Give up without a
fight? He says we're going to lose, but I think that's just his
cowardice talking! 
GUEST4: What if he's right and you're wrong? Shouldn't we consider that
possibility? 
GUEST1: This colony exists because generations gave their lives for
it. Many people died before we found a way to adapt to the radiation.
And many more died bringing water to the desert. My grandfather 
ARD'RIAN: Is buried on that mountain. Well, who'll be left to bury you?

GUEST1: Have you considered what this evacuation means? Everything we
have, we abandon. Everything that we have
built turns into dust. Everything that we have accomplished means
nothing. Well, I say no. You elected me your leader. Follow me now. I
don't think our chances are as hopeless as he says. And I'm willing to
stake our lives on it. Any objections? Good, because here we stand. 
ALL: Aye, We stand with you. 
(The men slap Gosheven on the back, the women look worried) 
DATA: Then here you die. 
(after the crowd has broken up) 
GUEST0: Mister Data, I just want you to know that Gosheven doesn't
speak for all of us. I see no reason to die needlessly. 
DATA: And you? 
GUEST4: I'm not sure. Gosheven's done well for us, but I'd like to hear
more of what you have to say. 
GUEST0: There are many others that feel the same way but they're very
uneasy about confronting Gosheven. 
ARD'RIAN: Get them together and we'll meet at my house.
