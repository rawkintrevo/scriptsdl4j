OBRIEN WORF PICARD MACET DARO DATA

[Turbolift]

O'BRIEN: Deck six. 
DARO: Deck ten. Your Captain is most impressive. 
O'BRIEN: Yes, he is. 
DARO: Chief O'Brien, our Transporting system is still operating with
active feed pattern buffers. I would like to talk with you about your
technology. 
O'BRIEN: I'll have to get Commander La Forge's approval on that. 
DARO: I understand. In the meantime, we're going to your Ten Forward.
Will you join us? 
O'BRIEN: If my Commander tells me to discuss the Transporter with you,
I will. If Captain Picard orders me to tell you everything I know about
Ben Maxwell, I will. But who I choose to spend my free time with,
that's my business.

DATA: Captain, the Phoenix in Sector twenty one
five oh five. 
PICARD: Ensign, set a course, warp six. Mister Worf, send a message by
subspace. Tell them to prepare for a rendezvous. 
WORF: Yes, Captain. 
MACET: Captain, a suggestion. 
PICARD: Yes? 
MACET: We have a number of ships in sector twenty one five oh five. If
you will give us more precise coordinates and the ship's coded
transponder frequency, we would be able to intercept Maxwell far more
quickly than you. 
PICARD: I'm sure that's true. However, given the circumstances, I would
prefer to make the initial contact myself. I'm sure you would, if the
situation were reversed. 
MACET: Captain, time is crucial. You have a dangerous man out there
with a huge arsenal at his command. If he is intent on revenge against
my people he must be stopped before he can do more damage. 
PICARD: Captain, so far we have an isolated incident. If I can reach
him first, then perhaps diplomacy can prevail.
But if one of your ships decides to retaliate, there is a danger we
could lose control of the situation. 
MACET: Then you will not give us the means to find his precise
location? 
PICARD: No. I won't.
