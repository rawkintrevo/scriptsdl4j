[Vash's room]

PICARD: May I come in? 
VASH: Excuse the mess. Sovak has taken to searching my room
periodically. 
PICARD: Is this what he's looking for? 
(He holds up the disc) 
VASH: I'm sorry I had to hide it like that. I was afraid he'd start
searching me next. 
PICARD: This disc must contain some very valuable information. 
VASH: I doubt it's anything you'd be interested in. 
PICARD: Depends. 
VASH: On what? 
PICARD: On whether or not it has something to do with the Tox Uthat. 
VASH: Did Sovak tell you that? 
PICARD: Well, let's just say I've heard rumours that the Uthat is
located somewhere on Risa. 
VASH: Look, the last thing I need is a partner. 
PICARD: So it's true. 
VASH: Have a seat. I don't suppose you ever heard of Professor Samuel
Estragon? 
PICARD: Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. He spent half his life
searching for the Tox Uthat. 
VASH: I served as his personal assistant for the past five years.
Shortly before he died, he uncovered new data pinpointing its location.
And that disc contains his research notes and maps. 
PICARD: And you're continuing his work? 
VASH: Exactly. 
PICARD: With a Ferengi as an associate? 
VASH: Sovak and I are definitely not working together. 
PICARD: But the two of you are very well acquainted. 
VASH: Well, at times he aided the professor in his explorations.
Especially in situations that weren't quite ethical. 
PICARD: And now, with typical Ferengi logic, he's convinced that the
Tox Uthat belongs to him. 
VASH: All he cares about is selling it to the highest bidder. 
PICARD: Whereas you, of course, have a nobler purpose in mind. 
VASH: I told the professor I'd present it to the Daystrom Institute for
study. But first I have to find it. And that won't be easy with Sovak
watching me every minute. 
PICARD: I'll go in your place. 
VASH: And what about me? 
PICARD: You'll remain here. It's safer. 
VASH: Is that an order? 
PICARD: Absolutely. 
VASH: This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc. I don't follow orders. 
PICARD: Oh, I see. 
VASH: Besides, you'd never find it without me. The professor's notes
are in code. 
PICARD: From the moment I met you, I knew you were going to be trouble.

VASH: You look like a man who could handle trouble. 
PICARD: So, where exactly is the location? 
VASH: It's about twenty seven kilometres due east. There are some
subterranean caves there. That's where you'll find the Uthat. 
PICARD: I'll meet you in the lobby in fifteen minutes. Be punctual. Oh,
and I advise you to change your clothing. 
VASH: Jean-Luc. We're going to make a wonderful team.
