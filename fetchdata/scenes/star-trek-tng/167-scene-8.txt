PICARD TROI VASH WORF RIKER

[Corridor]

RIKER: I do have one request, sir. 
PICARD: You want me to bring you back a souvenir? 
RIKER: It's called a Horga'hn. I don't think you'll have any trouble
finding one. 
PICARD: Consider it done. 
WORF: Captain, I would feel better if you would allow me to assign a
security officer to you. We will be out of communication range when we
leave orbit. 
PICARD: I really don't think that will be necessary, Mister Worf. Risa
has a reputation of being a most peaceful planet. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Well, the ship is yours, Number One. 
TROI: Enjoy your trip, Captain. 
PICARD: I'll try, Counsellor. 
(Picard enters the transporter room) 
RIKER: He's going to have a great time.

[Resort Lobby]

(Picard is looking around when a woman bumps into
him) 
PICARD: I beg your pardon. 
(She sees a Ferengi enter, and throws her arms around Picard's neck) 
VASH: God, it's so good to see you again. 
(She kisses Picard) 
PICARD: I think you've mistaken me for someone else. 
VASH: You know, I think you might be right. Welcome to Risa. 
PICARD: A simple handshake would have sufficed. 
(He walks past the aliens from the opening scene)
