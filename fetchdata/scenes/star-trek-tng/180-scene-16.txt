RIKER WOMAN ISHARA PICARD GUARD OBRIEN GIRL CRUSHER DATA

[Sickbay]

ISHARA: You have Tasha's DNA on file? 
CRUSHER: The ship's computer does. There's always some differentiation
between sonomic chromosomes, but not enough to affect results. It
should take me a few hours to run the sonomic comparison. 
(Crusher leaves) 
ISHARA: That wasn't too bad. So, all that's left of my sister is a file
in a computer. 
DATA: Tasha exists in our memories as well. 
ISHARA: How did she die? 
DATA: Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra Two by a malevolent entity. 
ISHARA: In battle? 
DATA: No. She was killed as a demonstration of the creature's power,
without provocation. 
ISHARA: That's not how I intend to die. 
(Riker enters) 
RIKER: The Captain approves. You're with us.

(Ishara is beamed into a tunnel and immediately the
alarms go off.) 
[Level 3C, 547]

off, leaving just two behind)

GUARD: Come on. 
WOMAN: Josh, you're with us. 
GUARD: Spread out.
