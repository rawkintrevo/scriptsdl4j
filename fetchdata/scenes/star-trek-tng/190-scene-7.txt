[La Forge's quarters]

(Geordi is laying the table for dinner) 
LAFORGE: Okay. Computer, subdued lighting. No, that's too much. I don't
want it dark, I want it cozy. 
COMPUTER: Please state your request in precise candlepower. 
LAFORGE: See, it's not a matter of precision, computer, it's a matter
of mood. Brighter than this. More. More. A little more. Hold. Right
there. Perfect. Now, some music. Maybe a little soft jazz. No, that's
not right. Let me think here. Oh, I got it! Some Brahms! A piano etude.
Nah, that's too corny. Probably everybody thinks of that. Computer,
just give me some guitar. Classical guitar. Doesn't matter who. Yes,
thank you. 
(Doorbell) 
LAFORGE: Come on in. 
(Leah enters) 
LEAH: Oh, you've changed. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. The uniforms are so formal. 
LEAH: You're less formal than any Starfleet officer I've ever met,
Commander. 
LAFORGE: Am I? I really just wanted to make you feel more comfortable. 
LEAH: I'm fine. Thank you. 
LAFORGE: I'm sorry. Come in and have a seat. Can I get you a drink? 
LEAH: No, thank you. 
LAFORGE: You sure? You know, your hair, it's different. 
LEAH: Different than a few hours ago? 
LAFORGE: No, I mean it's different than I expected. Different from your
Starfleet records. 
LEAH: Oh. Yes, I used to wear it up. 
LAFORGE: Yeah. 
LEAH: Why would you need to see my personnel file? 
LAFORGE: Standard procedure when guests come on board. Protocol. I
mean, it was nothing specific, actually. Just, you know. 
LEAH: Commander La Forge, if I seem to be somewhat unyielding in my
views, it's because I care so very much about my work. 
LAFORGE: Oh, I know. 
LEAH: To be honest, people find me cold, cerebral, lacking in humour. 
LAFORGE: But they're wrong, I assure you. 
LEAH: Well, I try not to be that way, but when it comes to my designs,
my engines, especially the ones on the Enterprise. 
LAFORGE: It's like they're your children. 
LEAH: Yes. Exactly. 
LAFORGE: So naturally you're a little possessive about them. 
LEAH: You understand that? 
LAFORGE: Yes, I do. You see, I feel the same way. 
LEAH: That's amazing. I don't think anyone has ever. Sometimes I feel
more comfortable with engine schematics than people. 
LAFORGE: Well, maybe you just haven't met the right people. You hungry?
I'm hungry. Why don't I just start dinner, okay? 
LEAH: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Please, call me Geordi. 
LEAH: I'm sorry, I hope that I didn't put you to a lot of trouble but I
can't stay. 
LAFORGE: You can't? 
LEAH: I just don't think that it's appropriate. 
LAFORGE: Oh. 
LEAH: I'll meet with you at oh eight hundred tomorrow. I'm preparing a
list of discrepancies that I've identified in your modifications. I
hope, now that we've reached an understanding that you'll be prepared
to discuss them with me in a more objective fashion. 
LAFORGE: Sure. Fine. 
LEAH: Thank you. Goodnight, Commander. 
(Leah leaves) 
LAFORGE: Goodnight.
