RIKER RO CRUSHER KRISTIN
47c afraid rules make commander doing good cliffs discuss

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Raise your arm to the side. 
(it barely gets to waist height) 
CRUSHER: Is that it? 
KRISTIN: I'm afraid so. What do you think? 
CRUSHER: Well, it looks like you tucked when you should have flattened
out. 
KRISTIN: Something like that. 
CRUSHER: Turn your head to the left. Some tearing of the ligaments.
Nothing we can't take care of. 
KRISTIN: Good. 
CRUSHER: If I remember correctly, the last time you graced my Sickbay,
you were diving off the Cliffs of Heaven on Sumiko Four. Holodeck
programme 47C. 
KRISTIN: Same thing. Only that time, I flattened out when I should have
tucked. 
CRUSHER: Well, as your Doctor, I would like to recommend the Emerald
Wading Pool on Cirrus Four. It's a lot safer.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Navigators on this ship have been doing
flight handling assessments the same way for years, Ensign. 
RO: And I've found a better way. 
RIKER: Bridge. Do you mind if we discuss changes in procedure before
you make them? 
RO: If I had come to you in advance and asked you to do it my way 
RIKER: I might have said 
RO: No. 
RIKER: Yes, maybe. The point is, I didn't get the chance. 
RO: The point is, with all due respect Commander, you're trying to turn
me into your idea of the model officer. 
RIKER: The rules on this ship do not change just because Ro Laren
decides they do.
