LAVELLE: You think so? 
BEN: Yes, and I'm not going to let you get away with it. 
OGAWA: You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't try so hard with Riker. It
doesn't matter whether he likes you as long as he respects you. 
SITO: He must, otherwise he would not be considering you for the Ops
position. 
LAVELLE: You're probably right. Maybe I'm just telling myself he hates
me so that if I don't get promoted, I'll have an excuse. 
BEN: You in or not? 
TAURIK: At this juncture, the odds of my winning this hand are less
than thirty nine to one. I fold.

[Riker's quarters]

LAFORGE: The Commander's flush is still working. No
help, Worf. Tens and deuces for the Doctor. And Jacks and fours for the
Counsellor. Ah, three sixes. 
WORF: Fold. 
RIKER: Looks like it's just you and me. You going to go another fifty? 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking. Give me a second, here. 
TROI: Didn't you tell me that you took up poker so you could be the
officer's game at the Potemkin? 
RIKER: I happen to like poker. 
TROI: But your senior officers might have thought you were trying to
ingratiate yourself. I guess it's lucky that they realised you were
young and inexperienced, and decided not to hold it against you. 
RIKER: Maybe I have been a little hard on Lavelle. 
WORF: I do not believe he is bluffing. 
LAFORGE: I do. There you go. What've you got? 
WORF: Flush. 
LAFORGE: I can't believe this. 
RIKER: I am your worst nightmare.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(Lavelle has sevens and sixes, and a queen) 
BEN: I knew it. 
LAVELLE: How could you tell I was bluffing? 
BEN: You don't really expect me to answer that, do you? 
SITO: Look, it's getting late. Maybe we should all get some sleep. 
BEN: One more hand. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come on, Geordi. You don't have to quit just
because I'm unbeatable? 
LAFORGE: Nah, there's something I need to do down in Engineering. I'll
get you next time. 
RIKER: I'll be there. 
LAFORGE: Goodnight, everybody. 
TROI + CRUSHER: Goodnight. 
[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

SITO: Bye. 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
OGAWA: See you later. 
(Sito and Ogawa leave) 
TAURIK: What I find curious is that when Commander La Forge saw that
the technique I was using was actually more efficient, he seemed
annoyed. 
BEN: Of course he was. 
LAVELLE: He didn't like the fact that you knew something he didn't. 
TAURIK: Do you think I have irreparably damaged my relationship with
him? 
LAVELLE: It depends on what kind of a guy he is. 
BEN: Ante up, gentlemen. 
(doorbell) LAVELLE: Come in. 
(La Forge enters) 
LAVELLE: Commander. 
LAFORGE: As you were. I just dropped by to see Taurik. 
TAURIK: What can I do for you, sir? 
LAFORGE: Well, I'm headed for Engineering to run those tests on the
nacelles. Since you've already put in some work on the technique, I
thought you might like to give me a hand. 
TAURIK: I'd be pleased to, sir. 
LAFORGE: Great. Let's go. 
(La Forge and Taurik leave) 
BEN: How about some blackjack? 
LAVELLE: I've got to get some sleep so I can be sharp tomorrow. 
BEN: Why? So you can get promoted, have more responsibility, and have
to get to sleep even earlier? 
LAVELLE: Goodnight. 
[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come in. 
CRUSHER: Ben. What are you doing here? 
BEN: I just cleaned out some junior officers and I thought I'd do the
same here. 
RIKER: You're welcome to give it a try. 
TROI: Pull up a chair. 
BEN: Thanks.
