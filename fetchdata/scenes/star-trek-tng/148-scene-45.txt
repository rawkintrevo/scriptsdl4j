RIKER PICARD TROI PULASKI ARMUS DATA

[The Last Outpost]

(The Ferengis are watching them. Little crouching
men with whips in their hands) 
RIKER: Who are you? 
(The Ferengi let fly energy bolts from their whips, knocking the three
men out. Actually, it takes two jolts to knock out Riker)

[Skin of Evil]

(Riker is grabbed by an invisible force and dragged
by the feet to the slick) 
RIKER: Help! Data, something's got me! 
ARMUS: Touch him and he dies. 
RIKER: No! No, don't! 
(Riker disappears into the slick) 
DATA: Enterprise?

[Bridge]

DATA [OC]: Armus has enveloped Commander Riker. 
PICARD: I'm beaming you up. 
[Planet surface]

ARMUS: If any of you leave now, he dies. 
[Bridge]

ARMUS [OC]: And so do the survivors of the crash. 
(Riker's screaming face appears in the slick, and sinks away again) 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: The growth rate's down to seven percent.
The organisms are still impairing his neural functions.
Respiration's erratic, pulse grossly irregular, blood pressure almost
nil. Tricordrazine. 
TROI: Can we tighten the pattern further?
