  [Crusher's
quarters]

(Beverly has just got home, and is not in a good
mood. Then the doorbell chimes.) 
CRUSHER: All right, come in. 
(Guinan enters, holding her left arm) 
CRUSHER: Guinan? What's wrong? 
GUINAN: I need a doctor. Geordi beat me in straight sets today. I think
I've developed tennis elbow. 
CRUSHER: Well, you'd better go to Sickbay. I think Doctor Selar's on
duty. 
GUINAN: I don't want to see Doctor Selar. I always see you. I'm very
particular about my doctors. 
CRUSHER: Well, you'd better get a new one, because I'm not a doctor on
this ship anymore. 
(after the titles, Beverly has changed into civilian clothes) 
CRUSHER: Three days on a shuttle to Starbase twenty three, transport
back to Earth. I can hear Admiral Brooks now, telling me how I've
disgraced Starfleet Medical. Then a leisurely day and a half before the
formal inquiry begins and my career ends. 
GUINAN: Beverly? My elbow. 
CRUSHER: Your elbow. Let me see it. Does this hurt? 
GUINAN: Ow! Yes, right there. 
CRUSHER: That's tennis elbow, all right. Here, hold your arm like this.

GUINAN: You know, I've never been to a formal inquiry. 
CRUSHER: Well I'll see if I can arrange one for you. All you have to do
is disobey orders, violate medical ethics, and cause an interstellar
incident. 
GUINAN: Well I guess that would do it. 
(Beverly treats the elbow) 
CRUSHER: Make a fist. 
GUINAN: Do I have to hit you with my fist before you tell me what
happened? 
CRUSHER: It all started when those scientists came on board. No. It
started when I got curious. 
GUINAN: Well, there's nothing wrong with that. 
CRUSHER: That's why I went to the Altine Conference. I'd heard about a
new subspace technology developed by a Ferengi, a Doctor Reyga. 
GUINAN: A Ferengi scientist. Hmm. 
CRUSHER: His invention was based on metaphasic fields, but his
methodology was completely unorthodox. 
GUINAN: I like unorthodox. 
CRUSHER: Too bad you weren't there. Nobody else would listen to him.
They all but jeered him off the stage. But I had read his paper and his
work was extraordinary. 
GUINAN: So you gathered all these scientists to come hear this Ferengi.

CRUSHER: Yes. I hoped I could be a facilitator. I thought if I invited
scientists from various cultures to board the Enterprise, I could sit
them and down help them understand the value of his ideas. 
GUINAN: Like a scientific diplomat. 
CRUSHER: Exactly. So, after persuading the Captain, I had to round up
as many scientists as I could from the field of subspace technology.
