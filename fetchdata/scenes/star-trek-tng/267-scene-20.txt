TROI BEN LAFORGE WORF SITO RIKER TAURIK LAVELLE OGAWA CRUSHER

[Shuttlebay] 
(Taurik is firing a laser rifle at shuttlecraft
Curie from the gantry) 
LAFORGE: Another two seconds. Okay, that's enough. 
TAURIK: Sir, I'm a little puzzled. Why are we intentionally damaging
the shuttlecraft? 
LAFORGE: We're evaluating hull resiliency. Starfleet requires periodic
testing. 
TAURIK: I see. I don't believe I'm familiar with that requirement. 
LAFORGE: Probably because you're not a senior officer. 
TAURIK: If you wish, I could reconfigure the phaser to fire a low
intensity burst that would not harm the shuttle's hull. The test
procedure would not be affected. 
LAFORGE: It's fine the way it is. Now, give me another burst, about
four seconds, right here. 
TAURIK: Do you want me to fire from this position? 
LAFORGE: Actually, why don't you do it from over here. 
TAURIK: That would be consistent. 
LAFORGE: Consistent with what? 
TAURIK: With making it appear that this shuttle had fled an attack. 
LAFORGE: What makes you think that's what we're doing? 
TAURIK: The pattern of fire you have asked for is similar to what might
result if the shuttle had fled an attacker while engaging in evasive
manoeuvres. 
LAFORGE: It's an amazing coincidence. 
TAURIK: Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we proceed with the testing? 
LAFORGE: Yes, Ensign. Thank you.

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Alyssa, thank you for coming so quickly.
We have to prepare for surgery. We have a comatose patient with a
subdural hematoma. 
OGAWA: Yes, sir. 
CRUSHER: I want to make it clear that you are not to discuss what you
see here with anyone. 
OGAWA: I understand. 
(their patient is a spoon-head) 
CRUSHER: We'll need to synthesise at least a litre of Cardassian blood.

[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

(five card stud game in progress) 
BEN: It's your bet, Taurik. What I can't understand is why we're just
sitting here so close to the Cardassian border. 
LAVELLE: It must have something to do with that escape pod we picked
up. Don't you think, Sito? 
SITO: Maybe. 
LAVELLE: I wonder who was in it? 
BEN: You know what I heard? It was Ambassador Spock. 
TAURIK: That is most unlikely. 
BEN: That's what I was told. 
TAURIK: By whom? 
BEN: I can't say. 
LAVELLE: They beamed whoever was in it right to Sickbay. Did you see
anything when you went down there? 
OGAWA: No. Doctor Crusher just asked me to help her with the laboratory
schedule. 
TAURIK: I thought Lieutenant Powell was going to join us tonight? 
OGAWA: He had to do a double shift. 
LAVELLE: That's too bad. He must be the worst poker player I've ever
met. 
BEN: It's your bet, Sam. 
(with four clubs showing, Lavelle checks his hole card and grins)

[Riker's quarters]

(another poker game) 
WORF: Twenty. 
CRUSHER: The thing is, I saw Powell in Ten Forward with another woman,
and the way they were talking it made me wonder. 
TROI: Well, if he's seeing someone else he should tell Alyssa. I mean,
it might hurt her now, but it would be better in the long run. 
RIKER: I've been meaning to talk to you about something, Mister Worf. I
don't think Ensign Sito's prepared for the Ops position. 
WORF: Well, I must say I disagree, sir. 
LAFORGE: Counsellor. Pair of fours bets. 
RIKER: I'm listening. 
[Lavelle + Taurik's quarters]

BEN: The bet is fifty. 
TAURIK: It would be illogical for the Captain to deny you a promotion
for something you did as a cadet. 
SITO: He said it shows I don't have character. 
OGAWA: What did you say? 
SITO: What could I say? Maybe he's right. 
LAVELLE: Hey, you're a damn fine officer and you deserve that post as
much as anyone. One thing's for sure, I won't be getting it. Not if
it's up to Riker.

[Riker's quarters]

WORF: It is your decision, sir, but I am certain if
you give Ensign Sito a chance to prove herself, she will not disappoint
you. 
RIKER: Very well, I'll take her under consideration. Besides, I'm not
convinced about Lavelle. 
TROI: Really? Why? 
RIKER: He's too eager to please. He's always trying to ingratiate
himself to me. 
TROI: Why assume he's doing it that to get the job? 
LAFORGE: Fifty. 
RIKER: There's your fifty, and one hundred more. 
TROI: I don't know. It seems to me that you and Lavelle are a lot
alike. 
RIKER: What? We're not at all alike. 
LAFORGE: You're bluffing.
