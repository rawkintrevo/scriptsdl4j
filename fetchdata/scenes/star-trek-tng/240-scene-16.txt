[Warbird - Troi's quarters]

TROI: We have to get a message to the Enterprise. 
N'VEK: That's impossible. 
TROI: It's the perfect opportunity. The Enterprise is nearby. If we can
communicate with them, they might be able to help us. 
N'VEK: Counsellor, this ship is travelling under cloak. All of our
electromagnetic emissions are being monitored. Any attempt at
communication whatsoever and we would be discovered instantly. It could
not succeed. We must continue to Draken Four. That is the safest
course. 
TROI: Is there anything you can do to the ship or to the cloaking
device that would let the Enterprise track us? 
N'VEK: Track us? No. We want to get into Federation territory
undetected. 
TROI: What we want is to get the dissidents to safety. Now answer the
question. Is there a way? 
N'VEK: If there were, I wouldn't do it. 
TROI: Yes, you will. 
N'VEK: Counsellor. 
TROI: We're not playing it your way any more, N'Vek. I've been
kidnapped, surgically altered, put in danger I've gone along with all
your plans. Now you are going to listen to me. You find a way to let
the Enterprise track us, or I will go to Toreth and tell her I've
discovered you're a traitor. I'll order you ejected into space. Is that
clear, Subcommander? 
N'VEK: There is one possibility. In order for a ship to remain
undetectable while cloaked, the radiative emissions from the warp
engines must be precisely balanced. The ship's Engineer is a
sympathiser. He may be able to slightly misalign one of the nullifier
cores. It would create a small magnetic disturbance in space whenever
we were in motion. 
TROI: Good. Do it. 
N'VEK: The effect would only be intermittently. They might not even
detect it. 
TROI: If it's the best we can do, we have to try it. 
N'VEK: Anything more would be immediately registered on the Bridge.
Even this slight misalignment may be detected. 
TROI: It's a risk we have to take. You're the one who outlined the
stakes to me, N'Vek. Are you getting squeamish now, just because things
are getting a little more dangerous?

DATA: Sensors are picking up a polarised magnetic
distortion to our port side. 
PICARD: Analysis. 
DATA: The distortion is extremely weak, sir. It appears to be moving
slowly. It is gone, sir. 
RIKER: Gone? 
DATA: The distortion no longer registers on our instruments. 
PICARD: Could this distortion be caused by a cloaked ship? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. Our understanding of Romulan technology is still
limited. 
DESEVE: Captain, Romulan ships use a forced quantum singularity as a
power source. If that system is not functioning
perfectly or is damaged even slightly, it might show through the cloak
as a magnetic disturbance of some kind. 
DATA: The distortion has reappeared, sir, bearing three three seven
mark ten. It has disappeared again, sir. 
PICARD: Mister DeSeve, in your opinion is it possible that we're
picking up a cloaked Romulan ship? 
DESEVE: It's a strong possibility, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Data, continue your scan. Ensign, link navigational
control to Mister Data's console and plot a course for that distortion.

PILOT: Commander, the Enterprise is underway. 
TORETH: Good. What is their course? 
PILOT: They're heading for us, sir. 
TORETH: What? 
PILOT: They appear to be on an intercept course. 
TORETH: What is the status of our cloaking device? Is there a
malfunction of any kind? 
PILOT: Cloaking device functioning correctly, sir. All shipboard
emissions within normal range. 
TORETH: Maintain full sensor scans. 
N'VEK: Commander. The Enterprise may simply be engaged in search
operations. 
TORETH: Perhaps.
