RIKER LAFORGE WORF TASHA PICARD TROI ZORN SECURITY DATA

[Bridge]

PICARD: Are you certain? 
ZORN [OC]: I promise you, Captain. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: We were making an empty threat. I wanted your
cooperation. Forgive me. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Definitely entering orbital trajectory, sir. 
SECURITY: (at Tasha's station) It measures twelve times our volume,
Captain. 
(A purple light envelopes the Enterprise) 
WORF: Sensors say we were just scanned, sir.

[Passageway]

TASHA: Pain again? 
RIKER: Troi, you've been at it enough. 
TROI: No, I feel close to an answer of some kind. 
DATA: Commander, something down here is shielding our communicators. 
TROI: Yes, that's exactly the feeling I've been reading. As if someone
doesn't want us to be in touch with our ship. 
RIKER: Come on, let's get to the surface.

[Bridge]

WORF: There is no computer record of any such
vessel, sir. Nothing even close. 
SECURITY: Still no response, sir. We've done everything but threaten
them. 
PICARD: Sensor scans, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Our sensor signals seem to just bounce off. Something's
happening, sir. They're firing on Farpoint, sir! 
PICARD: Bring photon torpedoes to ready! 
WORF: Wait, sir. They're hitting the old Bandi city, not Farpoint
Station. 
(The ruined and empty city is being smashed by purple blasts) 
[Passageway]

(The away team can hear the blasts) 
TROI: Those stairs are where we entered down here, sir. 
LAFORGE: At this point, it becomes ordinary stone, sir. Matching what's
above. 
TASHA: My God! Was that a phaser blast? 
DATA: Negative. But something similar. 
RIKER: You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam up to the ship. Now, come on, I
want to see exactly what's happening. 
TROI: Don't. If you should be hurt 
RIKER: You have your orders, Lieutenant. Carry them out. 
TROI: Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir. Enterprise, three to beam up. 
[Zorn's office]

ZORN: Enterprise, Enterprise, come in! Help us,
please! What shall we do?
