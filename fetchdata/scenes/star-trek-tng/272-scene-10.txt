[Village]

PICARD: Mister Worf, what is going on? 
WORF: We have unwelcome visitors, sir. 
(the Cardassians have arrived) 
PICARD: I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. 
GUL EVEK: I am Gul Evek. What are all these people still doing here?
The evacuation should be well underway by now. 
PICARD: May I have a word with you, alone? 
GUL EVEK: As you wish. Wait here. 
PICARD: It was my understanding that there would be no Cardassian
presence here for another six weeks. Your arrival here may have upset
some very delicate negotiations. 
GUL EVEK: Negotiations? The status of this planet has been settled.
What are you negotiating? 
PICARD: I would be very happy to explain that to you, but for now I
must ask you and your men to leave immediately. 
GUL EVEK: Captain, we have been sent here to perform a preliminary
survey of all the buildings and equipment being left behind. I have no
intention of leaving until our mission is complete. 
PICARD: Very well. Complete your mission. But remember, this is
Federation territory, Gul Evek, and until that changes, these people
are under my jurisdiction and I will protect them. 
GUL EVEK: Is that a threat? 
PICARD: It's a fact. Bear that in mind while you conduct your survey.

[Habak]

(entered by a ladder through a hole in the floor) 
LAKANTA: This is the Habak, the focal point of our lives. Strangers are
not welcome here. 
WESLEY: When I asked to come here, you said it would be 
LAKANTA: You're not a stranger. I told you, I've seen you here before. 
WESLEY: What are those figures? 
LAKANTA: They are Mansara. Dolls that represent the different spirits
that come to this place. 
WESLEY: This one looks like a Klingon. 
LAKANTA: Yes. Our culture is rooted in the past, but it's not limited
to the past. 
(He scatters sand around the fire) 
LAKANTA: The spirits of the Klingon, the Vulcan, the Ferengi come to us
just as the bear and the coyote and the parrot. There's no difference. 
WESLEY: What should I do? 
LAKANTA: Start the fire. Then sit and wait. 
WESLEY: What am I waiting for? 
LAKANTA: This is your journey, Wesley. I can open the door, but only
you can go through it.
