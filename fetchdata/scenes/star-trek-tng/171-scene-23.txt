PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA SAREK

[Picard's quarters]

CRUSHER: I can't say I approve of this, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: I didn't expect that you would, Beverly. 
CRUSHER: I don't suppose I could talk you out of it? 
PICARD: I'm afraid not, though I do admit to a certain trepidation.
Your company is much appreciated. 
(doorbell chime) 
PICARD: Come. 
SAREK: I see that you are ready, Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher will monitor our responses. 
SAREK: A sensible precaution. 
(They sit on opposite sides of a small table, then Sarek reaches across
to Picard in the time-honoured fashion) 
SAREK: My mind to your mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Commander, the Legarans are ready to beam
aboard. 
RIKER: Very well. 
SAREK: Number One, please inform the Legaran delegation that Sarek of
Vulcan is on his way to welcome them. 
RIKER: Yes, Ambassador.

[Corridor]

RIKER: I take it the mind-meld was a success? 
SAREK: Yes. All went as planned. 
RIKER: Is Captain Picard all right? 
SAREK: Don't worry, Number One. 
RIKER: And the Ambassador? 
SAREK: I am myself again. It has been a long time.
