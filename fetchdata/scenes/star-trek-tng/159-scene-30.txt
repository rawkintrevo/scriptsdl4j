TROI OBRIEN WORF PICARD RIKER SECURITY DATA

[Brig]

(Both arms are out) 
TROI: Roga, don't! You'll be killed!
(The security guards draw their phasers, there's a big flash) 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: What the hell? 
(The brig is empty. Roga Danar has gone) 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Security personnel, full alert. Shut down
all shuttlebays, transporters, and turbolifts. 
WORF [OC]: Captain, a phaser is missing.

[Brig]

WORF: We must assume that he is armed.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Sound general quarters. Clear corridors of
all non-essential personnel. I don't want him taking any hostages. 
DATA: General quarters sounded, sir. 
PICARD: Raise security containment fields immediately on decks thirty
four, thirty five, and thirty six. 
SECURITY [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Data, put the turbolifts back online. If Danar sees they're
operating, he may try to use them. Soon as he does, we have him. 
[Corridor]

(Danar sees a guard around the next corner. He
ducks into a turbolift - 12 on the door) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Sir, unauthorised access of turbolift five on
deck thirty four. 
RIKER: He took the bait. 
PICARD: Data, override its destination. Divert that turbolift to a
position near Lieutenant Worf's present location. 
DATA: Four seconds to arrival, sir. 
[Corridor]

WORF: We're in position. 
(The turbolift door opens and there a high-pitched whining, but no
person) 
WORF: Phaser on overload! Seal this deck. 
(Worf steps into the lift to deactivate the phaser)
