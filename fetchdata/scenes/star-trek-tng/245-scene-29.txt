RIKER [OC]: Riker to Daren.

RIKER [OC]: You've got less than nine minutes before the storm reaches
the northern perimeter. 
NELLA: I'm here with team six. We're just about to bring the deflectors
online. 
RIKER [OC]: Whenever you're ready. 
NELLA: Daren to perimeter team. Stand by to cross connect deflectors. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Standing by.

CRUSHER [OC]: A hundred colonists down there. 
PICARD: Understood. 
NELLA [OC]: Daren to Commander Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. Go ahead. 
NELLA [OC]: We've got a problem. We're having trouble keeping the
deflectors cross connected. So the only way this is going to work is if
we calibrate them manually. 
RIKER [OC]: If you stay with the deflectors, will they protect you when
the storm hits?
NELLA [OC]: I don't know, sir. For a few minutes maybe. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker. How many more colonists do you have
to transport? 
RIKER [OC]: Seventy three, sir. 
PICARD: How long do you need? 
RIKER [OC]: At least ten more minutes. 
WORF: Captain, the storm will reach the northern perimeter in four
minutes. 
PICARD: Picard to perimeter teams.

PICARD [OC]: It is imperative that you hold your
position until we finish evacuating the colony. Picard out.
