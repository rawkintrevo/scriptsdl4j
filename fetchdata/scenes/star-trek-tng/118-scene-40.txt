[First Unit]

RADUE: Before we begin, Captain, you must speak
with the children. It seems they are on some sort of strike. I don't
understand it. You must deal with this, Captain. I'm not very good with
children. 
PICARD: Strike? I'll see what I can do.

[Wesley's room]

WESLEY: I'm sure if we just stick together, guys,
we'll all be 
(Picard beams in) 
KATIE: Hi, Captain Picard. 
HARRY: Hi, Captain. 
WESLEY: Sir, I knew you'd come. 
PICARD: It's not over yet, Wesley. 
WESLEY: I think I figured out their computer controls, sir, but I'm not
sure. It's a much different system than ours. 
PICARD: Good, Wesley. Now 
HARRY: Captain. 
PICARD: Yes, Harry. 
HARRY: If something happens and you have to leave us here, will you
tell my Dad that I'm sorry that I made him angry, and that I miss him. 
PICARD: You will tell him that, Harry, and I will tell him how much I
admire his son. Hello, Alexandra. 
ALEXANDRA: (Arms open for picking up) Hi. 
(So he does, uncomfortably, while she hangs on to her pet tribble. Did
I mention that before?)

[First Unit]

(The children and Picard beam in) 
RADUE: What is this? 
PICARD: They want to go home. 
RADUE: No. They're staying. 
PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: We're in position. 
PICARD: Hold for orders. 
CRUSHER: The radiation levels on Aldea have been building up over a
long period of time. It is similar to what was experienced on Earth in
the twenty-first century. When the ozone layer had deteriorated and the
surface of the planet was flooded with ultraviolet radiation. 
PICARD: The shield that protected your world in one way is weakening it
in another. It is the radiation of your own sun that is destroying you.

RADUE: You're trying to confuse the issue. 
CRUSHER: Please, listen. You're all suffering from radiation poisoning.
Sterility is only the latest symptom. If the children remain, they will
be affected as well. 
RADUE: It's impossible. Our scientists would have known. 
CRUSHER: How could they? Your scientists have forgotten how everything
works. 
RADUE: No. All lies. 
RASHELLA: No. Wait. Don't send them back yet. What if they're right?
Instead of the children being our hope, what if we're just
condemning them to our fate? 
RADUE: Rashella, they're just protecting their own interests. 
RASHELLA: As are we. But hear them out. The Captain and Doctor Crusher
are saying that the very thing which has given us this wonderful world
is what has caused this tragedy. 
PICARD: That's it, exactly. Your Custodian has controlled you so
completely you've lost even the desire to even question it. 
RADUE: Lies, and the discussion is over. 
(He tries his arm device, but nothing happens) 
PICARD: Commander Riker. 
RIKER [OC]: Here, sir. 
PICARD: I assume you have control of the computer. 
RIKER [OC]: We've disabled the system temporarily. 
[Custodian room]

RIKER: We found the power source to the shield and
we've neutralised it. 
[First Unit]

PICARD: Good. Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam the
children up. 
HARRY: Wait. 
PICARD: Enterprise, hold. 
HARRY: Thank you. 
ACCOLAN: Let me get the dolphin for you to take with you. 
HARRY: No, you keep it. I'll make another one. 
PICARD: All right, Harry? 
HARRY: Yes, Captain. 
WESLEY: Okay, kids. Let's go home.
PICARD: Beam them up. 
(The children are beamed up) 
RADUE: You have destroyed us. 
PICARD: We are not here to destroy you, Radue. We can help you.

[Power room]

(It's massive. On Forbidden Planet scale) 
RADUE: What is it? 
PICARD: A legacy of your Progenitors, Radue. The source of your power
and of your problems. 
DATA: It is reading incredible amounts of energy, sir. Even more since
we have taken down the shield. 
RASHELLA: What are we going to do with it? 
RADUE: Learn, all over again. All this time we've been destroying
ourselves, so sure of our technological invulnerability. Now we must
learn to use this power safely. 
PICARD: Will you let us help you? 
RADUE: Yes. Please.
