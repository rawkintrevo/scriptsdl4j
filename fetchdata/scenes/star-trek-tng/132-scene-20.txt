RIKER: Standard orbit. 
WORF: Captain, I'm reading laser activity on the Solais Five. 
RIKER: How concentrated is the activity? 
WORF: It is localised, but very intense. 
RIKER: So much for the cease fire. 
PICARD: Hailing frequencies. 
WORF: I'm receiving one side only. 
PICARD: This is Captain Jean Luc Picard, commander of the Federation
starship USS Enterprise. If you continue to violate the cease fire, I
will abort this mission. 
(The viewscreen image has lots of interference.) 
ALIEN 1 [on viewscreen]: You have no jurisdiction here, Picard. Where
is Riva? 
PICARD: Riva is in charge of the summit. I command the ship that brings
him. I will not endanger this ship under any circumstances. 
WORF: The other faction is breaking through, sir. 
ALIEN 2 [on viewscreen]: Riva gave his word we would speak to no one
else. Now who breaks the rules? Where is Riva? 
PICARD: I shall summon him for you. Get Riva here. 
[Guest quarters]

RIKER [OC]: Counsellor Troi, please have Riva
report to the Bridge. 
TROI: They need you on the Bridge, now.

[Bridge]

(Troi, Riva and the whole Chorus enter) 
PICARD: The cease fire has been broken. 
SCHOLAR: I'm sure I can resolve that. Put them on the viewscreen. 
PICARD: Viewer on. 
WORF: The quality of the transmission is very poor. 
SCHOLAR: It is sufficient. 
ADONIS: Brothers. Your bravery as fighters is known. Now you must
demonstrate courage in a new way. Cease hostilities. Allow us to meet. 
WORF: The laser fire has ceased. 
RIKER: For how long? These Solari don't seem likely candidates for
peace. 
SCHOLAR: I will need to see a topographical overlay of the battle area
in order to pick a site for the meetings. Then I will need your help in
creating the proper setting. 
RIKER: Worf, prepare your security team. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
ADONIS: That's not necessary. 
RIKER: But it is prudent. 
ADONIS: I prefer to arrive with the smallest possible complement. We do
not want to add to an already tense situation. 
PICARD: If that is your judgement, so be it. We are here to provide
whatever service you require. 
ADONIS: Thank you, Captain. 
(At an aft station, looking at a map) 
SCHOLAR: There. beam us down to that hilltop and inform the factions to
join us. The time for killing is come to an end.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Phasers on stun, Mister Worf. 
SCHOLAR: You won't need those. 
RIKER: I'm sure we won't. Energise. 
(O'Brien beams the six away) 
[Hilltop]

(A flat area with the top of the mountain forming a
back wall. It's windy and desolate.)
SCHOLAR: Yes, this will do. It is important that we set this up
properly. Commander. If it be possible, I would like torches here and
here. 
RIKER: Engineering.
