[Observation Lounge]

RIKER: Captain, allow me to present Special
Federation Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc Picard. This is Counsellor Troi,
Lieutenant Commander Data, and this is Lieutenant 
K'EHLEYR: Worf. So this is where you've been hiding. I told you we'd
meet again. Aren't you going to greet me? 
WORF: I have nothing to say to you. 
K'EHLEYR: Haven't changed a bit. Well, I missed you, too. Two days ago,
Starbase Three Three Six received an automated transmission from a
Klingon ship, the T'Ong.
That ship was sent out over seventy five years ago. 
RIKER: When the Federation and the Klingon Empire were still at war. 
K'EHLEYR: The message was directed to the Klingon High Command. It said
only that the ship was returning home and was about to reach its
awakening point. 
PICARD: Which suggests that the crew had been in cryogenic sleep for
that long journey. 
K'EHLEYR: Exactly. 
RIKER: And when this crew is revived? 
K'EHLEYR: We'll have a ship full of Klingons who think the war is still
going on. 
PICARD: So our task is to find the ship, and tell the Klingons they're
no longer at war. 
RIKER: Why us? Wouldn't a Klingon ship be a better choice? 
K'EHLEYR: A Klingon ship, the P'rang, is on its way, but it's two days
behind us. That may be too late. 
TROI: Why too late? 
RIKER: When the T'Ong crew awakens it will be within striking range of
several Federation outposts. 
DATA: There are thirteen colonies with minimal defences in that sector.

K'EHLEYR: Nice, ripe targets for a Klingon warship. 
TROI: And you believe you can convince these Klingons that the humans
are now their allies? 
K'EHLEYR: No, not a chance. If you ask me, talking will be a waste of
time. Klingons of that era were raised to despise humans. We'll try
diplomacy. But I promise you it won't work. And then you'll have to
destroy them. 
PICARD: No. 
K'EHLEYR: No. Captain, these Klingons are killers. You'll have no
choice. 
PICARD: We shall find another choice. I want options and I want them
before we encounter the Klingon ship. Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
help the Emissary. Dismissed. 
TROI: I will escort you to the guest quarters. 
K'EHLEYR: Captain. 
(All leave except Picard and Worf) 
PICARD: Lieutenant? 
WORF: Sir. I suggest Commander Riker or Data would better serve Special
Emissary K'Ehleyr. 
PICARD: Are there any personal reasons you don't want the assignment? 
WORF: Yes. 
PICARD: Any professional reasons? 
WORF: No. (Picard's left eyebrow raises slightly) I withdraw my
request, Captain. 
PICARD: Good.
