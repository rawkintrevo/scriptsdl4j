[Riker's room]

PICARD: We don't have much time. It's good to see
you, Will. I didn't expect to meet you here. 
RIKER: I was looking to find the people who killed you on the surface.
A witness said they saw you vaporised. 
PICARD: These mercenaries use weapons that can activate their
transporter. It gives them the opportunity to beam things quickly, just
by firing at them. That's what they did to me. 
RIKER: I don't understand any of this. Who are these people? What are
you doing involved with them? 
PICARD: The site that I wanted to study had been raided. A lot of the
artefacts had been stolen. The site had been practically destroyed. I
wanted to find out who was responsible. I tracked them to that bar on
Dessica Two. I must have asked too many questions. They captured me.
They wanted to find out how much I knew about their operation. 
RIKER: And then you became part of their crew? 
PICARD: I convinced them I was a smuggler, and that my name was Galen.
I offered to help them appraise the artefacts that they had stolen.
Will, these aren't common thieves. They are stealing Romulan artefacts
from archaeological sites throughout this sector. Baran has me
analysing each one if them for a particular particle signature. Will,
they are looking for a specific artefact. 
RIKER: Why? 
PICARD: That's what we have to find out. Baran is the key. I think that
he knows more about what we're really looking for than anyone else on
this ship. I want you to get close to him. Try and get his confidence. 
RIKER: That's why you set up the engine failure, because you knew that
I'd be able to fix it. 
PICARD: He also believes that you're a less than perfect Starfleet
officer. Will, I want you to play into that role. Baran and I, well, he
doesn't care very much for me, but he has to tolerate me because he
needs my help with these artefacts. But if you and I become enemies,
then there's a better chance of you and he becoming friends. 
RIKER: All right. I'll do what I can. 
(Baran enters, Picard hits Riker) 
BARAN: What are you doing here? 
PICARD: Getting some answers, because you can't get him to talk. 
(Baran punishes Picard) 
BARAN: No one conducts an interrogation on this ship without my
permission. Is that understood? 
(Picard walks to the door, keeping eye contact with Baran all the time,
and kicks Riker for good measure)
