PICARD JONO

[Guest quarters]

(Jono is still keening) 
PICARD: Jono! Jono, why do you make that noise? 
JONO: It is the custom of my people when we are in distress. 
PICARD: Is it not also the custom of your people to listen to the
wishes of their Captain? 
JONO: Yes. 
PICARD: Then, as Captain of the starship Enterprise, I ask you not to
make that sound. 
JONO: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: Good. Well, now that's cleared up, let's, er, let's, er, let's
get acquainted, shall we? What do you think of your room? I know it's a
little sterile. But if there's anything you'd like? Pictures, perhaps,
or games. 
JONO: This is a cage. I am still your captive. 
PICARD: Oh, no, not at all. I thought you'd be comfortable here. 
JONO: Are you going to return me to my Captain? 
PICARD: We will rendezvous with the warship Q'Maire at oh seven forty
hours. We will transfer the Talarians to Captain Endar. 
JONO: Including me? 
PICARD: We'll discuss your situation with Captain Endar. 
JONO: I don't like this place. 
PICARD: We could find some other quarters. 
JONO: I've always lived with my Captain. 
PICARD: Ah. Yes, well, that wouldn't work here.

[Picard's quarters]

PICARD: Well, I'm sure you'll see there's nothing
here to appeal to a young person. 
(Jono picks up an ornate dagger in a scabbard from the desk) 
PICARD: Put that down, please. 
JONO: It's Klingon. 
PICARD: Yes. Would you put it back where you got it. 
(Jono wrenches a sextant from it's display stand, then puts it back) 
PICARD: Well. Here we are, eh, Jono? 
PICARD: I notice you haven't taken off your gloves. 
JONO: Not here. 
PICARD: Why not? 
JONO: So that I don't have to touch an alien. 
PICARD: Jono, your Captain, Endar, has he ever hurt you? Inflicted
pain? 
JONO: Pain is not a consideration. 
PICARD: Then he has? 
JONO: I did not say that. Don't you understand? Pain is not what
matters. Passing the tests is everything. 
PICARD: Is that what they are? Tests of pain? 
JONO: You understand nothing. 
PICARD: It's true, I don't fully understand Talarians. But you are not
Talarian. 
JONO: I will not listen to this. I will not listen to your lies.
