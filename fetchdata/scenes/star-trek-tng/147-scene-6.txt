[Bridge]

PICARD:
Begin long-range scanning
of all sectors within three
light years of Braslota. How
is your crew shaping up? 
RIKER:
It's complete, but I would like to request an addition. 
PICARD: Anyone in particular? 
RIKER: With your permission, I would like Acting Ensign Crusher aboard
for educational observation. 
(Picard nods) 
WESLEY: Thank you, Captain. 
(Wesley leaves) 
RIKER: It appears we will have some time before reaching Braslota. I
was wondering if you'd agree to play me in a game of Strategema. 
KOLRAMI: Although I am intrigued by the audacity of your request, I
can't fathom why you wish the encounter. 
RIKER: I enjoy a challenge. 
KOLRAMI: Very well. An opponent of limited dimensions can often be
quite diverting. 
RIKER: Thank you.


[Corridor]


LAFORGE:
So you're going
to beat him? 
RIKER:
Nope. 
LAFORGE: Well, then it's going to be a close one. 
RIKER: No. 
LAFORGE: But you have got a chance? 
RIKER: Nah. 
LAFORGE: Are you going to bother to show up? 
RIKER: Sure, Kolrami is the best ever at Strategema. Just to get to
play him is a privilege. 
LAFORGE: Other aside from your being privileged, is there anything else
I can look forward to? 
RIKER: Nope. 
LAFORGE: This is going to be exciting.
