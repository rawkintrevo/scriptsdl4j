[Market place]

RIKER: Doctor Crusher! 
WESLEY: Mother, it's Commander Riker. 
RIKER: Hello, Wes. Enjoying Farpoint Station? 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: I saw you. I thought I might join you for a stroll. 
CRUSHER: Actually, we were about to do some shopping. 
RIKER: I've been meaning to visit the mall myself. 
CRUSHER: Of course. 
WESLEY: If you're wondering about Mom, Commander Riker, she's not
unfriendly. She's just shy around men she doesn't know. 
CRUSHER: Wesley! I believe that means he would like us to be friends. 
RIKER: I'm willing, Doctor. Although we're not officially part of the
Enterprise, I thought there might be something useful we can do while
we wait. 
CRUSHER: Useful? How, Commander? 
RIKER: Investigating some things that I've noticed since I've been
here. The last was a piece of fruit. 
CRUSHER: (examining a bolt of cloth) Gold would be lovely with this. I
am sure, Commander, there are reasons for a first officer to want to
demonstrate his energy and alertness to a new captain. But since my
duty and interests are outside the command
structure 
(Suddenly the bolt of cloth has a gold pattern on it) 
RIKER: Isn't it remarkable they happen to have exactly what you asked
for? 
CRUSHER: Thank you. I'll take the entire bolt. Send it to our starship
when it arrives. Charge to Doctor Crusher. 
(they walk away from the stall) 
RIKER: Let's see, where were we? 
CRUSHER: I was accusing you of inventing work in order to curry favour
with our new captain. I apologise. 
WESLEY: Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there. 
CRUSHER: Maybe this is something Jean-Luc would like looked into. 
RIKER: Jean-Luc Picard? You know the Captain? 
WESLEY: When I was little, he brought my father's body home to us. 
CRUSHER: Yes, Wes, long, long ago. A pleasure to meet you, Commander.
You will excuse us. 
RIKER: My pleasure, Doctor. Wes. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
RIKER: See you on board. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
(Crusher and Wesley leave Riker, and another uniformed man arrives,
wearing a device across his eyes) 
LAFORGE: Sir, the Enterprise is arriving 
RIKER: Is this an official report, Lieutenant? 

LAFORGE: Sorry, Commander. Sir, Lieutenant La Forge reporting. The
Enterprise arriving, but without the saucer section, sir. 
RIKER: Stardrive section only? What happened? 
LAFORGE: I don't know, sir. Captain Picard has signalled for you to
beam up immediately. 
RIKER: Our new captain doesn't waste time. It's a good idea. Thank you,
Lieutenant. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: (moves into a clear space) Enterprise, this is Commander Riker
at Farpoint Station. Standing by
to beam up.
