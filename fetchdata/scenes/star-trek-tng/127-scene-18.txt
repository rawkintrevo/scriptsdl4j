TROI WORF PICARD RIKER PULASKI WESLEY DEALT NURSE DATA

[Bridge]

(Troi enters, very out of uniform and with a
noticeable bump) 
PICARD: How are you feeling? 
TROI: I should be feeling uncomfortable with all the changes in my body
but, I don't. I feel fine. Better than fine. Wonderful. 
RIKER: Standard orbit. 
WESLEY: Standard orbit, sir. 
PICARD: Open hailing frequencies. 
WORF: Hailing frequencies open. 
PICARD: 'Audet Nine, this is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
Enterprise. 
DEALT [on viewscreen]: Ah, the Enterprise, here at last. Well, good.
Let's get going. 
PICARD: Excuse me, to whom am I speaking? 
DEALT [on viewscreen]: To whom are you speaking? Oh I'm Lieutenant
Commander Hester Dealt, Medical Trustee, Federation Medical Collection
Station. 
PICARD: Are the specimens ready for transfer? 
DEALT [on viewscreen]: Yes, but with your permission I would like to
inspect the containment area before we proceed. Now it's not that I
doubt the ability of your crew, but we cannot afford a mistake. 
PICARD: I appreciate your caution. In the like vein, I want a complete,
detailed manifest of everything you intend to bring on board my ship. 
DEALT [on viewscreen]: Very good. I will allow access you to my
computer banks, okay? 
(transmission ends) 
PICARD: Mister Data, download the inventory and cross-reference it with
the medical computer. Number One, arrange to have Hester Dealt
transported up. 
Captain's log, supplemental. Although it's been
fourteen hours since we arrived at
'audet Nine. Hester Dealt has still not completed inspection of the
containment unit. A transfer will not be permitted until he's assured
of zero growth during our voyage. Meanwhile, the desperate pleas from
the Rachelis System continue.

DATA: Captain, the final manifest has been
received. 
PICARD: At last. Review it with Doctor Pulaski. I want you both to be
completely familiar with it. 
DATA: Aye, sir.

[Corridor]

TROI: Data, will you help me get to Sickbay.

[Pulaski's office]

TROI: It's time. 
PULASKI: Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you to Maternity. 
DATA: Worf, assemble your security team in Sickbay. 
PULASKI: Is that necessary? 
DATA: Yes, Doctor. Captain's orders. 
PULASKI: Well, it's strange to need armed guards in a delivery room.
This way. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: How frequent are your contractions? 
TROI: Very close together. 
PULASKI: In my other deliveries, except for a couple, the father was
always present. 
TROI: Difficult under the circumstances. 
DATA: Perhaps I could serve in that capacity. 
PULASKI: Counsellor Troi is going to need the comfort of a human touch,
not the cold hand of technology. 
TROI: Doctor, I think Commander Data will do very nicely. 
PULASKI: Your choice. 
(A little later, Deanna is in the birthing chair, almost upright) 
TROI: You don't have to do anything, Data. Just be with me. 
PULASKI: There is nothing to be nervous about. 
DATA: Nervous? I find this very interesting. Although I understand, in
technical terms, how life is formed, there is still a part of the
process which eludes me. The child inside you, are you able to access
his thought process? Does he have thoughts? You are aware of him. Is he
aware of you? And when does that awareness begin? 
TROI: It's happening. 
DATA: How does it feel? 
TROI: Data! 
DATA: Yes? 
TROI: Now!
DATA: Now? Now! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! 
PULASKI: This is an impatient baby. He's eager to make his appearance.
Do you want something for the pain? It will in no way diminish the
experience. 
TROI: I have felt no pain. 
PULASKI: None? 
TROI: No, none at all. 
(Worf and two guards enter) 
PULASKI: Have your Security men stand back. I understand the importance
of having you here, but keep out from underfoot. Foetal position? 
NURSE: Normal. 
PULASKI: Foetal pulse? 
NURSE: One thirty seven. 
PULASKI: The baby is showing healthy respiratory movements. 
(Riker sneaks in to watch) 
PULASKI: (kneeling in front of Troi) The action of the heart rate is
good. The baby's doing wonderfully, Troi. Breathe slowly. You're doing
great. Stay calm. That's it. There it is. I've got him. You can relax. 
(Baby crying) 
PULASKI: (cleaning him off) There, there. That's a good boy. It's okay.
Oh, my, he's beautiful. (hands him to Troi) Are easy births the norm
for Betazoids? 
TROI: Not according to my mother. 
PULASKI: (to Worf) You can come in the rest of the way now. There's no
threat, Lieutenant. You and your men can relax. It's just a baby. 
(Worf looks and leaves) 
DATA: Thank you for allowing me to participate. It was remarkable. 
PULASKI: Do you have a name? 
TROI: Ian Andrew, after my father. 
(Riker comes forward) 
TROI: Were you hear all along? 
RIKER: Yes. He's beautiful, Deanna. Just like his mother. 
PULASKI: How do you feel? 
TROI: Fine. Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor, for everything. 
PULASKI: Amazing.

[Bridge]

PULASKI: Captain. 
PICARD: Doctor. Welcome to the Bridge. Please, sit down. How is
Counsellor Troi? Did she have a good night? 
PULASKI: I've delivered dozens of babies, but none like this. There was
no pain, no trauma. 
RIKER: It's true. 
PULASKI: It was effortless for both of them. 
PICARD: I'm not sure of your point. 
PULASKI: She had her baby yesterday. If I were to examine her now, I
would not be able to tell she had a baby, or had ever had a baby. It
was as if the incident never happened. 
PICARD: Data, how long before we begin the transfer? 
DATA: Two hours nineteen minutes, sir. 
PICARD: Number One, you have the Bridge. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: You will accompany me, Doctor? Please? I think it's time I paid
my respects.
