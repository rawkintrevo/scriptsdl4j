[Council Chambers]

PICARD: Would you care to comment privately how you
read any of this? 
TROI: Unnecessary, sir. These people are honest, almost to a fault. And
they have great pride in their ways. 
GUEST4: You're the Captain. We're ready. This way, please. 
(Benches have been arranged in a circle. Picard has a chair to himself)

GUEST4: Welcome to our world, Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
GUEST4: We regret that our system of justice is troubling you. 
PICARD: The boy, Wesley Crusher, where is he, please? 
RIKER: In accord with the Prime Directive, I've allowed them to hold
him pending the outcome of this. 
GUEST5: He is safe and unharmed. We promise that. Captain Picard, I do
not know how you Earth people conduct law and justice, even if you
respect such things. 
PICARD: We do. 
GUEST4: Good, so do we. Our precepts have been handed down from long
ago. The tranquillity you see in our lives has been made possible by
our laws. 
GUEST5: We are a people of law. They do sometimes bring us sadness, but
we have learned to adjust to that. Perhaps your laws work as well. 
PICARD: They haven't always, but now they do. 
GUEST4: Do you execute criminals? 
PICARD: No, not any longer. 
GUEST5: But you did once? 
PICARD: Unfortunately, yes. But since then 
GUEST5: But when you did, was it believed necessary to do so? 
PICARD: Some people felt that it was necessary. But we have learned to
detect the seeds of criminal behaviour Capital punishment, in our
world, is no longer considered a justifiable deterrent. 
GUEST4: So, we are not yet as advanced as they are. And since you are
advanced in other ways too, I suggest you use your superior powers to
rescue the Wesley boy. We will record him as a convicted criminal out
of our reach, an advanced person who luckily escaped the barbarism of
this backward little world. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, we have a law known as the Prime Directive. 
GUEST5: Riker has explained it to us. 
PICARD: Is the boy in any danger from you at this moment? 
GUEST4: Until sundown? 
GUEST5: Because you are strangers, we are delaying enforcement of the
law. But we must act by sundown. 
PICARD: Then I have another question. While orbiting, while circling
high above your world, as we do, we have encountered a strange object.
A vessel perhaps. Have you any idea what it is? It's not entirely real.
At least, it's not completely solid. 
GUEST5: Do you mean God? 
PICARD: God? 
GUEST4: God is said to be somewhere up there, protecting us. 
PICARD: Exactly, exactly how would you describe God? 
GUEST5: As you just did. As existing both here and in another place
also. 
GUEST4: But when God wants to show its power, it can make itself felt
most fully. 
CRUSHER [OC]: Captain, come in please. 
PICARD: Picard here. 
GUEST1 [OC]: CMO Crusher, sir.
