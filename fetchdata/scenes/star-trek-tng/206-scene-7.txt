DATA: Have you found the Academy challenging,
Wesley? 
WESLEY: Yeah. I thought after being on the Enterprise, it would be a
breeze, but there's a lot more to learn than just starship operations.
What was your first year like? 
DATA: Although I did extremely well scholastically, my lack of human
understanding often created social obstacles. 
WESLEY: Like what? 
DATA: I particularly remember the phenomenon of practical jokes,
several of which I fell victim to. 
WESLEY: Tell me about it. My first week that I was there, this guy
named Adam Martoni reprogrammed the sonic shower to cover me with mud.
It took me a while, but I got him back really good. 
DATA: Good for you. 
WESLEY: Thanks. 
DATA: I also found social gatherings difficult. There was one event, an
Academy tradition, the Sadie Hawkins Dance? 
WESLEY: They still hold it, every year. 
DATA: A notably awkward experience. 
WESLEY: I know what you mean. I can't even dance. 
DATA: Really? Your mother is quite an expert. She recently taught me. 
WESLEY: The Dancing Doctor? She tried to teach me too, but I just don't
have the knack. 
DATA: I would be happy to teach you dancing. I have programmed a
comprehensive seventeen part
course with some interesting holographic partners. 
WESLEY: I'll let you know.

WESLEY: I'll modify the planetary scanners. 
LAFORGE: Just make sure we keep enough data lines open for stellar
physics. 
WESLEY: No problem. I'll compress the signal flow. 
LAFORGE: All right. 
(Geordi leaves him to it) 
WESLEY: Why aren't these registering? 
ROBIN: You might try calibrating them manually. 
WESLEY: Excuse me? 
ROBIN: The detectors. They tend to get temperamental. You can try
calibrating them by hand. 
WESLEY: You're kidding. The computer has to do this. 
ROBIN: No. Look. The subroutine lets you do it from the panel. Law
Seventeen. When all else fails, do it yourself. 
WESLEY: It's working. Thanks. 
ROBIN: Sure. 
WESLEY: By the way, I'm Wesley. Wesley Crusher. 
ROBIN: I know. Just came back from the Academy. 
WESLEY: That's right. 
ROBIN: Robin Lefler. 
WESLEY: Hi. 
ROBIN: Hi. 
ROBIN: Your neutrinos are drifting. 
(he finally lets go of her hand) 
WESLEY: They're what?
