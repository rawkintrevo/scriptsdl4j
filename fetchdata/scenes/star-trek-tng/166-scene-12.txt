[Data's quarters]

(The senior officer's floating poker game is in
session) 
RIKER: Five, and twenty. 
LAFORGE: Ouch. 
TROI: If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking, I'm thinking. 
(The doorbell rings) 
DATA: Enter. 
PICARD 2: Counsellor, gentlemen. Forgive this intrusion. I was just
passing by. 
DATA: You are always welcome, Captain. 
PICARD 2: I was wondering, Mister La Forge. What's our engine
efficiency status? 
LAFORGE: Operating at ninety three percent, sir. 
PICARD 2: That's very good, but I would like to increase the efficiency
to ninety five percent. 
LAFORGE: No problem, Captain, I'll get right on it. 
PICARD 2: That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want to
disrupt your recreation. 
LAFORGE: No Captain, it's no problem. Lady Luck left me long ago. 
(La Forge leaves) 
TROI: Would you care to join us, Captain? We have an opening. 
PICARD 2: I'd rather just observe, if you don't mind. 
RIKER: Not at all. Counsellor, twenty. 
(She and Data see Riker's bid) 
RIKER: Pair of threes. 
TROI: Flush. Queen high. 
DATA: That beats my fours. 
PICARD 2: Well played, Counsellor. May I have a word with you for just
a moment? 
TROI: Certainly, sir. 
PICARD 2: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in a
moment.

[Corridor]

PICARD 2: Counsellor, I wanted to ask you about the
crew. How are they reacting to our sudden change in course? 
TROI: I sense no unusual reaction, Captain. After all, such a change is
hardly out of the ordinary. 
PICARD 2: They're not curious or concerned as to why? 
TROI: They're curious, yes. But concerned? No, they trust you. 
PICARD 2: How far do you think that trust goes? 
TROI: Sir? 
PICARD 2: I know, Counsellor, that the crew has always had full
confidence in me. But what if it were to change? 
TROI: Well, I'd inform you, sir, of course. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Counsellor.

[Holding cell]

ESOQQ: My given name is Esoqq. It means fighter. 
THOLL: I'll bet half the names in the Chalnoth language mean fighter. 
ESOQQ: Mizarians. Your names all mean surrender. 
THOLL: We are a peaceful race, a race of thinkers. 
ESOQQ: A race of cowards. And you? I don't know your people. 
HARO: I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine. 
ESOQQ: Who would want to imprison a child? 
HARO: I'm not a child. 
PICARD: Esoqq, I've been trying to determine if we have a common enemy.
Someone with a reason for confining us here. 
ESOQQ: There are Chalnoth who would kill me if they could. But kidnap?
There is no reason. 
PICARD: You have many enemies? 
ESOQQ: None of consequence. I've slain all the ones who mattered. That
shocks you, Bolian? 
HARO: A little. 
ESOQQ: And you? 
THOLL: I'm not surprised. I've heard about your race. You're
uncivilised. You have no laws, no system of government 
ESOQQ: The Chalnoth have no use for laws or governments! We are strong.
We obey no one. 
THOLL: You live in anarchy, murdering one another, That mentality may
get us all killed. 
ESOQQ: And you may be the first. 
PICARD: Both of you. This is getting us nowhere. 
THOLL: Neither is asking us useless questions, Picard. But, if you must
pursue the topic, How long have you and the Romulans been adversaries? 
PICARD: For quite a while, Mister Tholl. I am perfectly willing to
entertain the hypothesis that our captors are Romulans.
But what would the Romulans want with you? 
THOLL: My brainpower, perhaps. It's well known that my species
possesses superior intelligence and I am considered among the brightest
of my people. 
HARO: And the least modest. 
ESOQQ: What is this? 
PICARD: Food. 
ESOQQ: The only food? 
PICARD: It would seem so. 
ESOQQ: Poison! 
THOLL: Does this mean there's nothing here for you to eat? 
ESOQQ: You. 
THOLL: Don't even think that! Picard, you won't let him 
PICARD: Esoqq, how long can you go without food? 
ESOQQ: Three days. Perhaps four. 
PICARD: No longer? 
ESOQQ: No longer.

[Doctor's office]

CRUSHER: Well, all your tests indicate the same
results. You are in great shape. 
PICARD 2: I never felt better. 
CRUSHER: I see. Then why did you come in? Your annual physical isn't
due for another month. 
PICARD 2: Well, usually you have to remind me, then badger me, and
finally order me to report. For once I thought I'd save you the
trouble. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, be honest with your doctor. Are there any warning
signs or symptoms that you haven't told me about? 
PICARD 2: As far as I know, I'm perfectly healthy. 
CRUSHER: Well, then, return to your post. 
PICARD 2: Will you have dinner with me tonight? 
CRUSHER: In Ten Forward? 
PICARD 2: What about my quarters? More intimate. 
CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, you are full of surprises today. 
PICARD 2: I take that to be a yes.

[Holding cell]

THOLL: Picard is it wise to attempt an escape? 
PICARD: It's imperative. 
THOLL: Why? Our captors haven't mistreated us. 
HARO: We've been kidnapped, locked in a room. You don't think that's
mistreatment? 
THOLL: They haven't hurt us, have they? I think we should just wait
until we find out what they want. Be patient. 
PICARD: We can no longer afford to be patient. Unless we act soon,
Esoqq will starve. 
THOLL: If we antagonise them, they may decide we're more trouble than
we're worth, kill us and go capture another four. 
PICARD: I agree that's a risk, but I see no alternative. 
THOLL: Well, I refuse to help. 
PICARD: As you wish, Mister Tholl. We must get inside this panel. 
ESOQQ: Not very sturdy. 
PICARD: Stand back, Haro. 
(Esoqq puts his fist through the panel and rips the surround out of the
wall) 
HARO: The design is simple. Cross-circuiting the door mechanism should
be easy. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
HARO: Yes, sir. 
(She flips a few connections then reaches up inside the wall) 
HARO: I think I've got it. 
(The door opens an inch, closes again, then a green light hits the
three. They fall to the floor in pain) 
THOLL: I warned you.
