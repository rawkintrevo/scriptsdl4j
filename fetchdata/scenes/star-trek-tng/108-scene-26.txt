[Bridge]

PICARD: Well done. Warp engines ready on previous
heading. Warp factor six.

[Antican quarters]

ANTICAN: I tolerate these questions, Lieutenant
Yar, because I need this vessel to get us to Parliament. Your shipboard
problems do not concern me. 
TASHA: They should. Our delays are your delays. 
ANTICAN: The peace conference will wait for us. 
TASHA: I must ask where you were during this vessel's Earth hours of
eighteen hundred last night and zero seven hundred this morning. 
ANTICAN: Eating. 
TASHA: Sir, we're talking about hours here. 
ANTICAN: It was a large meal, Lieutenant Yar. And a very interesting
animal.

[Crusher's office]

WORF: You wanted me, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: Yes, concerning your memory blackout. 
WORF: I still don't remember having one. 
CRUSHER: The same thing happened to me. 
TROI: I want to try hypnosis on both of you. It may restore your memory
as to what happened. 
[Observation lounge]

TASHA: One thing is clear. Almost all of the peace
delegates answered our questions with lies. 
DATA: (smoking a meerschaum pipe) Imprecise, Lieutenant. They omitted
certain truths, which in itself tells us something. 
TASHA: We can learn something from non-disclosure? 
DATA: Indubitably, my good woman. 
RIKER: It's something the Captain mentioned. Sherlock Holmes.
Indubitably, Data has been studying him. 
DATA: Has studied, sir. Every case. As Holmes would've pointed out,
during the time in question, something was afoot. 
TASHA: Afoot? 
DATA: While both sets of delegates say they were in their quarters, our
crew locator sensed them passing here and here. 
TASHA: But since it doesn't show where they went, we're still in the
dark. 
DATA: On the contrary, dear colleague. On their return, they drew
medical supplies appropriate to the treatment of minor wounds and
abrasions on these life forms. 
RIKER: Which, leaves us with only one conclusion. 
DATA: Exactly. That they were too engaged in their own affairs to have
disabled our ship and murdered the Engineer. Given a choice, they'd
rather kill each other than any of us. It's elementary, my dear Riker.
Sir.
