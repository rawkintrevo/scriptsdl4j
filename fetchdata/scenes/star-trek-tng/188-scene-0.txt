GUINAN MADELINE

[Hill's outer office]

GUINAN: Dixon Hill around? 
MADELINE: He's occupied at the present moment. 
GUINAN: Tell him Gloria's here. 
MADELINE: Can't do that. He doesn't want to be disturbed. 
GUINAN: Tell him it's Gloria from Cleveland. 
MADELINE: Doesn't matter if you're from the moon, hon. Mister Hill is
incommuni, incommunica, ka 
GUINAN: Incommunicado. 
MADELINE: That's it. Sorry, hon. 
GUINAN: Look, hon. Just tell him Gloria's here. 
MADELINE: Look, when the boss doesn't want to be disturbed, the boss
doesn't want to be disturbed. Don't take it personal, like. 
GUINAN: I have an appointment with Mister Hill at two o'clock. 
MADELINE: It's two ten. 
GUINAN: So I had a little trouble getting into the dress. It took me a
little while to figure out exactly what I was supposed to do with
these. (stockings and suspender belt) 
MADELINE: Sorry, Dix. There's a lady here to see you, says her name is 
GUINAN: Gloria 
MADELINE: Gloria. 
GUINAN: From Cleveland. 
MADELINE: From Cleveland. Okay. He never heard of you. 
GUINAN: He's never heard of me? 
MADELINE: That's right. 
GUINAN: Oh, wait, I think you don't understand. You see, this was all
been set up in advance. You see, I'm supposed to be Gloria from
Cleveland, and I was supposed to be on holodeck number four at two
o'clock and you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, do you. Not
to worry. 
MADELINE: Hey, you can't go in there!
