[Corridor]

RIKER: I remember studying his career in school.
The treaty of Alpha Cygnus Nine, the Coridan admission to the
Federation, the Klingon Alliance. 
PICARD: I met him once, many years ago, very briefly at his son's
wedding. I can tell you that was quite a moment for a young lieutenant,
standing in the presence of such history. I remember he spoke to me and
I just stood there grinning like an idiot. 
RIKER: You? Tongue-tied? 
PICARD: Indeed. How do you make small talk with someone who shaped the
Federation? 
RIKER: Is it true that he'll be retiring after this mission? 
PICARD: Unofficially, that's what I hear. What a crowning achievement
for his career. The benefits of relations with the Legarans are
incalculable.

stockier human) 
MENDROSSEN: Ah Captain Picard. I am Ki Mendrossen, the ambassador's
chief of staff. This is Sakkath, his personal assistant. 
PICARD: Has the ambassador been delayed? 
MENDROSSEN: He will be joining us momentarily. But first we must
discuss some matters of the utmost delicacy. 
PICARD: Please go ahead. 
MENDROSSEN: To be frank, Captain, the ambassador is not a young man. He
tires easily. 
SAKKATH: He's going to need a lot of rest to prepare himself for the
difficult job that awaits him. 
MENDROSSEN: Which is why it is imperative that he be allowed to
conserve his strength. I must request that you dispense with any formal
activities normally associated with a visitor of his rank. 
RIKER: We had planned a ship's concert this evening. 
PICARD: I believe the Ambassador is extremely fond of Mozart. 
MENDROSSEN: I'm afraid it would be impossible for him to attend. Upon
his arrival he will be taken directly to his quarters where he will
remain in seclusion until we reach Legara Four. 
PICARD: You have my assurance that the Ambassador will not be disturbed
during the voyage. 
MENDROSSEN: That's all we ask. Well, now that's settled, the Ambassador
is waiting. 
(Sarek and Perrin are beamed aboard) 
PICARD: Welcome aboard the Enterprise, Ambassador Sarek. 
SAREK: We come to serve. 
PICARD: Your service honours us. 
SAREK: Allow me to present she who is my wife. 
PICARD: Mrs. Sarek. 
PERRIN: Please call me Perrin, Captain. 
PICARD: This is my first officer, Commander William Riker. 
PERRIN: Captain, would you be so kind as to show us to our quarters? 
SAREK: I prefer to view the conference room first. 
MENDROSSEN: Ambassador, I'm sure Sakkath and I can handle all the
necessary details. 
SAREK: I will examine it for myself. 
PERRIN: Perhaps it would be best if we settled in first. 
SAREK: They worry about my health, Captain. Too much. You will take me
to the conference room, please. 
RIKER: If you'll follow me, sir.
