DATA: Although Alpha Onias three is a class M
planet, our survey teams have listed it as barren and inhospitable. 
RIKER: Any life signs? 
DATA: No, sir, but we have traced residual energy readings to a cavern
two kilometres beneath the surface. 
WORF: Romulans? 
DATA: It is possible. 
PICARD: I suppose you'll just have to go down there and find out. 
RIKER: Geordi, Worf, you're with me. 
PICARD: Number One. Happy birthday.

(They beam into a place of extraordinary
stalagmites and a wonderfully flat floor) 
LAFORGE: I'm detecting high levels of volcanic gases. Sulphur dioxide,
methane, hydrogen sulphide. 
RIKER: Toxic? 
LAFORGE: We're okay for now, but I wouldn't want to spend my vacation
here. 
RIKER: What about energy readings? 
WORF: Magnetic clutter is increasing. I cannot make an accurate
determination. 
LAFORGE: Same here, Commander. I'm getting a lot of confusing readings
here, 
PICARD [OC]: Commander Riker, please acknowledge. 
RIKER: Riker here.
