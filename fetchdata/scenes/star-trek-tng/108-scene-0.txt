[Transporter room]

PICARD: Is that all right?

SELAY: And we must be upwind from the Anticans. 
RIKER: Of course, sir. 
(Riker and the delegation leave) 
TASHA: Neither seem like very promising Federation candidates, sir. 
PICARD: Even Parliament's peacemakers may find this case a little
difficult.
