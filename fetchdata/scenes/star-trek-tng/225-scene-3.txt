[Living room]

(suddenly Riker's face is replaced by a woman's) 
ELINE: Well. finally. How are you feeling? Kamin, can you answer me? 
PICARD: What is this place? 
ELINE: You're still feverish. 
PICARD: Computer, freeze programme. Computer, end programme. 
ELINE: Kamin. 
PICARD: Picard to Enterprise. 
ELINE: Kamin, please don't get up yet. You're still not well. 
PICARD: I asked you, what is this place? 
ELINE: This is your home, of course. 
PICARD: Am I a prisoner here? 
ELINE: Please, dear, you've had a high fever for three days. You
mustn't push yourself too quickly. Kamin? You really shouldn't go
outside.

[Courtyard]

(bright sunshine and a feeling of a hot, slightly
arid environment) 
ELINE: Kamin, please come back inside. 
(But Picard marches off to explore)

[Town square]

(from the cool shade of a colonnade, Picard watches
a tree-planting ceremony) 
BATAI: Thank you. This sapling is planted as an affirmation of life in
defiance of the drought and with expectations of long life.
Whatever comes, we will keep it alive as a symbol of our survival.
Kamin! You're back on your feet! How do you feel, my friend? 
PICARD: Are you in charge here? 
BATAI: In charge? 
PICARD: I want to be returned to my ship immediately. 
BATAI: What ship is that? 
PICARD: Please, just tell me, what is this place? Where am I? 
BATAI: The fever. It's taken your memory. 
PICARD: That must be it. Perhaps you can help me. 
BATAI: Anything, my friend. 
PICARD: My name is Kamin? 
BATAI: Yes. 
PICARD: And you are? 
BATAI: Batai. Council leader Batai. 
PICARD: Ah. Batai. And you say I've been ill? 
BATAI: For more than a week. Eline should've put you in the hospital,
but she insisted on caring for you herself. 
PICARD: Eline? 
BATAI: Your wife. If you don't remember that, maybe it's safer not to
go home. 
PICARD: And what is this place? 
BATAI: Perhaps you should see the doctor. 
PICARD: No, please, I'm sure it will all come back to me. 
BATAI: This is the community of Ressik. Northern province. 
PICARD: What planet? 
BATAI: Let me take you back home. 
PICARD: No, really, I'm quite all right. Just answer me. What planet? 
BATAI: This is the planet Kataan. 
PICARD: Kataan. Not a Federation planet. I think I'll just take a walk.

BATAI: But you've been ill for a week. 
PICARD: The exercise will do me good. I'll try to re-acquaint myself
with the surroundings. 
(he goes up into the hills and looks down on the white-walled community
perched on an outcrop above a very small river)
