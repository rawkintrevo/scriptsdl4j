[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I can't find anything wrong with your
internal time base. As far as I can tell, your primary systems check
out fine. 
DATA: I will compare my autonomic logs with the ship's chronometer.
Perhaps we have overlooked something. 
LAFORGE: You know, Data, there's an awful lot we don't know about your
dream programme. Maybe it was designed to cause side effects. I mean,
for all we know, Doctor Soong might have intended for you to oversleep
from time to time. It's part of the human experience. 
DATA: It is a possibility. However, I would prefer to make certain
there are no anomalies in my neural net. 
LAFORGE: You know, I'm curious. What were you dreaming about when we
woke you up? 
DATA: I have not fully assimilated its impact. I would prefer to study
the images further before discussing them. 
LAFORGE: Sounds like it must have been pretty strange. 
DATA: Strange is not a sufficient adjective to describe the experience.

[Holodeck - Freud's consulting room]

GUEST2: Tell me more about this cake. 
DATA: It is difficult to explain. Counsellor Troi's body was a cake. 
GUEST2: Her upper body. Describe the knife you used to cut the
Counsellor. 
DATA: It had a black handle and a serrated blade, and it was quite
long. 
GUEST2: How long? 
DATA: Twenty five centimetres in length. 
GUEST2: And what happened next? 
DATA: One of the workmen pointed to her right shoulder. At that moment,
I had an overwhelming urge to cut a piece out of the cake. 
GUEST2: And did you? 
DATA: Yes. As I began slicing the cake, she reacted as though I was
causing her pain. Yet I could not stop cutting. That is when I woke up.
Doctor Freud, I am curious. 
(Data starts to sit up from the couch and is gestured to lie down
again) 
DATA: I am curious. What do my nightmares mean? 
GUEST2: I believe you are experiencing a classic dismemberment dream. Or
in your case, being a mechanical man, a dismantlement dream. 
DATA: I do not understand. 
GUEST2: Your mechanistic qualities are trying to reassert themselves
over your human tendencies. Ego and id struggling for domination. The
workmen symbolise the ever present id constantly working to destroy the
ego. Now the image of Counsellor Troi, a female, is devoured by you,
clearly indicating an unconscious desire to possess your own mother. 
DATA: But I do not have a mother. 
GUEST2: Do not interrupt. The knife in its violent connotation suggests
a certain feeling of sexual inadequacy. 
DATA: but I have no sexual desire. 
GUEST2: Ach! Impotence on top of everything. It is all becoming clear to
me now. There might be a paper in this. 
DATA: I do not believe I am being helped by this session. 
GUEST2: Classic transference. Your anger toward me is, in fact, the
animosity you feel toward your father. You are a polymorphously
perverse individual, Mister Data, and I recommend full psychoanalysis.
I believe I can fit you in next Tuesday. 
DATA: That will not be necessary. Computer, end programme.
