PICARD: Is it a life form, Data? 
DATA [OC]: Again, insufficient information, sir. 
PICARD: Theorise.

[Planet surface]

DATA: It is possible. 
(The oil slick ripples, and speaks) 
ARMUS: Very good, tin man. 

[Bridge]

PICARD: What is it, Number One? What are you
seeing? 
[Planet surface]

(As a vaguely humanoid shape rises wet and
glistening from the slick) 
RIKER: Trouble.

Captain's log, supplemental. While on a mission to
rescue survivors from an unexplained shuttle crash, the away team has
encountered a strange creature which seems able to assume different
forms, including one which resembles humanoid.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Easy, Number One. Let's find out what it is
we're dealing with. 
RIKER [OC]: Agreed, Captain. 
PICARD: Number One, I don't believe that the location of the crash and
the proximity of the creature is a coincidence. 

[Planet surface]

RIKER: I am Commander William Riker of the USS
Enterprise. 
ARMUS: I am Armus. Why are you here? 
RIKER: We mean you no harm. We have injured crewmen in the
shuttlecraft. We need to get to them. May we pass? 
ARMUS: You haven't given me a good enough reason. 
RIKER: Preserving life, all life, is very important to us. 
ARMUS: Why? 
RIKER: We believe everything in the universe has a right to exist. 
ARMUS: An interesting notion which I do not share. You may now leave,
if you wish. 
TASHA: We're not going without our shuttle crew. 
ARMUS: I warn you. 
TASHA: Enough! We have people who need attention. We won't hurt you,
but we must help them. 
(Armus lets lose a bolt of energy which sends Tasha flying a long way.
Riker and Data's phasers have no effect on Armus)
PICARD [OC]: Number One! 
RIKER: The creature attacked us. Lieutenant Yar is down. 
DATA: It seems to feed on our phaser energy. 
RIKER: We had no effect on it. 
(Armus sinks back into the slick) 
PICARD: What's Lieutenant Yar's condition? Doctor Crusher, report! 
CRUSHER: She's dead.
