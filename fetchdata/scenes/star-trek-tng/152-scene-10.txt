emergency technique beings healed born accomplished does damage disappear

[Hillside]

RIKER: Doctor, be careful. 
CRUSHER: I've got to get down there. 
(Oji hides and watches as Crusher runs down to Liko, scans him then
makes her decision) 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Enterprise. Medical emergency. Two to beam directly
to Sickbay. 
OGAWA [OC]: Aye, Doctor. 
(Oji sees the strange woman and her father vanish) 
[Duck blind]

LAFORGE: That should do it. 
(It does. Oji sees the window disappear and be replaced by the cliff
face. Curious, she investigates) 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: (to nurse) You increased the levels of
tricordrazine? (re Barron) Let me see his chart, please. 
(dialogue too faint to make out, and Picard enters) 
PICARD: Doctor Crusher. 
CRUSHER: Before you start quoting me the Prime Directive, he'd already
seen us. The damage was done. It was either bring him aboard or let him
die. 
PICARD: Then why didn't you let him die? 
CRUSHER: Because we were responsible for his injuries. 
PICARD: I'm not sure that I concur with that reasoning, Doctor. But now
that he's here, you must remove all memory of his encounter with the
away team. 
CRUSHER: By erasing short term recall? 
PICARD: It has been accomplished before. 
CRUSHER: I am familiar with Doctor Pulaski's technique. I can't
guarantee it will be effective on Mintakan brain chemistry. Their
lie-zone levels are much lower. 
BARRON: Wait. No! No! We must evacuate. 
CRUSHER: Doctor Barron, you're on the Enterprise. You're safe. 
BARRON: The others? 
PICARD: Doctor Warren is here. We're doing all we can. 
(Liko wakes up and listens) 
BARRON: And Palmer? Where is Palmer? 
PICARD: Still on Mintaka Three. 
BARRON: Picard, you have to find him. 
PICARD: We will. 
BARRON: He may be hurt. 
PICARD: Rest assured we shall not leave until he is located. 
BARRON: Thank you, Picard. 
PICARD: Picard to bridge. Report. 
WORF [OC]: Scans of the planet detect no humans, Captain. 
PICARD: Very well. Put us into a close orbit. 
WORF [OC]: Sir, a close orbit will increase sensor efficiency by only
four percent. 
PICARD: I want that four percent, Lieutenant. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Picard out. 
LIKO: Picard? 
CRUSHER: Damn. 
PICARD: Well, Doctor. Your next task is clear.

[Hillside]

(Liko is beamed down alone. He wakes up) 
LIKO: Oji? Oji? 
(She hears him) 
OJI: Father? 
LIKO: Here. Oji. 
OJI: Father! I thought I'd never see you again. When you and the woman
vanished, I was sure you were dead. 
LIKO: I think I was, but I was brought back to life. Oji, I awoke in an
incredible place and my wounds were gone. I had been healed. 
OJI: How is that possible? 
LIKO: Long ago, our people believed in beings with great powers. These
beings made the rains come, told the sun when to rise, they caused all
life to be born, to grow, to die. 
OJI: But those are just tales, father. Old superstitions. 
LIKO: But perhaps the beliefs of our ancestors are true. Nothing else
can explain what's happened. Everything is changed now, Oji. We must
tell the others.

[Observation lounge]

CRUSHER: Barron is stable, but Warren is still
critical. 
RIKER: Palmer is missing. A scan of the planet shows Mintakan life
forms only, no humans. However 
DATA: The area around the duck blind exhibits Karst topography.
Sinkholes, underground rivers, and caverns. And the rock strata contain
a high concentration of thallium compounds which may be obstructing our
sensor beams. 
PICARD: So if Palmer, in his delirium, fled into a cave, we may be
unable to detect his life signs? 
DATA: Correct, sir. 
CRUSHER: Captain, if he is still alive, he needs medical attention. We
must send an away team to locate him. 
TROI: But our presence must not interfere with the cultural development
of the Mintakans. 
PICARD: Agreed. Further contamination must be prevented. 
RIKER: I have a suggestion.

First officer's log, Stardate 43174.2. Counsellor
Troi and I are beaming down to Mintaka Three to locate Doctor Palmer
and to determine the extent of the cultural contamination. Doctor
Crusher has temporarily altered our features and skin
colour. She's also implanted subcutaneous communicators so that any
transmissions we receive will be inaudible to the Mintakans.
