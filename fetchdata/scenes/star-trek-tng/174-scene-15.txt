[Borg ship]

(Picard is escorted to a balcony, where everyone
'talks' at him) 
BORG: Captain Jean Luc Picard, you lead the strongest ship of the
Federation fleet. You speak for your people. 
PICARD: I have nothing to say to you, and I will resist you with my
last ounce of strength. 
BORG: Strength is irrelevant. Resistance is futile. We wish to improve
ourselves. We will add your biological and technological
distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service ours. 
PICARD: Impossible. My culture is based on freedom and self
determination. 
BORG: Freedom is irrelevant. Self determination is irrelevant. You must
comply. 
PICARD: We would rather die. 
BORG: Death is irrelevant. Your archaic cultures are authority driven.
To facilitate our introduction into your societies, it has been decided
that a human voice will speak for us in all communications. You have
been chosen to be that voice.

[Bridge]

WORF: Commander, they are leading us into the heart
of our own defences. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, well, so far they haven't had any reason to worry about
our defences. 
WESLEY: Commander, if the Borg stay at warp nine point six, we'll be
forced to discontinue pursuit and power down in less than three hours. 
DATA: Two hours, forty minutes and three seconds. 
RIKER: How soon before the deflector's ready? 
LAFORGE: We're close. Few hours maybe. I know, I'll get it done in two
somehow, but Commander, I going to need serious power from the warp
engines to make this weapon work. So far we're using everything we've
got just to keep up with them. 
SHELBY: Sir, we've got to get that ship down to impulse. 
RIKER: I'm leading an away team over there to get the Captain back.
We'll find a way to bring them out of warp. Ensign Crusher, you
continue to assist Mister La Forge. Commander Shelby, you'll take the
Bridge and coordinate with Starfleet. Data, Worf, Doctor, you're with
me. 
SHELBY: Excuse me, sir. With my knowledge of the Borg 
RIKER: Those are my orders, Commander. 
TROI: Commander Riker. It is inappropriate for you to lead the away
team. Until the return of Captain Picard, you are in command of the
Enterprise. We're in a state of war, and your place is on the Bridge. 
RIKER: Commander Shelby, you'll lead the away team. Make it so.

First officer's log, stardate 43998.5. Our pursuit
of the Borg continues on a course that will take us to the very core of
the Federation. The devastation they could bring is beyond imagination.
