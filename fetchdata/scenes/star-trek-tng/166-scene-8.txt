HARO RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD TROI WESLEY ESOQQ THOLL DATA

[Holding cell]

(One of the other bed occupants is also in a
Starfleet engineering uniform. she is a green-tinged alien) 
PICARD: It's all right, it's al right. I'm not going to hurt you. 
HARO: Captain. 
PICARD: Picard, of the Enterprise. 
HARO: Captain Picard. We studied your missions at the Academy Mitena
Haro, first year cadet, Starfleet Academy. 
PICARD: Cadet Haro. 
THOLL: Perhaps you can explain what this is all about. 
(A tall, white-skinned alien wearing a hood) 
PICARD: Unfortunately, I can't, Mister 
THOLL: Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two. 
PICARD: Well, Mister Tholl, all I know is that I've been brought here
against my will. Wherever here is. 
HARO: The same thing happened to me, sir. I was alone, studying and I
fainted. When I came to, it was about three days ago. 
PICARD: And you, sir? 
THOLL: I've been here twelve days, possibly more. I had been meditating
privately and for no reason whatever, I lost
consciousness. 
PICARD: What can you tell me about our captors? 
THOLL: Nothing. They've never shown themselves. 
PICARD: Four sleeping areas. That implies we may be joined by another
captive. 
(He goes to the central thing, which dispenses red roundels) 
THOLL: It's edible, but I wouldn't call it food. 
(Picard takes a tentative bite and puts it down, then goes to the panel
by the door) 
THOLL: I wouldn't touch that. 
PICARD: Why not? 
THOLL: If it's the door lock, the combination's too complex to hit at
random. I tried it and was punished. 
PICARD: Punished? How? 
THOLL: Severe pain. Some sort of energy beam. I won't get near that
panel again. 
[Bridge]

WORF: Sir, the Hood has arrived at the rendezvous
point. They are expecting us in thirty six hours. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Lieutenant. Mister Data, the nearest pulsar is in
the Lonka cluster, is it not? 
DATA: Correct, sir. 
PICARD 2: What do we know about that pulsar? 
DATA: A great deal, sir. It is a rotating neutron star of approximately
four point three five six solar masses. 
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher, how long would it take us to get there? 
WESLEY: At warp seven, thirty four minutes. 
PICARD 2: Mister Crusher make it so. 
WESLEY: Sir? 
PICARD 2: Set course for the Lonka pulsar. Warp two. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. Sir, at warp two we'll arrive at the pulsar in thirty
one hours. 
PICARD 2: Thank you, Ensign. Engage. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Will we be delaying our rendezvous with the Hood, sir? 
PICARD 2: We may have to, Number One. 
RIKER: Lieutenant, contact the Hood and inform them of our delay. 
WORF: Aye, Commander. 
PICARD 2: Belay that order. There will be no further communication off
this ship without my prior authorisation. Commander, may I have a word
with you? Mister Data, you have the bridge. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

PICARD 2: Number One, you know I like to keep you
well informed as to the nature of our missions. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
PICARD 2: And if I don't inform you there is a reason. I don't like
keeping you in the dark, but for the next few days I may not be able to
be as communicative as usual. It may make things difficult for you. 
RIKER: Don't worry about me, sir. I can handle it. 
PICARD 2: And the crew? 
RIKER: You can count on all of us, sir. 
PICARD 2: I appreciate that, Number One.

[Holding cell]

(Picard is tapping on the panel, 2 taps, then 3,
then 5, and so on) 
THOLL: Picard, what are you doing? 
PICARD: Attempting to let our captors know that we possess
intelligence. 
THOLL: You don't think they already know that? They can hear us
talking. 
PICARD: Yes, but they may not realise that we're communicating through
language. 
HARO: Captain Picard is letting them know we comprehend mathematics by
tapping out the first six prime numbers. 
THOLL: I know what he's doing. I'm trying to understand why. 
PICARD: It is imperative that we communicate with our abductors, find
out what they want. 
THOLL: Obviously, they want us. 
PICARD: Obviously. But why? What made our captors choose us? What makes
us special? 
HARO: I couldn't say, Captain. I'm certainly not special. I am just one
cadet. 
PICARD: What's your best area of study? 
HARO: Impulse propulsion systems. I'm very good with field coils. 
PICARD: Good enough to be useful to our abductors? 
HARO: I don't know. Maybe. But if they needed an engineer, sir, why
didn't they take a real one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet? 
PICARD: That I can't answer. The Bolians are maintaining an uneasy
truce with the Moropa, are they not? 
HARO: That's right. But this doesn't look like Moropa technology and,
even assuming the Moropa wanted me, what would they want with either of
you? 
THOLL: I've never even heard of the Moropa. My race has no enemies. 
PICARD: None? In the last three hundred years of Mizarian history, your
planet has been conquered six times! 
THOLL: And we've survived by not resisting. Mizarians value peace above
confrontation. 
PICARD: Then you have no idea who might have done this. 
THOLL: No. I don't know of anyone who bears malice toward my race. 
PICARD: Or against you personally? 
THOLL: You can't mean to suggest that someone with a personal grudge
against me has gone to all this trouble. 
PICARD: I'm not suggesting anything. I'm merely trying to come up with
some explanation for your abduction. 
THOLL: I'm sorry, Picard. I can't give you one. I am neither important
enough to hold for ransom nor radical enough to be dangerous. I'm a
simple public servant. 
PICARD: Nevertheless, Mister Tholl 
(There's a sound and a sparkling, and a figure in leather appears on
the fourth bed. He has lots of red hair and sharp teeth, and pulls a
dagger) 
PICARD: Stop! We mean you no harm. We are prisoners, like yourself. We
are not the enemy. 
ESOQQ: Who has done this? 
PICARD: We don't know. We were brought here the same way you were. Our
captors refuse to show themselves. 
ESOQQ: I don't trust you. 
PICARD: You must trust us. We wish only to return to our worlds. Were
you abducted from Chalna? 
ESOQQ: You know my planet? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. I visited there twelve years ago, while commanding the
Stargazer.

[Data's quarters]

(The senior officer's floating poker game is in
session) 
RIKER: Five, and twenty. 
LAFORGE: Ouch. 
TROI: If it's too rich, Geordi, fold. 
LAFORGE: I'm thinking, I'm thinking. 
(The doorbell rings) 
DATA: Enter. 
PICARD 2: Counsellor, gentlemen. Forgive this intrusion. I was just
passing by. 
DATA: You are always welcome, Captain. 
PICARD 2: I was wondering, Mister La Forge. What's our engine
efficiency status? 
LAFORGE: Operating at ninety three percent, sir. 
PICARD 2: That's very good, but I would like to increase the efficiency
to ninety five percent. 
LAFORGE: No problem, Captain, I'll get right on it. 
PICARD 2: That's not an order. You can get to it later. I don't want to
disrupt your recreation. 
LAFORGE: No Captain, it's no problem. Lady Luck left me long ago. 
(La Forge leaves) 
TROI: Would you care to join us, Captain? We have an opening. 
PICARD 2: I'd rather just observe, if you don't mind. 
RIKER: Not at all. Counsellor, twenty. 
(She and Data see Riker's bid) 
RIKER: Pair of threes. 
TROI: Flush. Queen high. 
DATA: That beats my fours. 
PICARD 2: Well played, Counsellor. May I have a word with you for just
a moment? 
TROI: Certainly, sir. 
PICARD 2: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll return your player to you in a
moment.
