[Holodeck]

(Wesley and Salia are on a planetoid orbiting a
ringed planet) 
SALIA: Can a place so remarkable truly exist? 
WESLEY: Yes. There are many more. All of them are different. 
SALIA: I've learned about them. That's all I did on Klavdia Three, was
learn. I know so much, but I've seen so little. 
WESLEY: Think of what you have to look forward to. This is a great time
to be alive. 
SALIA: For you. 
WESLEY: For both of us. This is all just beginning. We've only charted
nineteen percent of our galaxy. The rest is out there, just waiting.
Look what we've already discovered. 
SALIA: I have never seen anything so wondrous. 
WESLEY: Wait. Computer, Rosseau Five. 
(They are standing on a fragment of rock drifting in a purple haze) 
SALIA: It's breathtaking! 
WESLEY: Yes. 
SALIA: And you've been to this place? 
WESLEY: Someday, you'll visit Rosseau Five, and many other places, all
more spectacular. 
SALIA: If only it were possible. 
WESLEY: Listen. 
SALIA: What is it? 
WESLEY: In a moment, the harmonic resonance from the neutrino clouds
will become synchronous. 
(Musical notes sound) 
SALIA: It's so beautiful! It's like this place has a voice and is
trying to speak to us. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. 
WESLEY: Someday, you'll see it all for yourself. Look over there. 
[Corridor]

(Anya is escorted to Salia's quarters) 
WORF: Remain here. You are restricted to these quarters for the
remainder of this voyage. 
ANYA: You are the protector of this ship, are you not? 
WORF: I am in charge of Security. 
ANYA: You must understand my duties as well. If you confine me to this
cell, I cannot protect Salia. 
WORF: There is no need for concern. She is safe on this ship. 
ANYA: You must understand that I cannot make such an assumption. 
WORF: You no longer have the choice. You have to trust me to protect
her. 
ANYA: No. A true protector cannot have two charges. Your responsibility
is to the ship. My duty is to Salia. 
WORF: My responsibility to the ship includes protecting Salia. 
ANYA: You know I'm stronger than you. 
WORF: I was unprepared. 
ANYA: You underestimated me in your Sickbay. That is usually fatal. 
WORF: Still, you are here, confined to your room. 
ANYA: I ceased my struggle by choice, not because of you or your
Captain. 
WORF: I would have stopped you. If not me, someone else. 
ANYA: No, you cannot control me. 
WORF: We will see. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: We've obviously brought a very dangerous
life form aboard this ship. I want to minimize the chances of any
incident. 
TROI: Whatever kind of life form Anya is, emotionally she's Salia's
mother. 
PICARD: The most dangerous animal is a mother protecting her young. 
TROI: Exactly. 
ANYA [OC]: Captain, this is Anya. 
PICARD: Yes? 
ANYA [OC]: Salia is gone. Where is she?

[Ten forward]

SALIA: This has all been so wonderful. I'm not even
sure it's real. 
WESLEY: Believe me, Ten Forward isn't an illusion. 
SALIA: Not that. I mean the way I feel. 
GUINAN: You won't find a better dish of chocolate anywhere. 
SALIA: I'm sure I won't. 
WESLEY: Is something wrong? 
SALIA: I've had a great time being with you, Wesley. 
WESLEY: And that makes you sad? 
SALIA: When I was on Klavdia Three, all I could think of was leaving
that isolation. What makes me sad is having to face it again after
seeing what else is possible. 
WESLEY: Is that what awaits you on Daled Four? Isolation? 
SALIA: Yes. 
WESLEY: I thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties. 
SALIA: What else do you know? 
WESLEY: Very little. The ship's computer doesn't have that much on
Daled Four. How will you stop the fighting? 
SALIA: I'm not certain. I only know I will have many responsibilities
when I get there. Your language has no word for the position
I'll hold. In many ways I'll have even less freedom than I did on
Klavdia Three. 
WESLEY: You could stay. 
SALIA: On the Enterprise? 
WESLEY: Why not? 
SALIA: Because I can't. 
(Salia leaves) 
GUINAN: Just because a girl runs out, doesn't mean she doesn't wish you
to follow.

[Corridor]

WESLEY: What is it? What happened? Salia! 
SALIA: Stay away from me! I'm sorry. 
WESLEY: I don't understand. 
SALIA: I can't stay here! I can't have this life! I want it more than
anything, but I can't have it! 
WESLEY: Salia, nothing is impossible. 
SALIA: Not for you. 
WESLEY: There's a way. I know there is! 
(Picard, Anya and a guard come round the corner) 
ANYA: Leave her alone! 
PICARD: Ensign, step away from her. 
ANYA: (to Salia) Come with me.
