[Bridge]

PICARD: Status report, Number One? 
RIKER: We've reached the outer regions of the Beta Stromgren system. On
course for orbital intercept of Tin Man, ETA eighteen minutes. 
PICARD: Grand. 
RIKER: Not altogether. Astrophysics reports that the star's rate of
collapse has increased. It could go supernova in the next few days. 
DATA: Captain, we are receiving relayed sensor data from the Vega
Probe, including visuals. 
PICARD: On screen. 
(There's the big, angry orange-red star) 
PICARD: Magnify. 
(And a thing that is built like a magnified hair, with the overlapping
scales) 
PICARD: Remarkable. Computer locate Tam Elbrun. 
COMPUTER: Tam Elbrun is in turbolift one, en route to the main Bridge. 
PICARD: Of course. 
WORF: Captain. Our sensors are detecting a subspace wave front of
highly ionised particles preceding the object which is tracking us. 
(Troi and Tam have entered) 
PICARD: Yellow Alert. On screen. 
(It's green and mean) 
WORF: Romulan warbird closing. They are arming main disruptors,
Captain. 
PICARD: Go to Red Alert. Shields to maximum. 
RIKER: Arm photon torpedoes and stand by, Mister Worf. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: I thought you said the Enterprise was faster than this Romulan. 
DATA: In fact, we are, Commander. However 
PICARD: Evasive, Mister Crusher. Hailing frequencies. 
TAM: I guarantee that they don't want to talk to you, Captain. 
(Weapons hit, and the lights dim. The Romulan makes a strafing run then
heads for the star) 
WORF: The Romulan has passed us. 
PICARD: Damage report. 
WORF: Casualties reported. Seventy percent loss to the shields. 
TAM: Their attack on us was incidental, Captain. 
PICARD: Incidental? 
TAM: Yes. To delay us. 
DATA: Captain, it would appear that the Romulan's intent is to contact
Tin Man first, at any cost. According to my sensor readings, the
warbird has exceeded maximum engine output by thirty percent. They seem
to have irreparable damage to their warp coils. 
RIKER: So they kept up with us by sacrificing their ability to re-enter
Romulan space. 
PICARD: One way trip. 
TAM: There is one more trailing us, Captain. A day or two behind.
Data's right. This one's job is to beat us to Tin Man at any cost. 
PICARD: You read all this, telepathically? 
TAM: In the mind of the Romulan commander during the attack. 
PICARD: Very well. Mister Crusher, all stop. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: Geordi
