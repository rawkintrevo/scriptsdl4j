(it's dark and there are vines and stones here too)

RIKER: Maybe we'd better talk in here. The Observation Lounge has
turned into a swamp. 
PICARD: So, what's our status? 
LAFORGE: Well, so far the archive has transformed about twenty percent
of the ship. We've lost main propulsion and weapons systems in the
process. 
RIKER: What about communications, sensors, life support? 
LAFORGE: We have communications, and limited sensor control. Life
support seems to be unaffected. 
CRUSHER: I've analysed the alien plant forms. They've developed from
biological matter we have on the ship. 
LAFORGE: The stone, the artefacts, are made in much the same way,
extrapolating from the ship's own alloys. 
CRUSHER: Apparently the archive can reorder and transform molecular
structure including DNA into anything it wants. 
PICARD: So it's using our ship, our alloys, our DNA, to create elements
of its own culture. 
TROI: But why is this happening? What does the archive hope to
accomplish? 
PICARD: Well, whatever the intent that lies behind its process, I'm not
going to permit this ship to be turned into an alien city. Mister La
Forge, do you have any ideas? 
LAFORGE: We still haven't been able to cut off that beam, but I have
managed to access the archive by sending an energy pulse back along
their signal path. If I can locate the transformation programme, I
might be able to control it. 
PICARD: That's a good idea, but I feel that the answer lies there, with
Masaka. We must find her, access her. Talk to her.

[Data's quarters]

(a dirt floor and a raised hearth in the middle) 
PICARD: Hello. 
DATA-ELDER: Difficult to stay warm. It's not warm enough, not for an
old man. 
PICARD: Tell me about Masaka. 
DATA-ELDER: My daughter. 
PICARD: Tell me, how can I talk to her? 
DATA-ELDER: Children grow, forget their parents. Only Korgano can talk
to Masaka. 
PICARD: Korgano? Who is that? 
(the fire flares) 
DATA-IHAT: Well, aren't we the persistent one. 
PICARD: Ihat. 
DATA-IHAT: Is anyone else so charming? 
PICARD: Masaka is taking over my ship. 
DATA-IHAT: I told you she would. 
PICARD: I want to talk with her but I understand that Korgano is the
only one who can do that. 
DATA-IHAT: Who told you that? 
PICARD: An old man. Masaka's father. 
DATA-IHAT: Oh, yes, yes. Legend has it she chopped him up and used his
bones to make the world. Any wonder he doesn't like to talk about her? 
PICARD: How can I find Korgano? 
DATA-IHAT: I don't know. He's not chasing her anymore. 
PICARD: Where has he gone? 
DATA-IHAT: Stop asking me these questions. I was fast enough to get
away from her once. I don't want her to find me again. I'll wind up on
her sacrificial slab. 
PICARD: Ihat, if she's looking for a sacrifice, she can take me.
Perhaps then she'll stop looking for you. 
DATA-IHAT: Well, there's an idea. Better you than me. 
PICARD: Very well. What do we do. 
DATA-IHAT: You must build Masaka's temple. The Queen's temple. That
will get her attention. 
PICARD: Very well. How do I do that? 
DATA-IHAT: You need the sign. I could give it to you. So could the old
man. But just try getting it out of him. 
PICARD: Give me the sign. 
DATA-IHAT: If she finds out, you can't imagine her rage. She lets
people die of thirst. A terrible death. Sometimes she burns them alive.
She is glorious. 
PICARD: Ihat, the sign, give it to me. 
DATA-IHAT: If she comes, you will take my place? 
PICARD: Yes. 
DATA-IHAT: All right. Quickly, give me your hand. A line, as the
unending horizon. A curve as. She has found me. 
PICARD: Masaka, show yourself. I will go with you. 
DATA-IHAT: It seems I was not fast enough. 
DATA-ELDER: So hard to stay warm. Are you one of my children? I can't
remember anymore. 
PICARD: I need your help. I need the sign for the temple. For Masaka's
temple. 
DATA-ELDER: It won't help you. Korgano no longer pursues her. Only he
can stop her. 
(Picard takes the old man's hand and draws in the dirt) 
PICARD: A line as the unending horizon. A curve as? A line as the
unending horizon. A curve 
DATA-ELDER: As the rolling hillside. A point as a distant bird. A ray
as the rising sun. 
PICARD: Thank you. 
DATA-ELDER: Now, come sit with me. Tend the fire. 
DATA-BOY: I'm alone. No one left to help me. She's coming. 
PICARD: Are all the others dead? Did Masaka kill them? 
DATA-BOY: No. She sent them away. It will take them days to die. 
(Data no longer has the symbols on him)

(there's nowhere to sit now) 
PICARD: Any progress, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE: I think I've found the archive's transformation programme. 
PICARD: Will it accept the symbol for Masaka's temple? 
LAFORGE: I think so. I've isolated the program's input pathways.
They're keyed to accept symbols. If I input this one, it should
initiate the transformation process. 
RIKER: And create the temple? 
LAFORGE: I hope so. If this is the wrong symbol, it might turn the
Enterprise into a big chunk of rock. No way to know for sure. 
TROI: The question is, can we trust a personality from an alien archive
that seems bent on taking us over? 
PICARD: Ihat risked his life to show me that symbol, and Masaka killed
him for doing it. I think we have to risk it.

[Corridor]

WORF: Captain. The entire deck has been cleared of
personnel. We may proceed. 
PICARD: Commander Riker, we're ready. 
RIKER [OC]: Understood. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Initiate transformation. 
LAFORGE: Inputting the symbol now.
