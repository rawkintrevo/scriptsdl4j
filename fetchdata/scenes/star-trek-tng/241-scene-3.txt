Q PICARD PENNY
little didn look drink ensign contemplating puerile men thoughts

[Bonestell Facility bar]

PENNY: You're awfully quiet today. What happened to
the dashing young Ensign from last night? The one with the winning
smile and the smooth talk about my eyes? 
PICARD: I'm just a little more contemplative. 
PENNY: And what are you contemplating? 
PICARD: Penny, er, do you think we could just talk for a while. I don't
know anything about you. Where you're from, what your interests are,
your last name. 
PENNY: I come from Rigel, my last name is Muroc and I like men in
uniform. I think that's enough talking. 
(the older woman moves in for a kiss) 
PENNY: What's wrong? I don't look as attractive to you as I did last
night? 
PICARD: No, no, not at all. I think you're a very handsome woman. 
PENNY: Handsome. That's something you say to old ladies. 
PICARD: You're certainly not an old lady. 
(she throws her drink in his face) 
PENNY: I didn't want your pity. 
(Penny leaves in high dudgeon. The bartender has a new face.) 
Q: Penny for your thoughts? You never told me you were such a lady's
man. 
PICARD: I wasn't. I was a puerile adolescent who allowed himself to be
led by his hormones instead of his head. 
Q: Looks like your friends know how to have fun. You ought to take
lessons. 
(The gang are playing a variation of pool where the ball bounces off
coloured lights on the table) 
Q: Excuse me.
