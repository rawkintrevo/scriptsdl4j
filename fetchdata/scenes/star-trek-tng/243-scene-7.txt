(Two Romulans track Worf) 
ROMULAN: There. 
(Worf spots Shrek and his little ship but is jumped by Toq! He
restrains from hurting the boy and the Romulans catch him)

Captain's log, stardate 46759.2. The Yridian vessel
Lieutenant Worf boarded at Deep Space Nine has failed to arrive for our
scheduled rendezvous. It is now twelve hours overdue.

[Bridge]

RIKER: Still no sign of them on long range
scanners. 
PICARD: Contact DS9. Find out what they know about this Yridian trader.

RIKER: Hopefully he filed a flight plan before he left the station. 
PICARD: That's the only chance we have of finding Worf. 
[Meeting hall]

TOKATH: We haven't had to use one of these for a
long time. It implants a small boridium pellet under the skin. (he
injects Worf) We can
use its energy signature to track you. 
L'KOR: In time, you will grow accustomed to life here. 
WORF: Never. 
TOKATH: He is one of yours. Deal with him however you like. But I warn
you, if he becomes a disruption, I will not be so tolerant. 
L'KOR: Toq. You guard him. He is free to move around inside the
compound. But make certain he does not cause trouble. 
[Compound]

(Worf does his martial art routine) 
BA'EL: What are you doing? 
WORF: This is the mok'bara. The form clears the mind and centres the
body. 
(Ba'el tries to copy him) 
WORF: No. Like this. First you must learn to breathe. Stand tall. As
tall as you can. Now, take a wider stance. 
TOQ: You must stop. 
(Worf throws the boy over his shoulder) 
WORF: These forms are the basis for Klingon combat. You would be wise
to learn them. I will teach you. Join us. 
TOQ: We'll see what L'Kor thinks of this.
