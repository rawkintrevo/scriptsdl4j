[Bridge]

DATHON [on viewscreen]: Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai
of Lowani. Lowani under two moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of crossed
roads at Lungha. Lungha, her sky grey. Rai and Jiri at Lungha. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: I'm sense nothing but good intentions from them, Captain. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: The Tamarian seems to be stating the proper names of individuals
and locations. 
PICARD: Yes, but what does it all mean? 
DATA: I am at a loss, sir. 
PICARD: Captain, would you be prepared to consider the creation of a
mutual non-aggression pact between our two peoples, possibly leading to
a trade agreement and cultural interchange. Does this sound like a
reasonable course of action to you? 
(the Tamarian crew find this funny) 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Kadir beneath Mo Moteh. 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: The river Temarc! In winter. 
(that wipes the smiles off their races) 
PICARD: Impressions, Number One? 
RIKER: It appears they're trying their best. 
PICARD: As are we. For what it's worth. 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Shaka, when the walls fell. (to his officer)
Darmok. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: (aghast) Darmok? Rai and Jiri at Lungha! 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Shaka. When the walls fell. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Zima at Anzo. Zima and Bakor. 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Darmok at Tanagra. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Shaka! Mirab, his sails unfurled. 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Darmok. 
GUEST0 [on viewscreen]: Mirab. 
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Temarc! The river Temarc. 
(Dathon takes his aides dagger, and his own, and holds them
out)
DATHON [on viewscreen]: Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra. 
(Dathon beams away, then Picard) 
RIKER: Block their transporter with the shields! Extend to maximum
range! 
WORF: Not enough time. 
RIKER: Where is he? 
DATA: The Tamarians have transported Captain Picard to the planet
surface along with their own captain. 
RIKER: Riker to O'Brien. 
DATA: It will not be possible to transport, sir. The Tamarian ship has
created a particle scattering field on the planet's ionosphere. 
RIKER: Riker to Captain Picard. Captain, do you read me? Can we
compensate? 
DATA: No, sir. The Tamarians are projecting a particle sustaining beam
into the upper atmosphere. The result is a hyperionisation that
virtually disrupts all EM and subspace carriers. 
RIKER: Then they can't communicate with their man either. They won't be
able to beam anyone through the field. 
DATA: That is correct. However, they have left sensor frequencies
clear. 
RIKER: Then they'll be able to tell what's going on. Analysis, Mister
Worf. What the hell is going on? 
WORF: A contest, perhaps. Between champions. Our captain against
theirs. 
RIKER: Theirs was armed.
