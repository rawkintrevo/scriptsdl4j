SUNAD [on viewscreen]: Picard, we will not tolerate
more delays. 
PICARD: Commander, let me remind you we are on a mission of
exploration. Our purpose is to establish peaceful relations with the
civilisations we encounter. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: We do not want relations with you. 
PICARD: If that is your wish, we will respect it. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: We simply want you to leave Zalkonian space as
soon as you return the criminal. 
PICARD: Commander, we will leave. It is not our policy to intervene in
the affairs of other cultures. But before I return the survivor to you,
I would appreciate a more detailed explanation of what he has done to
merit a death sentence. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: As I said. it is not your concern. 
PICARD: Agreed. However, there are circumstances of which you may be
unaware. The survivor has suffered a memory loss. He's therefore
ill-equipped to defend himself against your accusations. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: There is no defence. Our judgment is final. 
PICARD: There's something else. Since his recovery, he's manifested
unusual abilities. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: What kind of abilities? 
PICARD: He apparently has the power to heal injuries with a simple
touch. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: Lies. 
PICARD: And even to reverse death itself. 
SUNAD [on viewscreen]: Obviously he has corrupted you as well. I see I
am wasting my time.

CRUSHER: I can't breathe. 
(He gives her the golden glow) 
JOHN: It's come back to me, Beverly. I know who I am. What I am.

transmits his golden glow through the computer interface to the entire
ship)
