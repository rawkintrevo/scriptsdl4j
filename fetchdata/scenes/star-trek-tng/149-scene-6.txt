RIKER: Got it. The Artemis. Launched ninety two
years ago. Destination Septimus Minor. When they failed to check in,
Starfleet began an extensive search. 
PICARD: What carried the Artemis 
[Planet surface]

PICARD [OC]: So far off course?
DATA: My local informant does not have that information. In the early
days on Tau Cygna Five, survival was more important than history. 
PICARD [OC]: Understood. How many are there? 
DATA: Fifteen thousand two hundred fifty three, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Fifteen thousand! 
RIKER: Three days, no transporters. We'll never get them out in time. 
PICARD: Shuttles? 
WORF: Loading all the Enterprise shuttlecraft to capacity, evacuation
will take four weeks, four days. 
PICARD: We need more time. Mister Data, prepare the colonists for an
evacuation. 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Get me the Sheliak. 
WORF: Their home world is quite distant, Captain. This will take some
time.

pool) 
HARITATH: Gosheven, look what's come. 
DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. 
KENTOR: He's an android. 
GOSHEVEN: So he is. Well, now that you're here, what do you want? 
DATA: My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. 
GOSHEVEN: Why? 
DATA: Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. 
GOSHEVEN: And who is this Sheliak? 
DATA: The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid, intelligent
life form, classification R3. 
GOSHEVEN: Well, this colony's been here over ninety years. We've never
seen a Sheliak. I'd say that makes Tau Cygna Five our planet. 
DATA: The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. 
GOSHEVEN: The guidance system on the Artemis failed. Took them off
course. Far off course. Our ancestors were lucky to find any place to
land. 
HARITATH: And when they did, the radiation started killing them. 
GOSHEVEN: Hyperonic radiation took the lives of a third of the
colonists before they learned they could adapt to it. 
KENTOR: But our colony survived and prospered. 
GOSHEVEN: Look around. We have brought water to the desert, built a
community. 
DATA: Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet the Sheliak and
the Federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet Sheliak
domain. 
GOSHEVEN: Then change the treaty. 
DATA: That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonise this
planet, and are unwilling to share it with humans. If you are still
here when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you. 
HARITATH: They'd kill all of us? 
DATA: They have little regard for human life. Thus, the most sensible
course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your
people. 
GOSHEVEN: We're not evacuating. 
DATA: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. 
GOSHEVEN: Yes, you have. Let me be equally clear. There's going to be
no evacuation. You've delivered your message, so go back to your ship.
I have work to do. 
(Gosheven goes back to his discussion and an object is thrown at Data.
He catches it) 
ARD'RIAN: Nice catch. Wonderful reflexes. Sorry to test you like that,
but I was curious. 
(It is a young woman in breeches and braces) 
GOSHEVEN: Found a new toy, have we, Ardi? 
ARD'RIAN: Toy? This is the most incredible android I've ever seen. 
DATA: Have you seen many? 
ARD'RIAN: Actually, no. You're the first. 
GOSHEVEN: Only you would get this excited over a walking calculator. 
ARD'RIAN: Cybernetic intelligence fascinates me. Are your neural
pathways duotronic? 
DATA: No, positronic. 
ARD'RIAN: I didn't know that was possible! What's your memory capacity?
How many operations per second? I have a million questions. 
DATA: I'm afraid I have no time to answer a million questions. I have a
mission to accomplish. I need to know more about your people, and
Gosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further. 
ARD'RIAN: I'm Ard'rian McKenzie. Perhaps I can help you.
