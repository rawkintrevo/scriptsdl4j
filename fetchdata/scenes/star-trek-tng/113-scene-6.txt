[Observation Lounge]

PICARD: And when I looked down into the street, I
actually saw automobiles! 
WORF: Automobiles? 
DATA: An ancient Earth device used primarily for transportation. 
WORF: Ah. 
DATA: Also seen as a source of status and virility. Often a prime
ingredient in teenage mating rituals. 
WESLEY: Teenage mating rituals? 
PICARD: From that window, I could see an entire, er 
DATA: City block. 
PICARD: That's right. Sounds, Smells. 
CRUSHER: You make it sound so
real. 
PICARD: That's how it felt. 
CRUSHER: Incredible. 
(She wipes the lipstick off his face) 
PICARD: I'm going to go again, only this time I'm going to dress the
part. Why not come with me? 
CRUSHER: Yes, I'd like that. 
PICARD: I want to take that twentieth century historian. 
CRUSHER: Who? Whalen? 
PICARD: Yes, Whalen. I bet he knows more about Dixon Hill than I do. 
DATA: Shall I tell him, sir? 
PICARD: Invite him, Mister Data. This is supposed to be a recreational
activity. The sense of reality was absolutely incredible. When that
woman kissed me, it was so 
CRUSHER: Exciting? 
PICARD: Real. The subject of this meeting is the Jaradan rendezvous.
Mister Riker, will you go ahead with the briefing. 
RIKER: This is primarily a diplomatic mission. The Jaradan are
strategically important to the Federation. Previous attempts have
failed because they are so easily irritated. A slip in the
pronunciation of the greeting caused a twenty year rift. 
TROI: The Captain has to recite the entire greeting without making any
mistakes. 
LAFORGE: Simple as that, huh? 
DATA: Yes. If, on the other hand, the Captain makes even the slightest
error 
TROI: The Captain is well aware of the gravity of the situation,
Commander. 
DATA: We are all aware of the tape of the last Federation starship to
come in contact with the Jaradan. It graphically demonstrates what
happened when that Captain offended them. 
TROI: Captain Picard is familiar with that, Data. 
DATA: Should we not rerun it? 
PICARD: It's not necessary, Mister Data. Meeting adjourned.

[Corridor]

DATA: Why would the Captain not want to review all
available information on the subject? 
LAFORGE: Data, when you've seen the Jaradan react once, you don't ever
have to see it again. 
DATA: This Dixon Hill is a most puzzling character. 
LAFORGE: Not really. He was just a twentieth-century Sherlock Holmes. 
DATA: Ah, but was his modus operandi not dissimilar? Worth
investigating. 
LAFORGE: Indubitably, my dear Data. Indubitably.
