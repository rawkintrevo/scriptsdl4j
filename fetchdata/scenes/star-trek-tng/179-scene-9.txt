CRUSHER: I can't believe that Chief O'Brien might
be lying. 
RIKER: He believes what he says. And there is no trace imprint for
Doctor Quaice. 
CRUSHER: Will, I didn't conjure up one of my best friends from a test

RIKER: If the ship's records have been tampered with, then transporter
records could have been changed as well. 
CRUSHER: And with everybody coming and going yesterday, maybe O'Brien
just doesn't remember, or 
RIKER: Or? 
CRUSHER: It might be a good idea to run a diagnostic on him. 
RIKER: To make sure he wasn't tampered with? 
CRUSHER: What do you think? 
RIKER: It's worth a try. I'll check the replicator activity logs.
Eighteen hours is a long time to go without food. Or without someone
seeing him.

CRUSHER: Chief, this examination should only take a
few minutes. 
O'BRIEN: But I feel fine. 
CRUSHER: Sit down. 
O'BRIEN: Doctor, it's no use checking my eyesight. I didn't see your
friend. 
CRUSHER: I'll be a little more comprehensive than that, Chief. Doctor
Crusher to Doctor Hill. Respond, please. Doctor Selar, your present
location? Computer, current whereabouts of Doctors Hill and Selar. 
COMPUTER: There is no Doctor Hill or Doctor Selar aboard the
Enterprise.
