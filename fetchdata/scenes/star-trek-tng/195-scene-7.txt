LAFORGE WORF JDAN PICARD SABIN SATIE DATA

[Transporter room]

(an older woman in a long red robe beams in with a
male and female escort) 
SATIE: Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Admiral Satie. Welcome aboard the Enterprise. 
SATIE: Delighted to be here. I managed to acquire my former staff. My
aide, Sabin Genestra, from Betazed, and my assistant, Nellen Tore, from
Delb Two. 
PICARD: This is my First Officer, Commander William Riker. May I show
you to your quarters? 
SATIE: Captain, if Starfleet Command is so concerned with your report
they brought me out of retirement, I think I should get right to work. 
PICARD: Very well. Commander Riker, will you see to the Admiral's
staff? 
SATIE: First, I'd like to inspect the damage to your engine room.

[Engineering]

PICARD: Admiral Satie, this is Commander Data,
Commander La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Admiral. We still can't get in there, Captain. The radiation
levels are dropping, but they're too high to raise the isolation door. 
PICARD: How much longer will it be? 
DATA: At the rate the levels are decreasing, we will gain entry in
forty nine hours, Captain. 
LAFORGE: Maybe the Admiral would like to see the visual log of the
explosion. 
SATIE: Yes. 
LAFORGE: This was logged four days ago at oh three hundred hours. 
(a picture on the monitor of the warp core, labelled sensor log
playback 44765.3 03.00.59.941. Part of the core goes bang) 
LAFORGE: At that point the emergency confinement field was activated
and the isolation doors came down. No one was killed, but I have two
people in Sickbay with radiation burns. 
SATIE: Have you been able to make any assessments? 
DATA: Slow motion study of the explosion suggests that the articulation
frame collapsed. 
SATIE: The schematics that were stolen from the Enterprise, I believe
some involved the articulation frame of the dilithium chamber. 
PICARD: That's one reason we tend to suspect sabotage. 
DATA: Other evidence lends credence to that theory, Captain. A review
of the sensor logs indicates that every systems reading was well within
normal parameters until fifty two milliseconds before the explosion. 
LAFORGE: We haven't found anything that suggests there was a
malfunction anywhere along the line. 
SATIE: Captain, I think I'm going to need a full briefing before we go
any further. 
PICARD: By all means, Admiral. 
SATIE: Commander Data, La Forge, I don't envy you your job. Good luck.

[Ready room]

PICARD: There are disturbing overtones in the idea
of a Klingon providing information to the Romulans. Are you aware of
any other Klingon-Romulan connection that Starfleet Command might have
encountered recently? 
SATIE: I don't believe what Starfleet Command knows or doesn't know is
for me to reveal. 
PICARD: This ship has encountered several incidents which might suggest
a potential alliance between those two powers. 
SATIE: We're aware of that, Captain. What we must concentrate on is the
business at hand. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Come. 
WORF: Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know that 
PICARD: Please, Mister Worf, come in. I particularly want my guest to
meet you. Admiral Satie. This is my Head of Security, Lieutenant Worf. 
WORF: Captain, I have been pursuing the investigation of Lieutenant
J'Dan. I believe I know how he transferred information off the
Enterprise. 
SATIE: Well done, Lieutenant. 
WORF: (hands over a hypospray) This is J'Dan's. A hypospray he uses to
treat his Ba'ltmasor Syndrome. But this has been fitted with an optical
reader specially modified to read data from Starfleet isolinear chips.
He can extract digital information from a computer, encode it in the
form of amino acid sequences, and transfer those sequences into a fluid
in the syringe. Then he injects someone, perhaps even without their
knowledge. 
SATIE: Or perhaps with their knowledge. 
WORF: The information would be carried in their bloodstream in the form
of inert proteins. 
SATIE: The body itself becomes a conveyor of top secret files.
Lieutenant Worf, when we confront J'Dan, I want you to conduct the
interrogation. 
WORF: I would be honoured. Captain. Admiral. 
(Worf leaves) 
SATIE: Captain, I predict that officer will be extremely valuable in
this investigation.

[Interrogation room]

WORF: I have tracked the movements of every person
who has left the Enterprise since you have been here. I traced one
Tarkanian diplomat as far as the Cruces system where he disappeared and
has not been seen since. 
J'DAN: That proves nothing. 
WORF: A hyposyringe was discovered in your quarters. 
J'DAN: I take injections. Everyone knows that. 
WORF: But your injections do not include an optical chip reader. This
device has but one function, to transform computer information into
biological sequences. 
J'DAN: The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation
alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are
strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into
weaklings like you. 
SATIE: Lieutenant, how did you damage the dilithium chamber? 
J'DAN: I had nothing to do with that 
SATIE: You mean it was sheer coincidence that it was sabotaged after
you gave the plans for the design to the Romulans? 
J'DAN: I do not know. I had nothing to do with it. 
SATIE: You've admitted your crime. Why lie now? 
J'DAN: I am not lying. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, you may have him confined. 
(Worf and J'Dan leave) 
SATIE: Sabin? 
SABIN: I believe he's telling the truth. He admits stealing the files
but not sabotaging the dilithium chamber. I get no sense that he's
lying. 
PICARD: But if you're right, someone else may be involved. 
SATIE: I think, Captain, you have a bigger problem on your ship than
one Klingon exchange officer.
