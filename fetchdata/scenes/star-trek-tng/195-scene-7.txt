[Observation lounge]

WORF: J'Dan did not make friends easily. There are
not many to question. 
GUEST2: You've done a thorough job, Lieutenant. 
WORF: I am strongly motivated in this matter. 
GUEST2: Yes, I can see that. I don't mind telling you I'm surprised.
Frankly, when I first heard about your father. 
WORF: My father? 
GUEST2: Yes. There are some who believe he betrayed your people to the
Romulans. 
WORF: What he did or did not do is no one's concern but my own 
GUEST2: Of course. I only meant before I saw you in action, I naturally
considered you a possible security risk. But I want you to know you
have the Admiral's and my complete confidence. You have nothing to
prove to us. 
WORF: If there is a conspiracy on board, I promise you I will find it. 
GUEST2: Good. You know the ship, you know the personnel, you know
exactly what we're up against. We're counting on you, Lieutenant. 
WORF: I will arrange for the interviews to begin.

[Interrogation room]

SATIE: And how often did Lieutenant J'Dan come in
for his injections? 
CRUSHER: About once a week. 
SATIE: Did you administer them yourself? 
CRUSHER: No. 
SATIE: Then who did? 
CRUSHER: I had one of my assistants do that. 
GUEST2: Did you ever hear him say anything? Anything that may have
seemed innocent at the time that might now shed some light on this
investigation? 
CRUSHER: No, nothing. In fact, he rarely spoke at all. 
PICARD: Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we appreciate your time. You are
excused now. Mister Worf, will you bring in the next person? 
(Crusher leaves and a young man enters) 
PICARD: Please sit down, Mister Tarses. For the record, will you tell
us your name and position? 
GUEST0: Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class, medical technician. 
PICARD: I assure you this is an informal inquiry. We are not accusing
you of anything. However, if you would like counsel, it can be provided
for you. 
GUEST0: No, sir. I have nothing to hide. 
PICARD: Tell me, how long have you held your appointment onboard this
vessel? 
GUEST0: Since Stardate 43587. 
SATIE: Mister Tarses, your records state that you were born on Mars
Colony. 
GUEST0: That's right. 
SATIE: Then you are human? 
GUEST0: Largely. My paternal grandfather was Vulcan. 
SATIE: Yes, I see that. Tell me, what is your relationship with the
Klingon, J'Dan? 
GUEST0: Er, he, I mean, there's no relationship. He just came in for
his injections. 
SATIE: Did you give him those injections? 
GUEST0: Sometimes. There were several of us. Actually, I might have
done it twice. 
GUEST2: Did he ever make any comments that might, in retrospect, be
suspicious? 
GUEST0: Not really. He hardly ever talked. 
SATIE: Did you ever see him outside Sickbay? 
GUEST0: Once or twice in Ten Forward, with a group of people, but I
never had a conversation with him. 
SATIE: Thank you, Mister Tarses. I don't think there's need for more.
Captain? 
PICARD: You're excused, crewman. 
(Tarses leaves) 
PICARD: Mister Worf? 
GUEST2: Wait. He's lying. He's desperately frightened. He's covering
something. 
PICARD: It's clear that he's frightened, but that's hardly an
indication 
GUEST2: It's more than that. He wasn't truthful. He's covering a lie.
One so big it's overwhelming him. I think we've found the man.
