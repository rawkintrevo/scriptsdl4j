[Ready room]

WORF: Sir, I have several teams conducting a deck
by deck search. It is not yet complete. 
DATA: I have scanned the entire ship, Captain. Other than the
Enterprise's regular complement, I can find no one else onboard. 
CRUSHER: Your sensors wouldn't detect him if he were dead. 
DATA: That is correct, Doctor. 
PICARD: Could your friend have returned to the starbase without telling
you? An emergency of some sort? 
CRUSHER: There were a lot of people going back and forth between the
ship and the starbase yesterday. 
DATA: We can easily check the transporter ID traces. 
PICARD: By all means check the trace log. But even if the results are
negative, contact Starbase Command. We should leave nothing to chance. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Data and Worf leave) 
PICARD: One moment, Doctor. I'm sure you are aware of the procedure
involving passengers. 
CRUSHER: Of course. I don't know why Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about
Doctor Quaice. 
PICARD: I was not informed either. 
CRUSHER: But I sent in a request weeks ago. 
PICARD: Then it must have been intercepted before it reached me. 
CRUSHER: And someone else sent the approval? Why? 
PICARD: Doctor Quaice had been stationed at the starbase for some time?

CRUSHER: Six years. 
PICARD: Perhaps it would be prudent to find out if he'd acquired any
enemies there.

RIKER: Course laid in for Durenia Four, sir. 
PICARD: Thank you, Number One. Mister Data? 
DATA: Sir, Starbase one three three has no record at all of a Doctor
Dalen Quaice. 
PICARD: You said he was stationed there for six years. 
DATA: Not according to their computer. I have also accessed Starfleet
records. There is no doctor currently serving in Starfleet named
Quaice. In fact, I can find no service record whatsoever. There are no
birth records with that name. I find no 
CRUSHER: Data, I interned with him on Delos Four. I've known him for
fifteen years. 
DATA: I do not doubt you, Doctor, but I have tried one hundred seventy

CRUSHER: His name is Dalen Quaice. Q U A I C E. Whatever your records
say, they're wrong. 
PICARD: Mister Worf? 
WORF: We have completed our search, Captain. We cannot locate Doctor
Quaice. 
RIKER: You're not alone. 
CRUSHER: He was on board. I met him myself in Transporter room three. 
PICARD: Then it appears, for reasons unknown, someone has gone to great
pains to erase all traces of this man. 
RIKER: Who was on transporter duty when he came aboard?
