RIKER LAFORGE WORF PICARD SALIA GUINAN WESLEY GUARD DATA ANYA

[Bridge]

(Worf is roaring) 
WORF: That is how the Klingon lures a mate. 
WESLEY: Are you telling me to go yell at Salia? 
WORF: No. Men do not roar. Women roar. Then they hurl heavy objects.
And claw at you. 
WESLEY: What does the man do? 
WORF: He reads love poetry. He ducks a lot. 
WESLEY: Worf, sounds like it works great for the Klingons, but I think
I need to try something a little less dangerous. 
WORF: Then go to her door. Beg like a human. 
DATA: It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance it is
likely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, there
could be a difference in the histocompatibility complex in the cell
membrane, but. 
WESLEY: Data, I want to meet her, not dissect her. 
(Wesley leaves as Picard enters) 
PICARD: Picard to Salia's quarters. 
SALIA [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
PICARD: May I activate the viewer? 

[Salia's quarters]

SALIA: Hurry, go, go. 
(The little furry creature runs out of the room) 
SALIA: Certainly. 
PICARD: (on monitor) We've invited Anya to take a tour of the ship.
Maybe you would like to join her? 
SALIA: Very much. 
PICARD: (on monitor) Your escort will with you shortly. Picard out. 
SALIA: I think I'll go on the tour. 
(The creature runs back in, chattering) 
SALIA: Why can't I? This is the only chance I'll ever have to see a
vessel like this. 
(The little creature morphs into Anya) 
ANYA: No. You must remain here where it is safe. Salia, do an old woman
a favour and obey me for the rest of this trip. 
SALIA: You are no more an old woman than I am a leader. 
(Doorbell) 
SALIA: Yes. Come in. 
WORF: I'm here to escort you on a tour of the Enterprise. 
ANYA: Salia will remain behind. I will be right there. You are a
leader. And I am older than you could ever imagine.

[Ten forward]

WESLEY: What should I say? How do I act? What do I
do? 
RIKER: Guinan, I need your help. Could you step over here a minute? 
GUINAN: Sounds simple enough. 
(They sit at a table) 
RIKER: (to Wesley) Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most
important. You may want to start with something like this. (Riker sits
opposite Guinan) You are the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. But
that might not work. 
GUINAN: Yes. Yes, it would. 
RIKER: You don't know how long I've longed to tell you that. 
GUINAN: But you were afraid? 
RIKER: Yes. 
GUINAN: Of me? 
RIKER: Of us. Of what we might become. 
WESLEY: Commander? 
RIKER: or that you might think that was a line. 
GUINAN: Maybe I do think it's a line. 
RIKER: Then you think I'm not sincere? 
GUINAN: I didn't say that. There's nothing wrong with a line. It's like
a knock at the door. 
RIKER: Then you're inviting me in? 
GUINAN: I'm not sending you away. 
RIKER: That's more than I expected. 
GUINAN: Is it as much as you hoped? 
RIKER: To hope is to recognise the possibility. I had only dreams. 
GUINAN: Dreams can be dangerous. 
RIKER: Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are stars,
and the universe worships the night. 
GUINAN: Careful. Putting me on a pedestal so high, you may not be able
to reach me. 
RIKER: Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart in my day and the
soul in my night. 
WESLEY: I don't think this is my style. 
GUINAN: Shut up, kid. Tell me more about my eyes.

[Engineering]

(Geordi is doing what Wesley should have been
doing, when Anya and Worf enter) 
WORF: This is the dilithium crystal chamber. Our Chief Engineer, Geordi
La Forge.

ANYA: What is that? What are you doing? 
LAFORGE: Nothing to be concerned about. Just performing some routine
adjustments. 
ANYA: I wasn't aware that the deuterium control conduit required
routine adjustments. 
(She goes up in the lift to join Geordi) 
LAFORGE: I perform periodic inspections on all engineering systems. 
ANYA: In this case you seem to have found a malfunction. 
LAFORGE: It's not a malfunction. It's simply that a minute defocused
area has developed. It lowers our operating efficiency. 
ANYA: It could also lead to excess prion production. 
LAFORGE: Our computer would detect that. 
ANYA: Unless, of course, it too is malfunctioning. 
LAFORGE: Look, I really have to get this finished. 
WORF: Anya. Please come with me. 
ANYA: I will be back to check your progress. 
[Corridor]

(Outside Salia's quarters, Wesley is stopped by the
security guard) 
GUARD: Ensign Crusher, what can I do for you? 
WESLEY: Nothing. 
(The door opens, eyes meet, a jaw drops) 
GUARD: Is there a problem? 
WESLEY: No. 
SALIA: Could you show me how to work the food dispenser? 
WESLEY: Sure.
