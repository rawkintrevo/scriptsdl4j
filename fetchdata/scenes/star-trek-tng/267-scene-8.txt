bio grew deflector civilian commander wrong aboard territory border

[Ten Forward]

(at the bar) 
SITO: I only filled in at Ops for a half hour, but I had to degauss the
main deflector dish, recalibrate the navigation grid, and use internal
sensors to find a lost puppy. 
WORF: Ops is a very different challenge from Tactical. 
SITO: I can't figure out why I'm even being considered for this
assignment. I'm a security officer. 
WORF: I recommended you. 
SITO: I'll try not to let you down, sir. 
(at a table) 
LAVELLE: What could they be talking about? 
TAURIK: Have you ever considered learning to lip read? 
LAVELLE: You think Worf's chewing her out? 
BEN: No, he always looks like that. 
LAVELLE: Maybe he's giving her pointers on how to land the Ops
position. 
(Riker enters) 
BEN: Hi, Will. 
RIKER: Ben. (to bartender) How you doing? 
LAVELLE: You call him Will? 
BEN: Why not? 
LAVELLE: He's second in command of this ship, that's why not. 
BEN: I'm not Starfleet, I'm a civilian. When he's in here, he wants to
be treated like a civilian. 
LAVELLE: Riker? I bet he sleeps in his uniform. 
BEN: You only think that because he's your CO. If you got to know him. 
LAVELLE: Right. 
TAURIK: He's convinced Commander Riker doesn't like him. 
BEN: Why? Did you crash the ship into something? 
LAVELLE: No. He just doesn't like me. 
TAURIK: He doesn't even know you. 
BEN: That's right. You should go talk to him. 
LAVELLE: About what? 
TAURIK: Perhaps something you have in common. 
BEN: He likes Jazz, poker. He's Canadian. 
LAVELLE: Yeah? My grandfather was from Canada. 
BEN: There you go. 
SITO: Hi. 
LAVELLE: Excuse me, I've got to go talk to somebody. 
(at the bar) 
LAVELLE: Good evening, sir. 
RIKER: Lavelle. Something I can do for you? 
LAVELLE: No, sir. I just came to get another drink. 
RIKER: Is there something wrong with that one? 
LAVELLE: No, actually, I, er. What are you having? 
RIKER: Trakian Ale. 
LAVELLE: Good choice. I'll have one, too. My grandfather was Canadian,
you know. 
RIKER: Really? 
LAVELLE: Aren't you one, too? 
RIKER: A grandfather? 
LAVELLE: No, Canadian, sir. Canadian. 
RIKER: No, I grew up in Alaska. 
LAVELLE: Oh. Well, they both get a lot of snow. 
RIKER: Yeah. 
LAVELLE: It was good talking to you, sir. 
(Lavelle leaves) 
BARTENDER: Your ale, Ensign. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: We're holding position in the Argaya System.

PICARD: Anything? 
WORF: No, sir. I detect no vessels in the vicinity. 
PICARD: How close to the Cardassian border are we? 
DATA: Less than five thousand kilometres, sir. 
WORF: Sir, I am detecting an object five metres in length. It appears
to be an escape pod. 
RIKER: They must have been forced to abandon the ship. 
PICARD: How far inside Cardassian space is it? 
WORF: Fifty thousand kilometres. 
PICARD: How the hell are we going to get it out of there? 
DATA: Sir, the pod's life support system is failing. 
RIKER: Notify Doctor Crusher. 
PICARD: Can we get within transporter range without crossing into
Cardassian territory? 
DATA: We would need to boost the gain on the confinement beam by at
least seven percent. 
PICARD: Mister La Forge?

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I'm on it, Captain. There, try that. 
TAURIK: The pod is still too far away. 
LAFORGE: I'm going to try augmenting the frequency spread. 
TAURIK: Bio readings indicate that passenger's humanoid. Attempting
life form identification. 
LAFORGE: No one told you to do that, Ensign. Let's just get him aboard
safely. There, that should do it. 
TAURIK: Confinement beam's at one hundred nine percent of normal. 
LAFORGE: Transporter room, you should be able to get a lock now. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir.
