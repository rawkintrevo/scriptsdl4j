BOY TROI LAFORGE WORF BYLETH LOQUEL

[Planet surface]

(Picard heads out onto planet hell, gets hit by an
energy strike and knocked out. A figure easily carries him away.)

[Engineering]

WORF: The Engineering sections encompass twelve
decks of the secondary hull. Deck forty two contains the antimatter
storage facility. 
BYLETH: What is the mass flow rate of the antimatter replenishment
stream to the containment pods? 
WORF: Excuse me? 
BYLETH: The antimatter replenishment rate. What is it? 
WORF: I am not certain of the exact rate. 
BYLETH: Perhaps there is someone here who does know the answer. You.
Are you smarter than this one? 
LAFORGE: Why do you ask? 
BYLETH: Never mind. 
BYLETH: I wish to see the Bussard collectors. Take me to them. 
WORF: This way. 
[Corridor]

TROI: This deck is devoted mainly to stellar
cartography, biological research, and astrophysics. We have over a
thousand people on board 
LOQUEL: Are you sure you don't want some of this, this papalla juice? 
TROI: No, thank you. I'm still recovering from all those desserts last
night. 
LOQUEL: Are you sure? It is very delicious. 
TROI: I'm sure. 
LOQUEL: Please, please. You've been so kind. Please. 
(Troi takes the smallest possible sip) 
TROI: Yum. Next we're going to go to deck eight, which is interesting
because it's not really finished. It's sort of a multi-purpose deck.
Sometimes when we need an extra lab or. Ambassador? 
(Troi discovers Loquel is not with her, and goes back to find him
examining a young boy) 
LOQUEL: What is this? 
TROI: It's a child. 
LOQUEL: Child? 
TROI: Children are our offspring. They're our young. They grow into
adults over a period of many years. They grow into beings like us. 
LOQUEL: Offspring. 
TROI: Ambassador, I'm curious. Now does your species procreate? 
LOQUEL: Post-cellular compounding. We emerge from the natal pod fully
grown. 
TROI: I see. 
LOQUEL: Do you have a name? 
BOY: Eric 
LOQUEL: Eric. Do you like dessert? 
(Eric nods, so Loquel addresses his mother) 
LOQUEL: May I give Eric some dessert? 
TROI: That sounds like a wonderful idea. Come on, Eric.
