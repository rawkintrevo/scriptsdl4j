[Kurn's quarters]

KURN: Enter. 
(Worf is at the door) 
KURN: 'el. 
WORF: Permission to speak freely, sir? 
KURN: For what purpose? 
WORF: I have questions I wish to pose. 
KURN: Are your quarters so comfortable? 
WORF: They serve me. 
KURN: This entire ship seems built on comfort, relaxation, being at
ease. It is not the ship of a warrior, not the ship of a Klingon. You
cannot ask these questions within the boundaries of protocol? 
WORF: They are of a personal nature, sir. 
KURN: Permission granted. Pose your questions. 
WORF: I wish to know if I have given you offence. 
KURN: I am not human. If you had given offence, you would not need to
ask. 
WORF: Perhaps I have not performed my duties to your satisfaction? 
KURN: I find you to be a capable Starfleet officer. A credit to your
ship. 
WORF: Yet you dishonour me at every opportunity. 
KURN: Have I? I did not know that being polite to a Starfleet officer
would bring dishonour on him. 
WORF: I am a Klingon. 
KURN: Really? Perhaps your blood has thinned in this environment. I
simply don't want to hurt you. 
(Worf throws a chair across the room in rage) 
KURN: mev yap! So your blood is not so thin after all. 
WORF: I am a Klingon! if you doubt it, a demonstration can be arranged.

KURN: That is the response of a Klingon. The response I would expect
from my older brother. 
(collective gasps and a quick advert break) 
KURN: I was barely a year old when you left for the Khitomer Outpost.
You, our mother and father were not going to stay long. It was decided
that I did not need to go. I was left to stay with our father's friend,
Lorgh, until you returned. You never did. 
WORF: The Starfleet officer that rescued me was told by the Klingon
High Command that I had no living relatives. 
KURN: They assumed that I was killed with the family at Khitomer. Lorgh
had no sons. He took me into his family. It was not until I had reached
the Age of Ascension that I was told the truth. 
WORF: So you asked to serve aboard the Enterprise to watch me. 
KURN: It was an excellent opportunity to see what kind of Klingon you
were, or if you were Klingon at all. 
WORF: Your deception offends me, brother. 
KURN: It should. But it was required. 
WORF: To satisfy your curiosity. 
KURN: No. Much more. You are the eldest son. The challenge is yours to
make. 
WORF: Challenge? 
KURN: The Klingon High Council has judged our father a traitor to the
Empire.
