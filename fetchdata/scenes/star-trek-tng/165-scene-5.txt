WORF: Sensors picking up asteroidal debris ahead,
Commander. 
KURN: Can you identify the coordinates, Mister Worf? 
WORF: Bearing zero zero one mark point oh three. Range, three hundred
thousand kilometres. 
KURN: Excellent. Please scan the asteroid field for me, Lieutenant, and
report. 
WORF: Approximately two thousand small objects. None in our direct
flight path, sir. 
KURN: So, no course correction is necessary. Is that what you are
saying? 
WORF: It should not be needed, sir. 
KURN: Very good, Lieutenant. You handled that well. 
(Worf starts to square up to him) 
KURN: Yes?

RIKER: Commander. Captain's mess? 
KURN: Yes. 
RIKER: Resume. 
RIKER: Your knowledge of our systems and procedures is very impressive,
Sir. I would like to make one suggestion, sir. 
KURN: A suggestion? 
RIKER: When I served aboard the Pagh, the hardest part for me was
recognising and adapting to the demands of the crew. They needed an
iron hand. I imagine it must be very difficult for you to work with a
crew that is so different. I would be happy to guide you in that
regard, if it would be helpful. 
KURN: No, Commander. It wouldn't.
