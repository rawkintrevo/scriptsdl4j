PICARD: I'm glad you could join us, Mister Barclay.
Your report, Mister La Forge. 
LAFORGE: Each of the telescope's subspace antenna clusters is powered
by its own fusion reactor, but a single computer controls them all. 
RIKER: So all eighteen reactors were affected when the computer was
damaged? 
LAFORGE: That's right. They're starting to overload, and could
eventually go critical. The explosion would destroy the Array, and I
wouldn't want to be next door when that happens. 
DATA: A standard isolation procedure would be advisable. 
LAFORGE: I agree. We'll cut off each reactor from the damaged control
system and repair them one by one. 
RIKER: How long will that take? 
LAFORGE: Two to three weeks at least. 
PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge. 
BARCLAY: I don't agree. We could repair all of the reactors
simultaneously instead of one by one. 
PICARD: Simultaneously? All eighteen? 
BARCLAY: Yes, sir. 
LAFORGE: But the Argus computer is inoperable. 
BARCLAY: Not entirely. The core memory is still intact, and we could
programme a completely new control system. 
DATA: An interesting suggestion, Lieutenant. However, that approach
would require much more time than our original plan. At least seven
weeks. 
BARCLAY: I could have it ready for you in two days. 
RIKER: What? 
BARCLAY: If you could assist me in the morning, Commander. 
LAFORGE: Sure, Reg.

[Ship's theatre]

(an acting workshop, and Barclay is in award
winning mode) 
BARCLAY: The moon, yes, that'll be my home, my paradise. I shall find
there all the souls I love. Socrates, Galileo. And when I arrive they
will question my worthiness. What the devil is he doing there among us?
Philosopher, scientist, poet, musician, duellist! Here lies Hercule
Savinien De Cyrano de Bergerac. I would not have you weep any less for
that charming, good, and handsome Christien. I only ask this, that as
the great cold surrounds my bones, you allow a double meaning for your
mourning veil. And when you let fall your tears fall for him, some few
will be for me. 
CRUSHER: That was a real improvement. 
BARCLAY: Same time, day after tomorrow? 
CRUSHER: Same time.

[Ten Forward]

TROI: Reg? May I join you? 
BARCLAY: Of course, please. Sit down, Counsellor. 
TROI: Hard at work? 
BARCLAY: I'm getting prepared for tomorrow's meeting in Engineering.
We're planning our repair strategy. 
TROI: I really enjoyed the scene you just performed. 
BARCLAY: You're a very forgiving audience. 
TROI: Not at all. I thought you were brilliant. You've changed. 
BARCLAY: Is that a professional opinion? 
TROI: Pure observation. 
BARCLAY: No, it's true. I can't explain it. In the last few days I've
found confidence I never knew was there. 
TROI: I'm proud of you, Reg. I'm glad for you, too. Well, I'd better be
going. 
BARCLAY: Must you? 
TROI: I think so. 
BARCLAY: Wouldn't you like to take a walk with me through the
arboretum? The zalnias should be in bloom. 
TROI: Reg, as your former counsellor, I don't think it would be
appropriate. 
BARCLAY: I don't need a counsellor. What I need is the company of a
charming, intelligent woman. 
TROI: Goodnight, Mister Barclay.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Where's Lieutenant Barclay? 
LARSON: I stopped by his quarters on my way over. He wasn't there. 
LAFORGE: Computer, location of Lieutenant Barclay. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay is on holodeck three.

[Holodeck]

EINSTEIN: G sub I, J of t as t approaches infinity.

BARCLAY: G of t over G naught. 
EINSTEIN: So it is, so it is. 
BARCLAY: I still don't see how you're going to incorporate quantum
principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological
constant a lot more than you're doing here. 
EINSTEIN: If we increase the value as you suggest, we must face the
possibility of twenty six dimensions, instead of ten. 
BARCLAY: I don't think I could deal with that. 
EINSTEIN: I certainly could not. 
BARCLAY: If the semiset curved into the subatomic, the infinities might
cancel each other out. 
EINSTEIN: Gruss Gott. They just might. 
LAFORGE: We had a meeting at oh seven hundred. 
BARCLAY: I'm sorry, Commander. Thank you, Professor. End programme.
