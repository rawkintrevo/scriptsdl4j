CADET BOOTHBY PICARD WESLEY LOCARNO CRUSHER

[Wesley's room]

(Wesley is using a resistance device to strengthen
his broken arm. There's a knock on the door. He goes to open it by
turning the handle!) 
CRUSHER: Wes. I was so worried about you. 
PICARD: How are you feeling, Wesley? 
WESLEY: Not bad. The arm's a little sore. 
CRUSHER: We were very sorry to hear about Joshua. 
PICARD: Would you like to talk about it? 
WESLEY: No. I don't think so. No, thank you. I know you're trying to be
helpful, sir, but it seems like that's all I've talked about for the
last two days. I don't want to go through it again. 
PICARD: I understand. But I just want you to know I'm available if you
should change your mind. 
WESLEY: Thank you sir. 
(another knock on the door) 
WESLEY: Hi. 
LOCARNO: Hi. 
(enter Robert Duncan McNeill, who will become Tom Paris in Voyager) 
LOCARNO: Captain, sir. 
PICARD: At ease, Cadet. 
WESLEY: This is my squadron leader, Nicholas Locarno. This is Captain
Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise. My mother, Doctor Beverly Crusher. 
LOCARNO: Hello, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Hello. 
LOCARNO: Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Mister Locarno. 
LOCARNO: I came by to see if Wes had healed up all right. 
CRUSHER: And how are you feeling, Nicholas? 
LOCARNO: I'm okay. I just never lost anyone under my command before. 
PICARD: I'm afraid that never gets easier. 
WESLEY: Captain, Mom, will you excuse us please? Nick and I have some
things we need to talk about. 
CRUSHER: Of course. Let me know if you need anything. 
WESLEY: I will. 
PICARD: I'll see you at the inquiry. Good to meet you, Mister Locarno. 
LOCARNO: You too, sir. 
(Picard and Beverly leave) 
LOCARNO: The inquiry is scheduled for fifteen hundred hours. Are you
ready? 
WESLEY: I think so. 
LOCARNO: Don't worry about it, Wes. Everything's going to be all right
so long as we stick together.

[Academy gardens]

(Picard strolls across the Japanese bridge) 
BOOTHBY [OC]: Hey! Can't you see that's a flower bed? 
CADET [OC]: Sorry. I'm really sorry. 
(A cadet has been sitting under a tree. The old gardener goes to repair
the damage caused) 
PICARD: Boothby? Jean-Luc Picard, class of twenty seven. 
BOOTHBY: I know that. What happened to your hair? 
PICARD: How are you? 
BOOTHBY: I'm pretty damned cranky, thank you. I've already replanted
this bed four times this week. 
PICARD: Let me give you a hand. 
BOOTHBY: You? 
PICARD: I've acquired an interest over the years. 
BOOTHBY: Well, don't plant 'em too deep. The stems 
PICARD: Will rot. 
BOOTHBY: Captain Picard. Of the Enterprise, no less. And giving the
commencement address. 
PICARD: You sound surprised. 
BOOTHBY: Surprised? Uh, uh. Nothing you ever did surprised me, son.
Except that time you caught that Ligonian with a reverse body lift and
pinned him in the first fourteen seconds of the match. Didn't think you
had it in you. 
PICARD: Well, it was all in the legs, all that running I did. Boothby. 
BOOTHBY: Hmmm? 
PICARD: I don't think I ever. I don't think I ever told you how much I
appreciate. 
BOOTHBY: There's nothing to tell. 
(They go walking) 
PICARD: Yes, there is. I just wanted to, while I was here. Look, you
know as well as I do I would never have graduated if you 
BOOTHBY: You made a mistake. There isn't a man among us who hasn't been
young enough to make one. 
PICARD: Nevertheless. 
BOOTHBY: You did what you had to do. You did what you thought was best.
I just made sure that you listened to yourself. 
PICARD: At the time I thought you were a mean-spirited, vicious old
man. 
BOOTHBY: I was. And by the way, I was about the same age you are now. 
PICARD: I didn't speak to you for months. 
BOOTHBY: You needed to get your bearings. I knew that. The important
thing is, what you did with your life afterwards. Seems you did okay.
That's thanks enough for me. 
PICARD: Did you know the boy from Nova Squadron who was killed? 
BOOTHBY: Josh Albert? Yeah. Crusher, Hajar, Sito, Locarno. I know them
all.
