[Bridge]

PICARD: Thrilling. That was absolutely thrilling.
And I was right, Number One. There were ghosts aboard that old ship.
One of them actually spoke to us. 
RIKER: A friendly one, I hope? 
PICARD: My own counterpart. The captain's final message, praising his
crew. 
RIKER: I hope you'll be as thoughtful when the time comes. 
PICARD: Mister Data, advise the Astral Five annex. This should be
catalogued and scheduled for retrieval. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
(Troi and Riker have big grins on their faces) 
TROI: I'm sorry, Captain, it's just a rare pleasure to meet this side
of your personality. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher, set course for the original coordinates. 
WESLEY: Yes, sir. 
DATA: Captain, we are experiencing a two percent drop in energy
reserves. Compensating. 
RIKER: We were having a few problems while 
WORF: Readouts indicate we are being bombarded with a field of high
intensity radiation. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
DATA: Captain, energy loss increasing to five percent. 
PICARD: Yellow Alert. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Energy loss increasing, sir. 
PICARD: Mister Crusher. Reverse course. Full impulse power. 
WESLEY: No response, sir. 
PICARD: Increase speed to warp one. 
WESLEY: Engines are not responding, Captain. 
RIKER: Mister La Forge. 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: We need warp power now! 
LAFORGE: Matter-anti matter mixture ratio settings at optimum balance
Reaction sequence corresponding to specified norms. Magnetic plasma
transfer to warp field generators per programme specs. Commander, we
should be going like a bat out of hell.
