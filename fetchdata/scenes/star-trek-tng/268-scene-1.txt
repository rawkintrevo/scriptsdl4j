[Town square]

(early morning in the Renaissance) 
GARVIN: So when you return from school tonight, I'll be meeting with
the village elders. 
GIA: Again? 
GARVIN: Gia. 
GIA: I know, I know. You're the town magistrate and you have a lot of
work to do, but it always seems like you're always in some meeting or 
(enter Data, disheveled, carrying a box and making a strange noise) 
GARVIN: Gia, go home. Now. Who are you? What do you want? 
(Gia hides to watch) 
DATA: (trying to imitate the words) Who are you? What do you want? 
GARVIN: What's wrong with you? 
DATA: What's wrong with you? 
GARVIN: There's nothing wrong with me. Who are you? What is your name?
Can you understand me? My name is Garvin. 
DATA: My name is Garvin? 
(Gia giggles) 
GARVIN: I thought I told you to go home. 
GIA: I know. 
DATA: I do not know my name. 
GARVIN: What? 
DATA: You asked if I knew my name. I do not. 
GARVIN: Well at least you seem to be understanding a little more. 
DATA: Yes. It is becoming easier. 
GIA: Ask him where he's from, father. 
GARVIN: Gia, go on to school. I'll deal with the stranger. 
GIA: Yes, Father. Goodbye. 
DATA: Goodbye. 
GARVIN: Your eyes and skin look so strange. Your clothes, you look like
you've been in some kind of accident. 
DATA: I do not remember being in an accident. 
GARVIN: What do you remember? 
DATA: I walked here from the mountains. 
GARVIN: The mountains? The mountains are over two hundred seltons from
here. 
DATA: I have a clear memory of my journey. 
GARVIN: What do you remember before that? 
DATA: I have no prior memory. 
GARVIN: Do you know what that is? 
(referring to the box marked Radioactive that Data is carrying) 
DATA: No. 
GARVIN: May I? May I have it? 
DATA: Yes. 
GARVIN: There might be something in here that can tell us who you are. 
GARVIN: I wonder what these markings mean. 
DATA: Radioactive. 
GARVIN: What? 
DATA: That is what is written on the container. 
GARVIN: You can read this language? 
DATA: Evidently. 
GARVIN: Radioactive. What does that mean? 
DATA: I do not know. Perhaps it is my name. 
GARVIN: I've never heard a name like that. You must come from a very
distant place. 
(Garvin opens the box and takes out a piece of shiny metal)
