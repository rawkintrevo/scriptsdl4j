TROI ELI LAFORGE WORF PICARD COMPUTER ANNIE DATA ALEXANDER

[Engineering]

DATA: I am now attempting to access the long range
sensor array. 
LAFORGE: Forward sensor array coming online. We're getting a clear
scan. 
DATA: I will perform a routine maintenance check on the starboard
inertial damping system. 
LAFORGE: Dampers online. Maintenance check in progress. Data, I think
we're on to something here. Let's see what you can do with secondary
systems. Try gravitational control. 
DATA: Initiating gravitational 
(Data twitches) 
LAFORGE: What's wrong? 
DATA: There appears to be an energy fluctuation in my neural net. I am
disconnecting my interface to the computer. Interface deactivated. 
LAFORGE: You all right? 
DATA: I have experienced a brief power surge in my positronic
subprocessor. But I am fine. 
LAFORGE: (disconnecting Data) Maybe the interface coding isn't as
stable than we thought. Looks like we've got a couple of hours of
systems analysis before we can try this again. Let's check the
interface programming. 
(Data picks up a tricorder, flips it over, then pushes it down into his
'holster')

[Sheriff's office ]

(Eli is in the jail) 
WORF: What are his rights in this century? Is there be a trial or shall
I execute him? 
ALEXANDER: We're supposed to hold him until the US Marshal comes, and
then we'll take him to Rapid City for a trial. 
ELI: Frankly, I don't think I'll be around here that long. Not after my
old man hears about this. 
WORF: What old man are you referring to? 
ELI: My pa. When he breaks me out of this tin can, the gravedigger'll
be working overtime. 
ALEXANDER: Your pa's no match for Sheriff Worf. 
WORF: Yes. When your pa comes, we will be ready for him. 
TROI: (lighting a cigar) He's right. You're no match for the
Hollanders. 
WORF: I am sure the three of us can handle any problems. 
TROI: Hold on. I was just passing through town, saw a little trouble,
thought I'd lend a hand. But I ain't one of your deputies, Sheriff. 
WORF: Counsellor, I would appreciate some support in this matter. 
TROI: Durango. I'm called Durango. 
WORF: Yes, er, Counsellor Durango, perhaps you would consider becoming
a temporary deputy? 
TROI: For a price. Five hundred dollars. 
WORF: Alexander we require large amounts of currency. 
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir. I'll go to the bank and make a withdrawal. 
(Alexander leaves) 
WORF: Deanna, how do you know so much about this period in Earth's
history? 
TROI: My father used to read me stories from the Ancient West when I
was a little girl. I must admit, I always wanted to play the part of
the mysterious stranger. 
(the saloon owner, a buxom middle-aged woman, enters and kisses Worf) 
ANNIE: You are so brave, facing down that evil man like you did. 
WORF: Why hank you. Miss? 
ANNIE: Annie, you big galoot. You best not forget that tonight, 'cos
I'm going to make you beef steak and some gooseberry cobbler for
dessert. 
TROI: Sounds delicious. 
ANNIE: And I bought some special candles for the table setting. Pure
beeswax. 
WORF: I will not be able to come this evening. I have a prisoner. 
TROI: I'll watch him for you, Sheriff. You two go have a good time. 
WORF: That's very considerate of you, but I would be negligent in my
duties if I did not stay. I am sorry, Miss Annie. 
ANNIE: It's another woman, ain't it? It's that floozy down there at
Miss Langford's house of pleasure. 
WORF: Who? 
(Annie slaps Worf's face and leaves) 
ELI: You sure got a way with women, Sheriff.
