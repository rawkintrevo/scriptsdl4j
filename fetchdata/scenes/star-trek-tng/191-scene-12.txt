(doorbell) 
PICARD: Come. 
(doorbell) 
PICARD: Come. 
(doorbell, so he gets up. Doorbell again) 
PICARD: Yes, yes. 
(he gets to the door, it opens and there is no one there so he returns
to his desk, and the doorbell chimes again, and again, and again. Then
someone actually knocks at the door) 
PICARD: Come. 
(Beverly and Deanna enter) 
PICARD: What? 
CRUSHER: Captain, do you have a moment? 
TROI: We're concerned. We're afraid whatever happened on the Brittain
may be starting here. 
PICARD: Explain. 
TROI: Well, Beverly and I have been getting unusual reports. People
behaving strangely, others hearing sounds that aren't there. 
PICARD: Are we talking about hallucinations? 
CRUSHER: In some cases. In others just erratic behaviour. 
TROI: We can't track down any element that might be responsible. 
PICARD: But everything started when we found the Brittain? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Captain, we have to get the Enterprise away from here
before it gets any worse. 
PICARD: We're preparing to take the Brittain in tow. We'll be on our
way within the hour.

RIKER: Ensign Lin. 
DATA: Ready now, Captain. 
PICARD: Report to Sickbay, Ensign Rager. 
PICARD: Ready tractor beam, Mister Worf. 
DATA: Captain, thrusters are losing power. 
PICARD: Impulse engines. Ahead, minimum power. 
LIN: Impulse engines are not responding, sir. 
RIKER: Geordi, what's going on down there? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I don't know, sir. Nothing's responding. 
PICARD: Go to warp engines, factor one. Engage. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain

LAFORGE: We don't have warp drive either.
