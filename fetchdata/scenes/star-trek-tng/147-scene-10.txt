RIKER LAFORGE WORF

[Hathaway
Bridge]


(It
looks like it's been
partially stripped for spares. Everyone is using torches at
first)
LAFORGE:
There should be some emergency Bridge lighting here. 
(He finds it. We see the dust sheets and detail) 
WORF: Not good. 
RIKER: Ah, you're wrong, Mister Worf. It's fantastic. And it's ours.
(offers him the First Officer's seat) Mister Worf. 
WORF: Sir, Lieutenant La Forge is a superior officer. The honour should
be his. 
RIKER: Worf, this is a battle simulation. You're my Tactical Officer.
I've discussed this with Geordi and we agreed. You need to be at my
side. 
LAFORGE: Besides, Worf, if Engineering's anything like the Bridge, I'm
going to have my hands full. 
(Riker sits and activates ship wide broadcast. We here the Original
Series bosun whistle) 
RIKER: Attention, crew of the USS Hathaway. This is your Captain. Over
the next two days, you might lose a lot of sleep, but with your skill
and your stamina, we'll have this old lady ready to fly. I want hourly
progress reports from all stations. Riker out.
