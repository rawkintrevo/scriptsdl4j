TROI CREWMAN TASHA PICARD ARGYLE TRAVELLER RIKER WESLEY CRUSHER KOSINSKI

[Engineering]

PICARD: (to Kosinski) What did you do? 
RIKER: It wasn't him. It never was. It was his assistant. 
PICARD: What are you talking about? 
RIKER: Kosinski wasn't the one controlling the warp experiments. 
KOSINSKI: It was me! 
RIKER: The equations he punched in were nonsense, just as we thought. 
KOSINSKI: I honestly thought it was me. I thought somehow, somehow I
was operating on his level. 
ARGYLE: It's also my fault, Captain. I should have realised it wasn't
Kosinski. 
PICARD: How could you? How could any of us? 
RIKER: Wesley did. 
PICARD: If you knew something, why didn't you say so? 
RIKER: He tried, twice. I didn't listen. 
PICARD: He's unconscious. Why? 
CRUSHER: I'm not certain yet. 
WESLEY: He phased, sir. 
PICARD: What does that mean? 
WESLEY: Parts of him disappeared and then came back. Nobody else was
paying attention to him the first time.
RIKER: When we saw it this time, he seemed to be struggling, fighting
it. 
CRUSHER: He's dying. 
PICARD: He mustn't. He's the only one who can get us back. 
CRUSHER: Realistically, it does not seem possible.

Captain's log, supplemental. Our position is
unknown, and our only chance of returning to the known universe is a
dying alien who is generally humanoid but with a physiology
sufficiently different from our own to create medical problems in
caring for him.

[Sickbay]

(Crusher is tending the Traveller) 
PICARD: Cause? 
CRUSHER: I don't know. My equipment doesn't register his kind of life
signs. I would have to guess exhaustion, fatigue. 
WESLEY: Is he going to be all right? 
PICARD: What is the boy doing here? 
WESLEY: Mom, he's my friend. 
RIKER: You may want him here before we're done, sir. He seems to have
developed some sort of special attachment to the boy. 
WESLEY: My name is Wesley, Commander Riker. 
PICARD: He knows. We all know. Will he live? 
CRUSHER: I'm not sure. 
PICARD: Wake him. 
CRUSHER: I recommend we let him come around in his own time. 
PICARD: We don't have that luxury. Wake him. 
CRUSHER: He could die, and with him any chance we have. 
PICARD: Doctor. Wes. We all have other friends aboard this ship, too.
If we stay here much longer we may lose the ability to distinguish
between thought and reality. Now, regardless of the risk, wake him.
Now. 
(Crusher gives the Traveller an injection) 
PICARD: Do you recognise me? I'm the Captain and I need answers. 
TRAVELLER: I'll do my best to provide 
PICARD: Who are you? Or what? 
TRAVELLER: I am a Traveller. 
PICARD: Traveller? What is your destination? 
TRAVELLER: Destination? 
PICARD: Yes, what place are you trying to reach? 
TRAVELLER: Ah, place. No. There is no specific place I wish to go. 
PICARD: Then what is the purpose of your journey? 
TRAVELLER: Curiosity. 
PICARD: That's not an answer. 
TRAVELLER: I have certain abilities. They give me an understanding of
propulsion. I've been trading this for passage on Starfleet vessels. 
RIKER: And allowing Kosinski to take credit for what you did. 
TRAVELLER: It seemed the sensible way. 
PICARD: Until now. 
TRAVELLER: Captain, I seek only transportation in order to see and
experience your reality. I am no a threat to you, your ship or your
crew. 
WESLEY: He isn't, Captain. I know he isn't. 
PICARD: Our reality? And in order to satisfy this curiosity, you have
brought my ship and my crew into great risk. 
TRAVELLER: I have made some mistakes. 
PICARD: Some mistakes? What mistakes could possibly explain these
incredible explosions of velocity? 
TRAVELLER: I don't know if I can put this in terms you'll understand. 
PICARD: I believe there may be a warp speed that can get us beyond
Galaxy M Thirty Three, but there is no velocity of any magnitude that
can possibly bring us wherever this is. Is it true what our navigation
sensors are telling us? Are we millions of light years away from where
we were? 
TRAVELLER: Well, yes. 
PICARD: Well, what got us here? 
TRAVELLER: Thought. 
PICARD: Thought? 
TRAVELLER: You do understand, don't you that thought is the basis of
all reality? The energy of thought, to put it in your terms, is very
powerful. 
KOSINSKI: That's not an explanation. 
TRAVELLER: I have the ability to act like a lens which focuses thought.

KOSINSKI: That's just so much nonsense. You're asking us to believe in
magic. 
TRAVELLER: Well yes, this could seem like magic to you. 
PICARD: No. No, it actually makes sense to me. Only the power of
thought could explain what has been happening. Especially out here. 
TRAVELLER: Thought is the essence of where you are now. You do
understand the danger, don't you? 
PICARD: Chaos. What we think is what happens. 
TRAVELLER: It pains me I was so careless, Captain. My intent was only
to observe, not to cause this. You should not be here until your far,
far distant future. Certainly not until you have learned control. 
RIKER: You are from a different time, aren't you? 
TRAVELLER: Well, no, not exactly from another time. Although as you
understand the concept, yes, perhaps that term fits as well as any. 
RIKER: And you have this ability to travel. 
TRAVELLER: Yes. 
RIKER: And others of your kind have the same ability? 
TRAVELLER: Yes. 
RIKER: Then why, in all of our history, is there no record of you or
someone like you ever having visited us? 
TRAVELLER: What wonderful arrogance. There is no record because we have
not visited you before. 
RIKER: Why not? 
TRAVELLER: Well, up until now, if you'll forgive this, you've been
uninteresting. It's only now that your life form merits serious
attention. I'm sorry. 
PICARD: What's happening? 
CRUSHER: He's unconscious again. 
PICARD: Revive him. 
CRUSHER: Whatever you need from him, you'd better get it soon. 
RIKER: If I may suggest, sir, that first leap out of our galaxy was, as
he said, a mistake. 
PICARD: Unless he was distracted by something. 
RIKER: And it weakened him, in some way leading to the incredible leap
out here. 
KOSINSKI: Theory! 
PICARD: Do you have any facts that fit this? Can you get us back? 
KOSINSKI: Wait, Captain, not so fast. We have an opportunity here for
scientific discovery. 
PICARD: And we report our observations how? To whom? (to the Traveller)
Can you get us back? 
TRAVELLER: I will try. 
PICARD: Number One, take him down to main Engineering. I'll be on the
Bridge. 
WESLEY: No! He's very weak. TRAVELLER: The Captain's right. We must
hurry. But first, I request a moment with the Captain. Alone. 
(Riker, Kosinski, Crusher and Wesley leave) 
PICARD: Strange how he seems to care for you. 
TRAVELLER: He will forget me in time, which is as it should be. It's
Wesley I wanted to speak to you about. 
PICARD: The boy? 
TRAVELLER: It's best you do not repeat this to the others, especially
not to the mother. Whatever may happen, it is imperative that it
proceed naturally. 
PICARD: I must get my ship back. Do we have time for this? 
TRAVELLER: Oh, yes. He and a few like him are why I travel. You have it
in your power to encourage him without interfering. 
PICARD: Encourage him in what? 
TRAVELLER: How shall I explain? Are you familiar with the intricacies
of what is called here music? 
PICARD: Somewhat. 
TRAVELLER: Such musical genius I saw in one of your ship's libraries.
One called Mozart, who as a small child wrote astonishing symphonies. A
genius who made music not only to be heard, but seen and felt beyond
the understanding, the ability of others. Wesley is such a person. Not
with music, but with the equally lovely intricacies of time, energy,
propulsion. and the instruments of this vessel which allow all that to
be played. You're right, I must hurry now. But you're right in
something else. He is just a boy for now. He should be encouraged, but
told none of this. 

[Corridor]

(Riker is waiting) 
PICARD: We're going to get back home. Take him to Engineering. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: I'll be on the Bridge. 
RIKER: Yes, sir. 
(A little way along, a crewman is trapped by flames) 
PICARD: Put it out! 
CREWMAN: How? 
PICARD: Think! Put the flame out in your thoughts. 
(He eventually does so) 
PICARD: Now, Get to your station and concentrate on your assignment. 
CREWMAN: Yes, sir.

Captain's log. Any time entry is meaningless. We
have no choice but to repeat the same warp experiment. but wish one
variation. A principal part of this warp formula will be the thoughts
of everyone aboard the Enterprise. We have no idea exactly how this
works. We understand only that the Traveller makes use of this somehow.
It will be most important that those aboard avoid random thoughts that
might change
the reality of what we're attempting to do.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do you have any further advice, Counsellor?

TROI: When you begin the attempt, there will be stress, and it's only
natural the crew's concentration will shift.
TASHA: Plus some genuine fear, Captain. You can't notice what's
happening outside without feeling some of that.
PICARD: All decks, all stations. 
[Various parts of the ship]

PICARD [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. All
decks, I must have your full attention. In a few moments, as we attempt
to warp back home, it is vital, absolutely vital, that you centre your
thoughts on your duty or on the welfare of the one called the
Traveller. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: Think of giving him some of your
strength. Now, this is an order. You must try to do this. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: And now, attempt to concentrate completely
on your duty of the moment. Or on the Traveller, on his
well being.
