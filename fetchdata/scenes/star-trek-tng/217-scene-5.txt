[Shuttlecraft]

SOREN: I've illuminated the delta four grid map.
We'll start there and expand. 
RIKER: Stand by, forward phaser array. 
SOREN: Pulse vanished at delta four point two by point three. 
RIKER: Firing second burst. 
SOREN: Delta four point four by point five. 
RIKER: This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. 
SOREN: Commander, tell me about your sexual organs. 
RIKER: Er. 
SOREN: Is that an uncomfortable subject for humans? 
RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. 
SOREN: I'm interested in your mating practices. What is involved with
two sexes? 
RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. 
SOREN: Mating? 
RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Women
carry the baby. 
SOREN: Our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks, which the parents
inseminate. From what we know of other species, our method is less
risky and less painful. 
RIKER: And less enjoyable. 
SOREN: Less enjoyable? 
RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It
can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. 
SOREN: That's just the last step. Mating is a long ritual for us, full
of variety and invention. I assure you, it is extremely pleasurable. 
RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. 
SOREN: That may be coming from our shuttle. I'll note these
coordinates. 
SOREN: I wonder. 
RIKER: What? 
SOREN: If a human and a J'naii would be sexually compatible. 
RIKER: I don't know. 
SOREN: Of course it would never be permitted. 
RIKER: Why not? 
SOREN: The idea of gender. It is offensive to my people. You see, long
ago we had two sexes, as you do. But we evolved into a higher form. I
don't mean to sound insulting, but on my planet we have been taught
that gender is primitive. 
RIKER: Primitive? 
SOREN: Less evolved. 
RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for an
experience that's primitive. 
SOREN: Delta five grid map is fully plotted. 
RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. 
(the shuttle's port nacelle workings are exposed) 
RIKER: The port engine's down. 
SOREN: Reducing power in the starboard nacelle. 
RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters.

SOREN: Thrusters aren't responding. I'll try to reroute the firing
sequence. 
RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! 
(Soren gets thrown across the floor) 
LAFORGE [OC]: Enterprise to shuttle, do you read me? 
RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. 
LAFORGE [OC]: We'll try to get a tractor beam on you. 
RIKER: The sooner the better. Enterprise, we have an injury. Transport
Soren directly to Sickbay. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Right away, Commander.
