having perform away doorbell waking sensors come arm recognition

[Cargo bay]

ENGINEER: Is there something wrong, sir?

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: And there's no evidence of an EPS
explosion. 
RIKER: Sensors seemed to think there was. 
LAFORGE: I think my modification to the sensor array may have caused a
pattern recognition failure. 
RIKER: Just a sensor glitch? 
LAFORGE: That's my guess. 
RIKER: Let's perform a level three diagnostic on the internal sensor
network and make sure that we haven't overlooked anything. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Could we pick this up in the morning, Geordi? Get a fresh start?
Would you do me a favour? Stop by my quarters, oh seven hundred hours.
I'm having trouble waking up. 
LAFORGE: Sure, Commander. Goodnight. 
RIKER: Goodnight.

down)

CREWMAN: Commander. 
LAFORGE: Gordon. 
(Geordi rings a doorbell)

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Who is it? 
LAFORGE [OC]: It's La Forge. 
RIKER: Come in. LAFORGE: Good morning. 
RIKER: Morning? I just went to bed. 
LAFORGE: Commander, it's oh seven hundred hours.

MOT: She said, if they're not squirming, we won't
eat 'em! 
(Worf enters) 
MOT: Ah, Mister Worf, my good Klingon. Sir, welcome. What a pleasure it
is to have you with us again so soon. So, Lieutenant, haircut today?
Trim your beard? 
WORF: I would like my hair trimmed. 
MOT: Ah. A trim, of course. 
WORF: Not like last time. 
MOT: Oh no, just a little off the top. I took way too much off last
time. I was just telling my colleague, Mister Setti, how thick and
luxuriant Klingon hair is. It's such a pleasure to cut. Sometimes I get
carried away. All those away missions, the wind and dry air, the
elements really are harsh on the hair. I'd like to suggest that you
start using a conditioning agent. 
(Worf sees the scissors and grabs Mot's arm) 
MOT: I promise, not too much off the top. 
(Worf leaves)
