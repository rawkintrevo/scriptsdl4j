TROI WORD PICARD CLERK RIKER MICKEYD BELLBOY

[Lobby]

RIKER: What did you find? 
WORD: Nothing. 
CLERK: Rita just called. 
BELLBOY: She did? What did she say? 
CLERK: It was kind of hard to tell. She was crying. 
BELLBOY: Crying? Damn. Mickey D thinks he can treat people any way he
wants. Well, that's all over now. 
(Enter Mickey D through the main door, white suit with overcoat draped
across his shoulders) 
MICKEY D: You were told. 
BELLBOY: It's not for you to make the call. It's for Rita. 
MICKEY D: She sent me to tell you. 
CLERK: Okay, boys. Look, we can't afford to have any trouble in here.
Why don't you just take this outside. 
MICKEY D: Yeah, I like that. Come on, baggage man. 
[Ready room]

(Troi and Picard are listening on the open comm.
channel) 
MICKEY D [OC]: Let's you and me take it outside. 
BELLBOY [OC]: When I was a kid, I used to look up to you guys. The
suit, the fancy shoes. I really thought that made you somebody, but
you're nobody. She could make something out of her life 
(Picard mutes it) 
TROI: I don't believe this dialogue. Did humans really talk like that? 
PICARD: Not in real life. Remember, everything that's going on down
there is taken from what Colonel Richey calls a second-rate novel. 
BELLBOY [OC]: Like Rita. She could do something with her life. She
could be somebody if she only had the chance. 
TROI: With your permission, sir. 
(Troi leaves) 
MICKEY D [OC]: She is somebody. She's my girl. 
BELLBOY [OC]: You got her on the stuff. That's the only reason she
stays with you. Because you feed her sickness. 
[Lobby]

BELLBOY: You got to let me help her. 
MICKEY D: Well why don't we just go outside and talk about it? 
CLERK: Just watch yourself. 
BELLBOY: Don't worry. 
RIKER: It's all part of the novel. Don't interfere. 
(Mickey D shoots the bellboy in the back as he walks to the door. The
customers scream) 
MICKEY D: You should have listened to me, kid. No woman's worth dying
for. Killing for, not dying for. 
(Mickey D leaves) 
RIKER: Riker to Enterprise. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: Yes, Number One. 
RIKER [OC]: A bizarre incident just took place. 
PICARD: The shoot-out between the bellboy and Mickey D. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: Yes, and Mickey D just walked out the door.
How did he do that? 
[Ready room]

PICARD: It's on page 244. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: In the novel. Right. How does it end? 
[Ready room]

PICARD: A bad love affair ends in a bloody
shoot-out, the hotel gets bought out, and life goes on, such as it is. 
[Lobby]

RIKER: The hotel gets bought? By whom?
