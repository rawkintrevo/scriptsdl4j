[Data's quarters]

PICARD: I'm not going to hurt you. 
DATA-VICTIM: Only Masaka can hurt me. I am for her alone. 
PICARD: I need to speak with Ihat. Do you understand? Ihat. 
DATA-IHAT: Captain. That was a cruel joke you played on me. For a
moment, a brief moment, I actually thought that woman was Masaka. 
PICARD: Whoever took your place wasn't afraid of Masaka. He seemed
eager for his fate. 
DATA-IHAT: Pitiful, isn't it. You won't catch me humiliating myself for
a woman even if she were a queen. 
PICARD: Then Masaka is your queen? 
DATA-IHAT: She's a lazy creature. She spends most of her time sleeping.
The problem is, what she does when she's awake. 
PICARD: Then should we try to keep her asleep? 
DATA-IHAT: Try to stop the sun from climbing the sky? Only Korgano can
do that, and he's not here. 
PICARD: Where is he? 
DATA-BOY: Help me. Please. 
PICARD: What's wrong? 
DATA-BOY: I'm afraid. 
PICARD: Of what? 
DATA-BOY: Of her. 
PICARD: Masaka? 
DATA-BOY: Her! 
(the lights go out) 
PICARD: Picard to Bridge.

PICARD [OC]: Report. 
RIKER: The archive just activated some kind of tractor beam, sir. We're
not able to disengage it.
