WORF: Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now five light
years away. 
RIKER: Are we still picking up the Entity's pattern? 
DATA: Yes, Commander, but sensors have not yet locked onto its exact
whereabouts. 
MARR: Captain, we are reasonably sure it's between here and the
Brechtian Cluster. If I start emitting the graviton beam now, it may
serve as a lure. A kind of beacon. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
MARR: We'll start with a pulse width of five nanoseconds, frequency one
pulse per second. 
DATA: Commencing graviton emissions now. 
(and out goes the sonar beep) 
LAFORGE: No change in the sensor readings. 
MARR: Let's ramp frequency. 
DATA: Emissions now at ten pulses per second. 
WORF: Sir. 
MARR: What is it? Do you have something? 
WORF: A large mass approaching at warp speed. 
PICARD: Full stop. 
HELM: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Doctor, continue emitting the signals. Mister Worf, on screen. 
RIKER: Shields up. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
MARR: It's beautiful. 
RIKER: What's it doing? Checking us out? 
PICARD: Possibly. Just as we're checking it out. 
DATA: Doctor Marr, do you wish to change the frequency? Doctor Marr? 
MARR: Yes. Yes, proceed, Commander. 
DATA: Changing to twenty pulses per second. 
(the Entity changes its direction of rotation) 
TROI: Is it responding to us? 
MARR: Let's test that. Ramp the frequency again, Commander. 
DATA: Emissions now at thirty pulses per second. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm reading a transmission from the Entity. A series
of graviton pulses. 
MARR: It's working. That's a response to our signal. 
PICARD: Remarkable. 
DATA: Captain, there is a pattern emerging from the signals. 
PICARD: It's trying to communicate with us. 
DATA: I believe so, sir, but it will take some time to decipher the
patterns. 
PICARD: Then it's possible. Communication, understanding. 
MARR: Let me try something else. A continuous graviton beam. 
LAFORGE: All graviton pulses from the Entity have stopped. 
TROI: Maybe it doesn't like what we're doing. 
PICARD: Doctor, return to the intermittent signal. 
(the Entity begins to shake) 
DATA: Doctor? Doctor Marr? Doctor Marr, we must return to the
intermittent signal. 
PICARD: Counsellor? 
TROI: Something's very wrong, Captain. 
DATA: Sir, the Entity is beginning to resonate. Vibrations are
increasing. 
PICARD: Doctor, stop the transmission. That is an order. Doctor Marr,
do you hear me? 
MARR: It's for you, Renny I did it for you. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, take charge of the Doctor. Mister Data, shut down
the transmission. 
LAFORGE: Vibration amplitude is increasing. It can't last much longer. 
DATA: I cannot stop our graviton signal, Captain. Doctor Marr has
isolated the access code. 
LAFORGE: Maybe I can create an override sequence. Shut it down from
here. 
DATA: The amplitude is still rising, Captain. Resonance is approaching
critical. 
LAFORGE: I can override her programme, but it's going to take some
time. 
(and the Entity shatters into a billion tiny shards) 
PICARD: Mister Worf, will you escort the Doctor to her quarters. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
MARR: It will never hurt anyone again. 
DATA: Perhaps I should escort the Doctor, sir. 
PICARD: Fine, but don't leave her unattended. 
DATA: Please come with me, Doctor. 
MARR: Of course.
