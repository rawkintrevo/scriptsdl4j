[Someone's quarters]

RIKER: Sometimes I wonder if he's stacking the
deck. 
DATA: I assure you, Commander, the cards are sufficiently randomised. 
WORF: I hope so. 
RIKER: Something wrong, Mister Worf? 
WORF: I am experiencing nIb'poH. The feeling I have done this before. 
RIKER: Yeah, last Tuesday night. 
WORF: That is not what I mean. 
CRUSHER: I've been having the same feeling. Wait. An eight, an Ace, a
Queen and a four. Deal the cards, Data. 
(Data deals everyone a three) 
DATA: Three. All threes. 
CRUSHER: I was positive I knew what cards were going to be dealt. 
WORF: I was also sure. 
RIKER: Finish dealing the hand. 
(Riker gets all eights, Worf all Kings, Crusher all tens and Data all
sixes) 
RIKER: Look at this, we've all got three of a kind. 
CRUSHER: First we get a three, and then three of a kind. 
OGAWA [OC]: Ogawa to Doctor Crusher.

OGAWA [OC]: Commander La Forge needs you in Sickbay. 
CRUSHER: I'm on my way.
