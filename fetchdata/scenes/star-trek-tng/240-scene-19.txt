PICARD: Where is it now, Mister Data? 
DATA: It has disappeared once again, sir. I believe it may have been
coming to a halt. 
PICARD: Stop engines. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: If this is a Romulan ship, will it stay in position until we
leave? 
DESEVE: I don't think so, sir. A Romulan Commander's instinct would be
to attack.

TORETH: Engage manoeuvring engines, forward zero
point one. Take us directly under their hull. 
PILOT: Yes, Commander. 
TROI: What are you doing? 
TORETH: It seems that the Enterprise can track us even though we are
cloaked. I intend to find out whether they can or cannot. N'Vek, ready
attack procedure. 
N'VEK: Sir, disruptors are standing by. Ready to disengage cloak. 
TROI: We cannot risk an engagement here. 
TORETH: Considering the nature of our mission, I would have preferred
to have avoided it as well. But I see no other alternative. 
TROI: What do you intend to do? 
TORETH: We will pass as close as we possibly can. If they do have the
ability to track us, they will move to avoid a collision. If they do, I
will destroy them.

DATA: Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared. 
PICARD: Bearing and speed? 
DATA: It appears to be moving toward us, closing slowly. Its bearing
indicates a possible collision course. 
RIKER: Time to impact? 
DATA: I am unable to make a precise measurement. However I would
estimate impact within ninety seconds. 
RIKER: It doesn't make any sense. Why would they run into us? And if
they were, why wouldn't they do it at full speed? 
DESEVE: I don't know, sir. The Romulans will sometimes make suicide
attacks, but only as a last resort. There's no reason for it here. 
DATA: Time to impact approximately sixty seconds. 
PICARD: We don't have the luxury to speculate. Back us away from the
distortion, Ensign. One half impulse. 
MCKNIGHT: Aye, sir.
