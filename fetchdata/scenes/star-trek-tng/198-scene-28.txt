(Geordi enters and watches Picard with the
Klingons) 
PICARD: All our transporter containers have a slight impurity in the
structural alloys which allows us to trace our material. 
(Geordi reaches for his phaser) 
O'BRIEN: Commander La Forge? 
LAFORGE: What can I do for you, Chief? 
O'BRIEN: Could you take a look at the pattern buffers? Considering
what's happened, I'm not sure the control systems are reliable. 
LAFORGE: Sure. Sure, let's take a look.
