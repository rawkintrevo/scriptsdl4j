[Hill's Office]

CRUSHER: It's no use. It's just not there. 
PICARD: Suggestions, Mister Data? 
DATA: I am at a loss, sir. We are in a holodeck-created building of
1941. The computer refuses to accept voice commands. The controls for
the environment are, therefore, not accessible. 
CRUSHER: I could use some light. 
(Data carries a standard lamp over, and is baffled when it goes out
because the plug has come out of the wall. Picard plugs it in nearer
the patient) 
(Leech returns with a gunman and a fat man) 
REDBLOCK: Good day, Mister Hill. My name is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you
don't mind us dropping in. 
(A very poor, skinny version of Sydney Greenstreet) 
PICARD: I see I have no choice. 
REDBLOCK: Life is an endless stream of choices. Unfortunately, you have
chosen to make my life more difficult. I don't suppose you'd be foolish
enough to hide it here. 
PICARD: I don't suppose so. 
REDBLOCK: Still, I'm sure you won't mind if we take a look around. 
CRUSHER: I wish you'd quit asking, since it's obvious you're going to
do it anyway. It's just a waste of time. 
REDBLOCK: Good manners, Madam, are never a waste of time. Civility,
gentlemen, always civility. Get that stiff out of here. 
CRUSHER: He's not dead. 
REDBLOCK: From his pallor, he soon will be. 
THUG: You want I should throw him in the garbage, boss? 
REDBLOCK: The room next door will be good enough for now. 
PICARD: Don't touch him. 
REDBLOCK: Which one struck you? 
LEECH: It was Hill. 
(Leech pistol-whips Picard) 
REDBLOCK: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. A
Newtonian truism which you have obviously neglected. 
MCNARY [OC]: Dix, you in there? 
(The Thug greets the policeman and takes the bottle of drink away from
him, then his gun) 
MCNARY: I saw your light, figured you were working late. Guess I was
right. Nice company you're keeping, Dix. You forget to take the trash
out this morning? 
(That earns him a punch in the solar plexus) 
REDBLOCK: I'm a tolerant man, but I do not tolerate disrespect. 
DATA: Your devotion to etiquette is highly admirable, sir. However,
your methods leave much to be desired. 
REDBLOCK: What have we here? 
LEECH: Looks like a ghost. 
REDBLOCK: Yeah. Where do you suppose he's from? 
LEECH: Where were you hatched, anyway? 
DATA: I was created on a planet 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: South America. 
REDBLOCK: I've been all over this world and I've never seen anything
like you. 
PICARD: He's not from this world. None of us are. We are from a world,
we're from a world of fabulous riches. A world where there are objects
far greater than the one you seek. 
LEECH: That's ridiculous! You're a private dick. We've met before and
you never even mentioned any of this. 
MCNARY: He's right, Dix. That's pretty weak stuff. I wouldn't even buy
that line of guff. 
PICARD: I am not Dixon Hill. I just look like Dixon Hill. 
DATA: He speaks the truth, sir. From your point of view, he is only a
facsimile, a knock-off, a cheap imitation. 
PICARD: Thank you, Mister Data. 
DATA: Sorry sir, that did not come out quite the way I intended. 
REDBLOCK: Very, very, good. What wonderful fiction. Quite entertaining.
I admire your skill at trying to obfuscate our sense of reality. 
DATA: It is you who are not real, sir. 
PICARD: Data. 
DATA: It is you who are imaginary characters derived from a work of
fiction. 
MCNARY: Give it up, fellas. These guys are too smart to fall for that
story. 
DATA: I am afraid you are not real either, Lieutenant. 
LEECH: I don't want to hear any more of this. You're making me crazy.
Let me shoot them, Mister Redblock. Let me kill them, one by one. 
REDBLOCK: What an interesting situation. Perhaps we should test this
theory by killing one of them. 
CRUSHER: You've already done that. This man is dying. This whole thing
is senseless. 
REDBLOCK: Hardly. Senseless killing is immoral. But killing for a
purpose can be quite often ingenious. 
LEECH: Well said, Mister Redblock. What is our purpose? 
REDBLOCK: We are on a quest for knowledge, Mister Leech. We want the
item. 
PICARD: We don't have it. 
LEECH: Shall I kill him? 
REDBLOCK: No, kill the woman. 
PICARD: Redblock. I have the item. 
REDBLOCK: At last. I knew it. God, man, you are a character you are.
Waiting until the last moment, testing my resolve. All right, where is
it? 
PICARD: I'll explain. But first, tell Leech to back off. 
REDBLOCK: Put the gun down, Mister Leech. 
LEECH: But I so much want to kill her. 
REDBLOCK: Maybe later. It won't harm us to listen to Mister Hill. 
MCNARY: Don't make any deals with that slime, Dix! 
(The Thug knocks him down again) 
REDBLOCK: All right, let's begin. Make your thoughts fruitful and your
words eloquent. Because I don't have to tell you your lovely lady
friend's life depends upon it. 
PICARD: There is a price. 
REDBLOCK: By God, I knew you were a man of stripe. All right, what is
it? 
PICARD: Mister Whalen's life. You must help us to save him.

[Bridge]

TROI: We can't delay much longer. 
RIKER: We're going to have to tell them something. Open hailing
frequencies. 
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. 
RIKER: This is Commander Riker, aboard the Enterprise. We demand that
you (ear splitting noise) Cut that off! They're not going to be
satisfied with anyone less than the Captain. 
[Outside Holodeck]

LAFORGE: La Forge to Bridge. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker here. 
LAFORGE: We think we have something, sir. I'll let Ensign Crusher
explain. 
WESLEY: The bi-converter interface has been affected 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Forget the explanation! Can you do it?

[Outside Holodeck]

WESLEY: I don't know if I should. If this isn't
done correctly, the programme could abort and everyone inside could
vanish.
