ACCOLAN: Have the lesions gone? 
LEDA: Yes. The medicine worked again. 
ACCOLAN: Good. Come see what Harry's doing. Beautiful! 
(Harry is polishing a sculpture) 
HARRY: Yeah, it really turned out well. 
ACCOLAN: It is so alive and graceful. What do you call it? 
HARRY: It's a dolphin. 
LEDA: Dolphin? 
HARRY: You know, it swims in the ocean. Like a fish, only it's not a
fish. 
LEDA: Ah. A fish. We used to have them in our oceans. I've never seen
one before. 
HARRY: I used to live near the ocean on Zadar Four. My dad's an
oceanographer. He says that. Never mind. It doesn't matter.

DUANA: You haven't eaten. 
WESLEY: You didn't eat anything. 
RADUE: We need very little. 
DUANA: I know you miss your family. But you will grow accustomed to us.
I promise you'll be happy. 
WESLEY: We were happy before we came. 
DUANA: We are offering more, especially for you. 
WESLEY: Duana, I feel badly for you that you have no children, but I
have to tell you that we don't want to be here and we will not
cooperate.
