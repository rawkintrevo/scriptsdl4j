NIKOLAI WORF

[Holodeck Cavern]

WORF: What are you doing here? 
NIKOLAI: I have to show you something. Whatever you do, stay quiet. 
(Nikolai taps on a PADD and a 'window opens in the holodeck rock face) 
NIKOLAI: Look. 
(it's the cavern on the planet) 
NIKOLAI: I've done what you refused to do. I've saved them.

[Corridor]

NIKOLAI: I started thinking about this days ago
when it became clear the planet was doomed. I knew if I could get
access to your ship's computer, I could generate a replica of the
caves. The hard part was transporting the Boraalans into the holodeck
without anybody on the Enterprise noticing. But I was able to blank out
the sensors and make it look like interference from the plasmonic
bursts. And it worked, perfectly. The Boraalans were transported while
they were sleeping. They never knew anything had happened.

WORF: Bridge. 
NIKOLAI: It's a simple plan, really. That's the beauty of it. Worf,
trust me. This is going to work. 
WORF: Trust you? You never had any intention of obeying the Captain. 
NIKOLAI: I wasn't going to let those people die just because your
Captain started quoting Federation dogma to me. 
WORF: Your duty was to respect the Captain's orders and to uphold the
Prime Directive. 
NIKOLAI: Duty. That's all that really matters to you, isn't it? Well, I
refuse to be bound by an abstraction. The lives of the people of Boraal
are far more important to me. You worry too much, Worf. You always did.
Everything will work out. 
WORF: You have disgraced yourself and you have disgraced me. I want
nothing more to do with you.
