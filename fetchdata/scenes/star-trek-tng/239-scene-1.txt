scheduled chew talked relay house long quarters start sent

[Aquiel's quarters]

(the monitor screen is all static) 
LAFORGE: What's going on here? Well, we can start with repolarising the
interface. 
(woof! The dog is on a bed. There is a display stand with a few items
on it) 
LAFORGE: What is it, pup? What's the matter? Something over here? (a
curved gold thing with blue stones) This doesn't look like it belongs
to you. Ah, This what you want, huh? (a bone-shaped chew) There you go.
Computer, run station logs in sequence. 
AQUIEL [OC]: Station log, stardate 46458.3. Today we configured the
relay controller grid. It was the last primary system we had to
overhaul. We are scheduled to recalibrate and align the antennae
systems in the next three days. 
LAFORGE: Computer, access visual output. 
AQUIEL [OC]: Sent in my third request for a message delay buffer. Until
it arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I have rigged a memory module to
compensate. It better work, or about a half million subspace messages
are going to end up drifting through space. Computer, open Uhnari
correspondence file. 
LAFORGE: Computer, access correspondence files, Lieutenant Aquiel
Uhnari. 
AQUIEL [OC]: Hello, Shiana. Sorry I haven't talked to you in a while
but I've been dealing with the new Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's been
rude, arrogant and condescending, and he's only been here two days.
This might be a long year. 
LAFORGE: Come on, Lieutenant. Stick with me. 
AQUIEL [OC]: I had the dream again. Mother's calling out my name. She's
somewhere in the house. I get to the top of the hill all right, but
then the house is slanted. I'm still walking uphill. I can't find her.
Doors everywhere and they all look the same.
