[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Damn! 
DATA: Try a bypass on the shield control interface. 
LAFORGE: No go. Let me see if I can directly access the master
programme. 
(Electricity leaps into Geordi when he touches the panel. Data throws
him clear - across the room) 
LAFORGE: Data? 
DATA: Yes? 
LAFORGE: What happened? 
DATA: Any answer would be mere speculation. This is yet another example
of how our actions have random results. 
LAFORGE: Thanks, Data. I noticed.

[Ready room]

RIKER: Life support has failed on decks seven and
thirteen, sir. Now what if this thing manages to rewrite our entire
system? It's so far beyond us that we don't have a hope of
understanding it, let alone controlling it. Our own ignorance could
kill us. 
PICARD: We may never reach that point. A variation of what happened to
the Yamato might destroy us first. 
RIKER: So we just sit here and watch our ship disintegrate around us? 
PICARD: The probe was launched from Iconia, probably from an automated
system. There may be records near the launch site that could help us
find a solution. 
RIKER: I'll arrange an away team. 
PICARD: And I'll lead it. 
RIKER: You will lead it? 
PICARD: Yes. 
RIKER: Sir, we've had this conversation a hundred times. 
PICARD: And we will have it again, Number One. I have been studying the
Iconians since I was a cadet. I have to be the one to go. The
Enterprise is yours. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: For as long as she lasts. 
[Transporter room]

(Guy Vardeman is fiddling with a panel in the
background when Picard, Data and Worf enter) 
O'BRIEN: I've got a fix on the energy source, and for the moment this
baby's working, but that could change in an instant. 
PICARD: We're aware of the risks. Energise.
O'BRIEN: Transport complete. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want to be
able to pull them out of there at a moment's notice. 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
WESLEY: Commander, Romulan vessel. 
(The big green ship decloaks in front of them) 
RIKER: Open hailing frequencies. 
WILLIAMS: (the lady who has replaced Worf) They're arming photon
torpedoes. 
RIKER: Shields up! Go to Red Alert. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields aren't responding. 
WILLIAMS: They are preparing to fire photon torpedoes. 
RIKER: Mister Crusher, I need those shields! 
WESLEY: I'm trying, sir! 
WILLIAMS: They're firing. 
(No, they're not) 
RIKER: What happened? 
WILLIAMS: Instead of firing they suddenly disarmed and cancelled. 
RIKER: Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.
Lock phasers on the Romulans and hold your fire. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields are back up. 
RIKER: Impeccable timing. 
WESLEY: Sir, the shields are back down. 
WILLIAMS: Phaser banks are down. 
WESLEY: Shields are back up. 
TROI: In another time and place this could be funny. 
RIKER: Status of torpedo banks? 
WILLIAMS: They're down, too. 
RIKER: In case it should become necessary to fight, could you arrange
to find me some rocks to throw at them? 
WILLIAMS: Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are continuing to arm and disarm. 
RIKER: Maybe its attempt to fire was unintentional. Open hailing
frequencies. 
WILLIAMS: Open. 
RIKER: Romulan vessel, this is Commander William Riker, First Officer
of the USS Enterprise. Why did you attempt to fire on us? 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: This is Sub-Commander Taris of the Haakona. Why
have you penetrated deeper into the Neutral Zone? 
RIKER: Why are you still here? 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: I have claimed this planet for the Romulan
Empire. 
RIKER: This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody can claim anything. 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: You will withdraw or I will be forced to destroy
your ship and your away team. 
(Transmission ends, the Romulan ship starts to cloak then decloaks
again) 
RIKER: What the hell? 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: (through static) This is your final warning, I
will not 
(The picture clears up, but something else is going on off screen) 
RIKER: Having a little trouble with your systems, Commander? Maybe we
could consider postponing the war until we solve our more immediate
problem? 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: You're stalling for time. 
WESLEY: Sir, another probe launched from the planet, heading toward the
Romulans. 
RIKER: Have we got our phasers back? 
WILLIAMS: No, sir. 
RIKER: Taris, if you've got phaser capability, prepare use them now! 
TARIS [on viewscreen]: What? 
RIKER: Destroy that probe! 
(Transmission ends, the probe gets blown up) 
RIKER: And not even a thank you. 
TROI: Sub-Commander Taris is deeply frustrated, probably because her
ship is as crippled as the Enterprise. 
WESLEY: Why would the Romulans be experiencing problems? They weren't
probed. 
RIKER: They must have tapped into the Yamato log. Taris got a whole lot
more than she bargained for. Maintain Red Alert. Try to keep those
shields up in case Taris decides to act on her threat. 
WESLEY: Commander, what about the away team? With the shields up, we
can't beam them back.

Captain's log, supplemental. While there is little
left on the surface of Iconia, we have found what appears to be a
control centre which seems to have remained intact. 
[Iconian Control room]

(There is a central circular control console with a
globe on a pole above it) 
WORF: Come in, Enterprise. Still no response, sir. 
PICARD: Keep trying them. Communications are bound to be erratic. 
WORF: I would not like to become a permanent resident of this planet. 
PICARD: Nor would I, Mister Worf. 
DATA: Scanners show no other life forms on the planet, sir. 
PICARD: I would not expect any. Judging from the severity of
bombardment, I doubt any Iconians survived. Well, Mister Data, let's
see what sense we can make of this. 
DATA: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: This is very reminiscent of Dinasian. 
DATA: Yes, sir. There are also similarities to Dewan and Iccobar. 
PICARD: Is it possible that they could be branches of the same language
family, beginning with Iconian? 
DATA: It is, sir. 
PICARD: Run a comparison using basic simple words from Dinasian, Dewan
and Iccobar. See if we can reconstruct a common root language. 
DATA: Accessing, sir. 
[Bridge]

(Troi twitches) 
RIKER: You're jumpy. 
TROI: The tension on the ship is very high. 
RIKER: What's your recommendation? 
TROI: Give everyone something to do, somewhere to focus their
attention. 
RIKER: All right. Let's consider evacuation. 
TROI: To the planet? 
RIKER: I know it's probably impossible with Taris sitting out there,
but it would give everyone something to do. You go and organise it. 
TROI: But you might need me if you have to negotiate with Taris again. 
RIKER: I'll manage. Right now, they're more important.
