MARLA TROI JEREMY PICARD RIKER CRUSHER

[Aster home]

(Jeremy's quarters have been transformed) 
JEREMY: It's my house. It's my house on Earth. 
MARLA: Exactly the way it was. Remember, Jeremy? 
JEREMY: How did you do it? 
MARLA: Does it matter? 
TROI: Yes, it matters. 
MARLA: I am trying to understand your resistance. You spoke of rocks
and dust on the planet. I decided to show you what awaits us there. 
TROI: Why would you create this fantasy? 
MARLA: It's his home. And it makes you happy, doesn't it? 
TROI: But it's not real. 
MARLA: Isn't it? Jeremy, isn't that really Patches? 
(suddenly there is a kitten on the blanket, washing itself) 
JEREMY: He knows me. It's him. It's real. It's all real. 
TROI: No, it's not. Could your real mother just make all this appear?
You must not stay here. Come with me. 
JEREMY: I can't.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Is the boy in any danger? 
TROI [OC]: I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. 
PICARD: Help him? 
[Aster home]

TROI: By easing his pain. She's very confused by
our resistance, Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremy
from his cabin? 
TROI: He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend taking him

[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: By force. 
RIKER: She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality of
his mother's death. 
CRUSHER: What would you choose? If somebody came along and offered to
give you back your mother, father or husband, would any of us say no so
easily? 
PICARD: Counsellor, stay with them in Jeremy's quarters. 
[Aster home]

PICARD [OC]: We'll try and put an end to this from
here. 
TROI: Understood.
