DATA: The T'Ong has changed course to three two
mark eight one. Increasing to warp three. 
RIKER: Standard evasive manoeuvre. 
PICARD: Helm, stay with them. 
GUEST1: Yes, sir. 
DATA: The T'Ong is now on a heading of four two mark one one three.
They are accelerating to warp five. 
RIKER: They're going to make a break for it. 
PICARD: Overtake, warp eight. 
GUEST1: Aye. 
PICARD: Now, put us right in their path and come to a full stop. Full
power to shields. 
GUEST0: Full power, sir. 
PICARD: Well, we've thrown down the gauntlet. Let's see if they pick it
up. 
DATA: They are slowing to impulse, sir. 
(The ship appears and fires) 
GUEST0: Phaser hit on forward shields. Firming up now. No damage. 
RIKER: I guess we've piqued their interest now. 
PICARD: Agreed. Let's give them the chance to look their enemy in the
face. Ready, Lieutenant? WORF: Open hailing frequencies. 
GUEST0: Open, sir. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What? What is this? 
(Worf and K'Ehleyr are in Klingon uniforms, sitting where Picard and
Riker should be) 
WORF: Captain K'Temoc, have you lost your mind? Halt your vessel and
drop your shields. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: What treachery is this? By whose authority? 
WORF: I am Worf, commanding the Enterprise. And it is you who have
committed an act of treason by firing upon this ship. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have standing orders to fire on all
Federation ships! 
WORF: You fool! Did it not occur to you that the war would be over by
now? 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: I have no proof of that. 
WORF: Trust your eyes. Or is your brain still stuck in its long
slumber? 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: How do I know this is not a Federation trick?
How can I be sure? 
WORF: Captain, as you are new to this century, I have tried to be
patient. But I will tolerate no further insubordination. Drop your
shields. Immediately. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: And if I refuse? 
WORF: Then die in ignorance. I can waste no more time on you. Phasers
to full power. 
GUEST0: Aye, sir. Phasers ready. Target locked. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: You dare not destroy us. We are on a crucial
mission by order of the Klingon High Command. 
WORF: Has the T'Ong dropped its shields? 
GUEST0: No, sir. 
WORF: Very well. Fire all phasers. 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Wait! Lower the shields. I yield command of
the T'Ong to you, Captain Worf. Long live the Klingon Empire. 
WORF: A wise decision, Captain. Commander K'Ehleyr will board your ship
and take command. The Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon arrive and
escort you home. And, Captain 
K'TEMOC [on viewscreen]: Yes? 
WORF: Welcome to the twenty fourth century. 
(Transmission ends. Picard and Riker come out of the Ready room) 
WORF: I return command of the ship to you, Captain. 
PICARD: Thank you, Lieutenant. Congratulations. A very fine first
command. Well done. 
RIKER: How did you like command? 
WORF: Comfortable chair. 
K'EHLEYR: And you wore it well.
