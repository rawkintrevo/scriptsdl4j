threats survivor ahead transferred baton suspiciously teach commander shields

[Great Hall]

WORF: My challenge will proceed. No threats, no
treachery will stop it. Not even a trap set for my cha'DIch by a
coward. 
K'MPEC: Duras! 
DURAS: I will not hear lies from the son of a traitor. 
(Picard steps between Worf and Duras) 
DURAS: Keep your place, Picard! 
PICARD: This is my place. 
WORF: He is now my cha'DIch. 
DURAS: This is not your world, human. You do not command here. 
PICARD: I'm not here to command. 
DURAS: Then you must be ready to fight. Something that Starfleet
doesn't teach you. 
PICARD: You may test that assumption at your convenience. 
(He is handed the ceremonial baton or whatever it is) 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER: I've got something. Worf was not the only
survivor of the Khitomer massacre. 
RIKER: Another child? 
CRUSHER: No. A Klingon woman was found with Worf. 
(She calls up the record on a monitor) 
RIKER: Kahlest. Who was she? 
CRUSHER: I don't know, but the report said she was severely injured,
was transferred to Starbase twenty four for treatment. That was when
she was separated from Worf. And after her recovery, she returned home.

RIKER: We've got to find her, if she's still alive. Data, scan the
Klingon central net. See if there's any record of her.

[Great Hall]

DURAS: The Romulans lowered the outpost shields themselves. They were
given the defense access code! The record clearly show the Romulan
patrol ship receiving a personal transmission from Mogh seconds before
the shields fell. 
RIKER [OC]: Riker to Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Stand by. 
DURAS: The Khitomer commander noted in his log that Mogh had been
acting suspiciously. 
(Picard moves away to take his call privately) 
PICARD: Go ahead, Number One.
