RIKER: Forget the explanation! Can you do it?

[Outside Holodeck]

WESLEY: I don't know if I should. If this isn't
done correctly, the programme could abort and everyone inside could
vanish. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: Do you need more time to study it? 
WESLEY [OC]: Whether we do it now or later, the risk is the same. 
RIKER: Do it. 
[Hill's Office]

PICARD: If we can find away of getting him to our
Sickbay by fixing our computer 
REDBLOCK: Computer? I don't know that word. 
DATA: An electronic or mechanical apparatus capable of carrying out
repetitious or complex mathematical operations at high speed. Computers
are used to control, process, perform, or store 
LEECH: Enough! Let me kill him. He's really beginning to irritate me. 
(Wesley does something, and the office briefly turns into an arctic
snowstorm) 
CRUSHER: Captain, the exit. 
PICARD: That's it. The way into our world. 
REDBLOCK: Remarkable. Is this a two-way passage? Can one enter your
world and return to this one simply by stepping through? 
PICARD: Oh, yes. Allow us to help Mister Whalen, and we will return
with the item. 
REDBLOCK: You really are a scamp, aren't you. Do you actually think I'd
stay here 
DATA: If you were going to go through yourself, sir, that is not
possible. 
REDBLOCK: One look at you, sir, is proof that anything is possible.
Step back, Mister Hill. I'd shoot you myself, but I don't want to
deprive my assistant of his greatest pleasure. After we've gone, kill
them all. Make sure the bodies are never found. 
MCNARY: You're insane. You think you can kill a cop and get away with
it? 
REDBLOCK: Why not? I've done it before. Come on, Mister Leech. Au
revoir et bonne chance, mon ami. Our destiny awaits. 
[Corridor]

REDBLOCK: Another world. A whole new world to
plunder! 
(Leech looks down. They disappearing from the feet upwards) 
REDBLOCK: What is this? What are they doing? They can't do this to me!
Don't they know who I am? I'm Cyrus Redblock! Cyrus Redblock! 
(The corridor is now empty)

[Hill's office]

(Data takes the gun off the Thug, and squeezes the
barrel closed) 
DATA: With your permission, sir? 
PICARD: Permission granted. 
(Data thumps the Thug, very hard) 
PICARD: Data, pick up Whalen. Take him to Sickbay. 
DATA: And you, sir? 
PICARD: I'll follow. You go now. 
(Data, Crusher and Whalen leave) 
PICARD: I wish I could take you with me. 
MCNARY: Someone has to book this creep. Once a cop always a cop, I
guess. 
PICARD: I have to go. 
MCNARY: So this is the big goodbye. Tell me something, Dixon. When
you've gone. will this world still exist? Will my wife and kids still
be waiting for me at home? 
PICARD: I honestly don't know. Good-bye my friend.
