[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Again.
OGAWA: She has a pulse. Blood pressure climbing. Ninety over forty.
Cortical activity approaching normal levels. 
CRUSHER: Let's neutralise the neurotransmitters. Initiate
decontamination sequence.
OGAWA: Levels are dropping, Doctor. Down to four hundred and twenty
percent above normal. Three hundred and ninety percent. 
PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three 
CRUSHER: Not yet. We won't know if it's working till the levels are
below three hundred percent. 
(Alkar's stone begins to glow as Troi wakes up) 
[Alkar's quarters]

(Alkar drops his stone and grabs his head) 
LIVA: Alkar! Alkar, what's wrong? 
[Sickbay]

OGAWA: Neurotransmitter levels are down to three
hundred and ten percent. Two hundred and ninety percent.
CRUSHER: Now. 
PICARD: Picard to Transporter room three, energise.

[Alkar's quarters]

(an aging Alkar has grabbed Liva) 
LIVA: Let me go! 
(she wriggles away, gets beamed out and Worf enters as Alkar gets very
old)

[Sickbay]

(while Troi gets younger again) 
OGAWA: Neurotransmitter levels are down to two hundred and thirty
percent. 
[Alkar's quarters]

(Worf watches impassively as the old man tries to
speak, then falls over. Rigor has already set in.) 
WORF: Worf to Captain Picard. Ambassador Alkar is dead.
