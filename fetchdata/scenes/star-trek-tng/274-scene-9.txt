PICARD TROI BOK JASON

[Jason's quarters]

(doorbell) 
JASON: Yeah? 
TROI: Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. 
JASON: Come in. Did Captain Picard ask you to come talk to me? 
TROI: No, I just thought I'd come and see how you were doing. A lot's
happened in the last few hours. I thought you might like to talk about
it. 
JASON: I'll be all right. People have wanted to kill me before. 
TROI: But you've never met your father before. 
JASON: And I have to admit I never thought I would. 
TROI: It must be somewhat overwhelming. 
JASON: I'm a little shaky. 
TROI: Well, that's only natural. 
JASON: But you know what? I feel better already just talking to you. 
TROI: So, how did you feel about the Captain, about your father? 
JASON: He's okay. A little stiff. But where are you from? 
TROI: I was born on Betazed. 
JASON: Do all the women there have eyes like yours? 
TROI: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship's
Counsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think I
should go. 
JASON: Fine. 
TROI: You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office. 
JASON: Maybe I'll do just that.

[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is sleeping) 
BOK: Picard, can you hear me? 
(Picard wakes to see Bok at the foot of his bed) 
BOK: I will kill him, Picard. And there's nothing you can do about it. 
PICARD: Security to Captain's quarters immediately. 
(but Bok has vanished)
