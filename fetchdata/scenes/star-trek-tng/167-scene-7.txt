[Picard's quarters]

(Picard is in casual clothes - brown trousers and
light blue top, if you really want to know) 
RIKER: I'll see to it that these bags are beamed directly to your room,
sir. 
TROI: You look very handsome, if I might saying so Captain. 
RIKER: Are you taking all these books? 
PICARD: I thought I'd take some light reading in case I got bored. 
RIKER: Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics, Sophistry and the Alternate
Universe by Ving Kuda. You call that light reading? 
PICARD: To each his own, Number One. 
RIKER: Have I mentioned how imaginative the Risian women are, sir? 
TROI: Too often, Commander.

[Corridor]

RIKER: I do have one request, sir. 
PICARD: You want me to bring you back a souvenir? 
RIKER: It's called a Horga'hn. I don't think you'll have any trouble
finding one. 
PICARD: Consider it done. 
WORF: Captain, I would feel better if you would allow me to assign a
security officer to you. We will be out of communication range when we
leave orbit. 
PICARD: I really don't think that will be necessary, Mister Worf. Risa
has a reputation of being a most peaceful planet. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Well, the ship is yours, Number One. 
TROI: Enjoy your trip, Captain. 
PICARD: I'll try, Counsellor. 
(Picard enters the transporter room) 
RIKER: He's going to have a great time.
