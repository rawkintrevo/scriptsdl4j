[Bridge] 
TASHA: Ship's power drain is critical, Captain. I
must now shut down our shields to maintain life support systems. 
PICARD: Understood. Open hailing frequencies. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Ferengi vessel from Enterprise, come in. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Your alien images again shock us. 
PICARD: With regard to the surrender, DaiMon Tarr. The facts are
somewhat different. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Our own probe has already shown us your trickery,
human. We withdraw our surrender. 
PICARD: Agreed. Perhaps you would agree to a more productive
relationship? 
TARR [on viewscreen]: I prefer a more profitable one, human. 
DATA: Yankee trader. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Explain what means yankee traders? 
LAFORGE: He heard that. 
PICARD: He recognises your interest in profit. Or is that an incorrect
assumption? 
TARR [on viewscreen]: We seek only what is equitable. What do you seek?
Why did you begin by attacking us? 
PICARD: We did not attack you. We gave chase in order to recover a
Federation-owned energy device which 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Which we know is ours. Your barbarous Federation
placed it on one of our planets! 
PICARD: On the contrary, Gamma Tauri Four is recognised by all
civilised members of 
TARR [on viewscreen]: The Ferengi are not uncivilised, human! Are you
suggesting otherwise? 
PICARD: All I'm saying is that you removed something which clearly did
not belong to you. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Are you now calling us thieves?! 
PICARD: On the contrary, I have no wish to discuss issues of property
or of territory, when our mutual problem remains. Like it or not, we
are both trapped by this energy draining forcefield from the planet. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: On that matter there can be no argument. 
PICARD: I would like to propose a swap. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: And what is a swap? 
PICARD: It's a trade, an exchange. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Yes, trade, human. What do you offer? 
PICARD: We will tell you what we know about the planet, and in trade,
you will give us your information. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Ridiculous. How will we know you will not
withhold information? 
PICARD: We must trust each other, Tarr. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: Amusing, human. Trust each other? 
PICARD: I propose that we test this relationship by cooperating in a
joint exploration of the planet surface. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: And what profit is in this, Picard Captain? 
PICARD: The profit, DaiMon Tarr, of saving all our lives. 
TARR [on viewscreen]: We will agree, no doubt foolishly. But you are
warned that any further trickery on your part will be met with no
mercy. 
PICARD: Agreed. If you care to join us, we have a well-proven
transporter device 
TARR [on viewscreen]: We have a matter-energy device of our own. We
will beam a science team of three to whatever
co-ordinates you propose. 
PICARD: Excellent. We will transmit the information shortly. Enterprise
out. 
TASHA: Hailing frequencies off. 
PICARD: I would log that agreement as promising, at least. 
RIKER: I wonder, Captain. I'm not usually one for distrust at first
sight, but this may be an exception. 
DATA: Especially in view of the fact the image he transmitted, sir, was
somehow distorted. 
TROI: I sensed the same thing, Captain. He's hiding something. 
RIKER: With this power drain we can't delay. Now, I'd like some
additional help in case we run into trouble. Can you spare Worf? 
PICARD: Take him. And be careful, Number One.

[Transporter room]

DATA: With this power drain, we may have trouble
communicating with the Enterprise, sir. 
RIKER: Understood. Anything else? 
DATA: Due to this forcefield, there is presently no way to beam us
back, sir. 
LAFORGE: You had to ask. 
RIKER: Understood. Energise.
