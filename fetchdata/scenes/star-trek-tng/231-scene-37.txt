DATA: Without further reinforcement, containment
field integrity will fail in approximately fourteen minutes.

PICARD: Can you divert more power to the
containment field? 
LAFORGE: I can try to augment the field with auxiliary power, but it
won't be much. 
PICARD: Make it so. 
LAFORGE: Aye, sir.

shuffles off again. The emitter starts beeping)

LAFORGE: Captain, I've located the homing signal.
Locking onto it now. It's coming from a subspace energy level of
sixteen point two keV. 
PICARD: Stand by to initiate the graviton pulse. 
SHIPLEY: Graviton emitters at full power, sir. Standing by. 
PICARD: Mister Data, how much time? 
[Cargo bay]

DATA: At the present rate, containment failure will
occur in approximately nine minutes.

DATA: Captain, the containment field is beginning
to fluctuate. Failure anticipated in

DATA [OC]: Three minutes, eleven seconds. 
PICARD: We can't afford to wait any longer. Begin the graviton pulse. 
LAFORGE: Initiating pulse now.
