PICARD: And I found these pieces in the tertiary
level of the dig. They're typical of second century Marlonian cookware.
Look at those markings. They're very similar to early Taguan designs,
but the patterns are more intricate, they're much closer to Buranian
than Taguan. 
GUINAN: You were on the most beautiful planet in the quadrant and you
spent your entire shore leave in a cave? 
PICARD: It was a very rewarding experience. Look at these fragments.
They're very nearly in perfect condition and yet they're seven hundred
years old. 
GUINAN: So's my father. 
RO: Is that a Draebidium froctus? 
(Keiko has a tray of plants on her lap) 
KEIKO: Actually, it's a Draebidium calimus. You can tell by the shape
of the leaves. I didn't know you were interested in plant biology. 
RO: I took a class at the Academy. I Don't remember very much though. 
WORF [OC]: Enterprise to shuttlecraft Fermi. 
RO: This is the Fermi. Go ahead Enterprise. 
WORF [OC]: We have just received a distress signal from the Starfleet
science team on Ligos Seven. 
PICARD: Can you identify the problem? 
WORF [OC]: No, sir. The call was cut off in mid-transmission. 
PICARD: Lay in a course and prepare to engage at warp eight as soon as
we're on board. 
WORF [OC]: Aye, sir. 
RO: We'll rendezvous with the ship in three minutes, sir. 
(but then they enter a blue swirly thing) 
RO: We're caught in some kind of energy field. 
PICARD: Hard about, full impulse. 
RO: Aye, sir.
