[Bridge]

RIKER: We could ride it through the rift and then
break away once we're clear. That is, if we survive the ride. 
PICARD: Is everyone off the Fleming? 
WORF: The last of the crew has been beamed aboard, sir. 
PICARD: All right, Mister La Forge, get us out of here. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Yes, sir. Phase matching the deflectors
shield now. 
[Bridge]

DATA: The next distortion wave will impact in
fourteen seconds. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Matching phases. Prepare to engage the
deflector shield on my mark. 
DATA [OC]: Ten seconds. 
LAFORGE: And mark. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power. 
(whumph)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We lost it. 
[Engineering]

DATA: We were unable to maintain phase match with
the distortion wave, sir. 
PICARD: What went wrong, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: The speed differential was too high, Captain. 
DATA: Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in twenty six
seconds. 
RIKER: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many more
jolts like that. 
DATA: Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we can
attain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits. 
PICARD: Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. Mister Worf,
channel all available power to the structural integrity fields. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Stand by deflector shield. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're ready, Captain. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Distortion wave impact in five seconds. 
PICARD: Engage deflector shield, now. 
(and they start paddling hard to catch this wave. Whumph) 
DATA: We are now within the distortion wave. Hull stresses have
exceeded maximum tolerance. 
WORF: Structural integrity fields are failing on decks ten through
sixteen. Switching
to backups.
