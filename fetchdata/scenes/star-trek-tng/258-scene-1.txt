WORKMAN DATA LAFORGE

  [Corridor]

(the corridor is empty and slightly distorted.
Geordi is standing still against a bulkhead) 
LAFORGE: Data, there you are. We need to install that plasma conduit
right away. We're bringing the new warp core on line in less than three
hours. 
DATA: I will go to deck twenty and begin modifications. 
LAFORGE: Great. I'll meet you in Engineering as soon as you're finished
there. This ought to be a lot of fun. 
(Data walks on, until he reaches an intersection. There is the sound of
an old telephone ringing, then he sees three nineteenth century style
workmen hacking a hole the bulkhead with picks) 
DATA: Excuse me. Do you have authorisation to work in this area? You
are dismantling a warp plasma conduit. I must ask you to stop. 
(the next sound out of Data's mouth is a high pitched tone) 
WORKMAN: Be quiet! 
(they pull Data apart, literally)

(Data wakes from his nightmare)
