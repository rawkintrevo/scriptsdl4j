[Ard'rian's home]

ARD'RIAN: You really think we'll have to leave Tau
Cygna Five? 
DATA: The possibility does exist, yet Gosheven seems unwilling to
prepare for it. Why? 
ARD'RIAN: Maybe because you're an android. I don't think Gosheven likes
the idea of machines ordering him around. 
DATA: I am not ordering him to do anything. I am merely trying to
persuade him that his people should prepare to evacuate. Do you believe
my suggested course of action should be followed? 
ARD'RIAN: Of course. 
DATA: In spite of the fact that I am an android? 
ARD'RIAN: Because of that fact. I don't have any silly prejudice
against computers. I like them. Not that any computer we have is half
as sophisticated as you are. 
(Data looks around) 
DATA: No, I would say not. 
ARD'RIAN: People can be selfish, irrational, stubborn, malicious, you
name it. But computers don't have those failings. 
DATA: And you conclude because of this that I am impartial. Hence, you
accept my recommendations? Yet Gosheven does not. 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Commander Data. 
DATA: Data here. 
PICARD [OC]: The Sheliak won't bargain. 
DATA: Understood, sir. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: I'm contacting Starfleet to arrange
transport. Get those people prepared to evacuation. We may have to move
quickly. 
[Ard'rian's home]

DATA: Aye, sir. We must speak to Gosheven
immediately.

(A test object is beamed out successfully, but
returns as a molten blob. Riker enters) 
RIKER: Gentlemen, how's it coming? What the hell is that? 
LAFORGE: Our first attempt. 
RIKER: Keep at it. We need those transporters.
