[Ready room]

TROI: In our dealings with other non-humanoid races
there has been some point of reference. Not so with the Sheliak. 
PICARD: But we must have something in common. We communicate. 
TROI: Barely. They have learned several Federation languages, but
theirs continues to elude us. 
PICARD: Telepaths? 
TROI: Attempted and failed. Actually, the fact that any alien race
communicates with another is quite remarkable. We are stranded on a
planet. We have no language in common, but I want to teach you mine.
(she hold up his cup of tea) S'smarith. What did I just say? 
PICARD: Cup? Glass? 
TROI: Are you sure? I may have meant liquid, clear, brown, hot. We
conceptualise the universe in relatively the same way. 
PICARD: Point taken. 
TROI: In your talks, you must be extremely accurate. The treaty is five
hundred thousand words. The length was to accommodate the Sheliak. They
consider our language irrational, and demanded this level of complexity
to avoid any future misunderstandings. 
RIKER [OC]: Captain, we have the vessel carrying the Sheliak colonists
on visual. 
PICARD: On my way. So, it begins.
