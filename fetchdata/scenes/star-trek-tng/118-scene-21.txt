[Artist's Unit]

ACCOLAN: You see, Harry, I told you you were going
to be an artist. 
HARRY: Are you sure? Did I really do this? 
ACCOLAN: Oh, yes. Your talent has always been there. The sculpting tool
is just helping you develop it. It's what you were meant to do. 
HARRY: You mean I don't have to take calculus anymore? 
ACCOLAN: You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. What's
calculus? 
HARRY: Nothing important. Can I do some more?

PICARD: Captain's log, supplemental. It has been
three days since the Aldeans pushed us away. We have had no contact
with Radue since then.

PICARD: Open hailing frequencies, Lieutenant Yar. 
TASHA: Frequencies open, sir. 
PICARD: Radue, this is Picard. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: Welcome back, Captain. What have you decided? 
PICARD: That there is room for discussion, Radue. 
RADUE [on viewscreen]: We will bring you down when we are ready. 
PICARD: Data, find a way to defeat that shield. 
DATA: That may be impossible, sir. 
PICARD: Things are only impossible until they're not. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Crusher enters.) 
CRUSHER: Captain. Here's what I've learned so far. Duana is dying. I
have no reason to believe the rest of the Aldeans are any healthier.
They're suffering from some kind of chromosomal damage. It could be
genetic or environmental. 
PICARD: And is that why they can't conceive? 
CRUSHER: Yes. It also explains their lack of appetite, extreme pallor
and sensitivity to light. 
PICARD: An entire civilisation that's terminally ill. Is it reversible?

CRUSHER: I won't know until I find the cause. And you don't need to
tell me time is running out. 
PICARD: Good work, Doctor.

ACCOLAN: Have the lesions gone? 
LEDA: Yes. The medicine worked again. 
ACCOLAN: Good. Come see what Harry's doing. Beautiful! 
(Harry is polishing a sculpture) 
HARRY: Yeah, it really turned out well. 
ACCOLAN: It is so alive and graceful. What do you call it? 
HARRY: It's a dolphin. 
LEDA: Dolphin? 
HARRY: You know, it swims in the ocean. Like a fish, only it's not a
fish. 
LEDA: Ah. A fish. We used to have them in our oceans. I've never seen
one before. 
HARRY: I used to live near the ocean on Zadar Four. My dad's an
oceanographer. He says that. Never mind. It doesn't matter.
