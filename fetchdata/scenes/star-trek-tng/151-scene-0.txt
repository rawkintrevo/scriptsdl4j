RIKER WORF PICARD TROI WESLEY CRUSHER DATA

[Bridge]

RIKER: Shields up, maximum strength. 
WORF: Shields up. Sensors do not indicate the presence of any armed
space vehicles operating in the Rana system. 
PICARD: They could be cloaked, or otherwise shielded. Mister Crusher,
bring us in well clear of the planet's three moons. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Captain, we are not receiving Rana Four's call sign. 
RIKER: Open a frequency to Colony Operations. 
DATA: No response. Rana Four is emissions quiet. 
TROI: Captain, there are eleven thousand inhabitants in this colony. At
this range, I should be sensing something. I'm not. 
PICARD: Mister Data, put the planet on the main viewer. Magnify. 
(a scene of bare devastation) 
CRUSHER: My God! 
RIKER: Helm, put us in high equatorial orbit. Scan for survivors. 
CRUSHER: Survivors? Down there? 
DATA: Sensors are scanning ninety degrees of longitude as we orbit. I
am detecting no bodies of water, no vegetation, no artificial
structures. 
WORF: Life form readings are negative. 
TROI: Could the colonists have escaped? 
DATA: That is highly unlikely. Rana Four possessed no interstellar
spacecraft. 
RIKER: Who would cause devastation on that order? 
WESLEY: Hold it. Captain, I've got something here. Thirty seven degrees
north and sixty two degrees east. It's a structure. 
PICARD: Life? 
WORF: Two life forms, possibly human. 
PICARD: Put that area on the main viewer. Magnify. 
(amid the brown bleakness, a green square. Totally out of place) 
DATA: The structure is located at the centre of the vegetation. 
RIKER: An entire planet obliterated except for a few acres of trees and
grass and one building? 
CRUSHER: It must be some kind of illusion. 
DATA: Negative. It is as you see it. 
PICARD: Number One, I think you had better see who's at home.
