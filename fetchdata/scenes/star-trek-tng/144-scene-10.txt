RIKER WORF CREWMAN DANILO PICARD PULASKI

[Corridor]

DANILO: Captain! Captain, t'was very good of you,
sir, to rescue us from our troubles. 
PICARD: My pleasure. 
DANILO: Sir, you must be worth quite a bit to own a fine ship like
this. 
PICARD: I don't own the Enterprise, I command her. 
DANILO: Whatever. Sir, would you happen to be married? 
PICARD: No. Why? 
DANILO: No? Well, you see, sir, I have a daughter. 
PICARD: Felicitations. 
DANILO: Would you be interested, sir?
PICARD: No. 
DANILO: You're quite sure? 
PICARD: Quite sure. 
DANILO: He's quite sure. 
[Observation lounge]

PICARD: What's the total? 
WORF: Two hundred and twenty three. 
PULASKI: Count on two more in the next few days. 
PICARD: Set course for the nearest starbase. 
PULASKI: You know, they were anachronistic in 2123. It will be
interesting to see how they cope. 
RIKER: They'll learn and adapt. If Danilo Odell's any indication,
they'll be running this place inside of a week. 
(and alarm sounds) 
WORF: Lieutenant Worf, here. Report. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Fire in cargo hold seven. 
RIKER: The Bringloidi. 
PICARD: What have they done to my ship now?
