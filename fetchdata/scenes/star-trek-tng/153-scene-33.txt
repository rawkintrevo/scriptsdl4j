PICARD: Is the boy in any danger? 
TROI [OC]: I don't think so. She seems to want to help him. 
PICARD: Help him? 
[Aster home]

TROI: By easing his pain. She's very confused by
our resistance, Captain. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Troi, would it be wise to remove Jeremy
from his cabin? 
TROI: He doesn't want to leave. I would not recommend taking him

[Bridge]

TROI [OC]: By force. 
RIKER: She offers him everything. All we offer is the cold reality of
his mother's death. 
CRUSHER: What would you choose? If somebody came along and offered to
give you back your mother, father or husband, would any of us say no so
easily? 
PICARD: Counsellor, stay with them in Jeremy's quarters. 
[Aster home]

PICARD [OC]: We'll try and put an end to this from
here. 
TROI: Understood.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Data, can you determine for certain that
the energy source from the planet is powering this creation? 
DATA: The beam from the planet is clearly tapping into the ship's
anti-matter, Captain. 
LAFORGE: I'd say they're running the manifestation off our own energy. 
PICARD: So there are limits to her power. 
RIKER: She needs the transporter to get the boy back. 
PICARD: So how do we cut the puppet's strings? 
LAFORGE: Increasing the shield harmonics to match our own antimatter
containment fields will probably sever the beam. 
PICARD: Proceed. 
RIKER: Deanna, stand by. 
TROI [OC]: Standing by.
