[Corridor]

PICARD: (to computer) Picard. Access. 
(Picard and Riker enter the Weapons Room)

Captain's log, supplemental. We now know who has
commandeered the Enterprise. The Bynars. We can't communicate with the
Bridge. Commander Riker and I will now try to regain control of our
ship. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: This way. 
RIKER: That's toward Engineering. 
PICARD: That's our first stop. Verify containment and initiate
auto-destruct. 
RIKER: Initiate auto-destruct? 
PICARD: Our ship has been commandeered by a force of unknown size and
intent. We're here alone. We must assume the worst.

[Engineering]

PICARD: If we don't regain control, then no one
else must have it either. Now, this is the one decision involving the
operation of this vessel which requires you and I to be in total
agreement. 
RIKER: It's the time allotted that concerns me. 
PICARD: As to that, there's no option. 
RIKER: I know. It's a five minute countdown. 
PICARD: That's sufficient to get to the Bridge. Once there, either
we'll get control of the ship and shut off the auto-destruct, or we
won't. This vessel must not fall into hostile hands. 
RIKER: Then let's set it and get going. 
(They place their hands on computer screens) 
COMPUTER: (male) Recognise Picard, Jean-Luc, Captain. Recognise Riker,
William T, Commander. 
PICARD: Set auto-destruct sequence. 
COMPUTER: Does the First Officer concur? 
RIKER: Yes. Set auto-destruct sequence. Now. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct will detonate in four minutes and fifty-nine
seconds. 
PICARD: The only place we can stop this is on the Bridge. Let's go.
(Riker spots strange symbols flashing across a wall display) 
RIKER: What do you make of this, sir? 
PICARD: An enormous amount of data is being received and stored in the
main computer. 
RIKER: Just stored. Why? 
PICARD: It's another piece to of puzzle.

[Outside Turbolift]

COMPUTER: Bridge access denied. 
PICARD: They've locked it off. We must find another way to get in. 
RIKER: One of us could beam into the Bridge. 
PICARD: No, it takes several seconds to materialise. You wouldn't stand
a chance. 
RIKER: I could beam into the turbolift, force the doors, take them by
surprise. 
PICARD: No, we'll both beam in simultaneously in two different areas of
the Bridge. With luck one of us will be a distraction. 
RIKER: There must be only four minutes left.

[Starbase Command Centre]

LAFORGE: Still no response from the Enterprise. 
WORF: They would answer if they could. Someone else has control of the
ship. 
DATA: Do you think I am responsible? 
LAFORGE: Responsible? How could you possibly have known? 
DATA: My station is on the Bridge. 
LAFORGE: You can't be on the Bridge every second, Data. 
DATA: You are wrong, Geordi. I can. I do not need rest or diversion. I
should not have been painting. I was negligent. 
TASHA: It's a pointless discussion, Data. You could have been on the
Bridge and it still might have happened.
Commander Quinteros, you have three ships in here. We need one of them
now. 
QUINTEROS: We're rushing repairs on the USS Melbourne, but it's still
eighteen hours until she'll be ready. There's nothing else you can do.

[Transporter Room]

PICARD: Set coordinates for main Bridge. Port
forward for me and aft for you. 
RIKER: You're on pad two. I've set a ten second delay.
PICARD: Set phasers on stun. Number One, good luck. 
[Bridge]

(Picard and Riker beam in but there is no
resistance. The four Bynars are lying propped up against each other,
and do not seem well) 
RIKER: Over here, Captain. 
PICARD: Why did you steal my ship? 
ONE ZERO: Please try to 
ZERO ONE: help us. 
(They pass out again. The Enterprise enters planetary orbit as the
countdown passes two minutes) 
PICARD: Cancel auto-destruct. 
COMPUTER: (male) Does the First Officer agree? 
RIKER: Affirmative. 
COMPUTER: Auto-destruct cancelled. 
RIKER: We're in orbit around Bynaus. How are they? 
PICARD: They appear dead. Let's see if we can get some answers from
Bynaus. 
RIKER: Their main computer is off. All sensors reveal that all of the
equipment on the planet is inert. They can neither receive nor send any
messages. 
PICARD: What about all the people in that world who are totally
dependant on their computer? Are they still functioning? 
RIKER: They're probably like these Bynars here. Dying. What is this all
about? Why did they steal the ship and bring it here? What is their
purpose? 
PICARD: They went to an awful lot of trouble to clear computer space.
Let's see what they've stored. 
RIKER: Captain, it's enormous. Every byte of free space in the computer
has been filled. They must have made a core-dump from their world to
our computer. I can't get in. I wish they'd left a note. 
PICARD: Maybe they did. 
RIKER: Minuet. 
PICARD: Maybe.
