CLANCY DATA LAFORGE

[Engineering]

CLANCY: Yes, Commander? 
DATA: Is there a problem? Chief Engineer La Forge called for me,
urgent. 
CLANCY: Oh, of course. He's over there, with the Victory. 
DATA: Geordi, I just had a strange conversation with your assistant.
Although it is three days until we rendezvous with starship Victory,
she 
LAFORGE: She believes it has already arrived? Not the starship, my
friend. The original. 
(in a side alcove is a wonderful replica of HMS Victory, bunting and
all) 
LAFORGE: This is my gift to the Victory's Captain Zimbata. 
DATA: Most unusual. 
LAFORGE: I served with him an ensign. Sure wish he'd been in command of
this Victory. Wind and sail, that's the proper way to move a ship. 
DATA: But, Geordi, your Starfleet specialty is antimatter power,
dilithium regulators 
LAFORGE: That's exactly why this fascinates me, Data. You see, it's
human nature to love what we don't have. Simpler days, huh? Anyway,
stringing this rigging has made me dream of handling sails. 
DATA: This is not a computer simulation? 
LAFORGE: Data, the whole point in doing something like this is to make
it by hand. 
DATA: Geordi, your message said urgent. 
LAFORGE: So it is. While we're waiting to rendezvous with Victory, we
have time for me to be Watson. More properly, your Watson. 
(Geordi hands Data a meerschaum pipe) 
DATA: My Watson? 
LAFORGE: I've just shown you one of my dreams, now let's go and share
in one of yours. 
DATA: Ah, yes. That does seem only fair. 
LAFORGE: Clancy, I'll be gone awhile. See that no one touches this. 
CLANCY: Aye, sir. And where can I reach you? 
DATA: He can be reached at 221B Baker Street. 
CLANCY: Sir?
