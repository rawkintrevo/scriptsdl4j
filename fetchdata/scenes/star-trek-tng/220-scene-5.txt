PICARD RIKER LWAXANA ALEXANDER

[Corridor]

PICARD: Married? She's getting married? 
RIKER: Yes. If we stay on our present course, we should rendezvous with
her intended groom in thirty one hours. 
PICARD: I will not continue have that woman continuing to use this ship
for her convenience, simply because her daughter happens to be one of
my officers. 
RIKER: Apparently, Deanna being on board is only part of the reason. 
PICARD: The other reason being? 
RIKER: She thinks the honour of giving away the bride should fall on
you. 
PICARD: Permission for an on-board wedding is granted, Number One.
Nothing would please me more than to give away Mrs. Troi.

[Troi's office]

(Alexander is playing with a table monitor when
Lwaxana enters) 
LWAXANA: Ah! My little warrior. And how are you this morning? Oh, I
see. Being punished for something, are we? 
ALEXANDER: It's just my regular time to meet with Counsellor Troi.
She's not here yet. 
LWAXANA: Then you're early. That's very responsible of you. 
ALEXANDER: No, I just wanted to be out of my room before 
LWAXANA: Before what? Now, if we're to be real friends, we've got to
share only the truth. 
ALEXANDER: Why? 
LWAXANA: Well, for one thing, it's easier. When you tell the truth, you
never have to remember later what you lied about. But mostly, a true
friend is a person you can always tell the truth to without worrying
about it. 
ALEXANDER: I wanted to leave before my father got back. 
LWAXANA: Oh. 
ALEXANDER: I hate him. I wish my mother was here. But she died. 
LWAXANA: That's not very fair, is it. 
ALEXANDER: All he cares about are rules. I'm supposed to do everything
right all the time. I don't know how. 
LWAXANA: To tell you the truth, little warrior, neither do I. But, I do
know one marvellous thing we can do with rules. 
ALEXANDER: I'm supposed to wait for Counsellor Troi. 
LWAXANA: Exactly.
