PULASKI TROI KYLE

[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Poor guy. Picked up a flu virus on our
last stop at Nasreldine. 
KYLE: Sounds nasty. What's the therapy? 
PULASKI: Tryptophan-lysine distillates with generous doses of PCS. 
KYLE: PCS? 
PULASKI: Pulaski's chicken soup. 
KYLE: You haven't lost your touch, haven't you? 
PULASKI: I like to help. When they hurt, I hurt. 
TROI: Commander Pulaski's greatest medical skill is her empathy. You
must be Commander Riker's father. 
KYLE: Yes, but how? 
TROI: We've all heard about you, and I felt certain things. 
PULASKI: This is Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor. 
KYLE: Kyle Riker. 
PULASKI: I thought you two should meet. Deanna's job is to keep us from
deluding ourselves. 
KYLE: Let me guess. Betazoid? 
TROI: At your service. 
PULASKI: I have some lab work to do. If you'll excuse me.

[Doctor's office]

KYLE: Why do I get the feeling that this is a
set-up? 
TROI: Because you are intelligent, wise and quite correct. 
KYLE: Well, I've never been set up better, that's for sure 
TROI: You're also very anxious about something. It's Will, isn't it?
You're not as close to him as you'd like to be. 
KYLE: Oh, I don't know. We both have pretty good taste in women,
wouldn't you say? 
TROI: I'd like to help you if I can. If you'll let me. 
KYLE: Fine. What is it you want from me? I came here to bury the
hatchet with my son only to find out the ground was frozen solid. 
TROI: You don't seem to be the kind of man to give up so easily. 
KYLE: I didn't say I was giving up. It would just be nice to get a
little something from him. 
TROI: What is it you want from him? 
KYLE: I don't know. Acknowledgement, maybe or 
TROI: Respect is earned, not bestowed. 
KYLE: Respect? I don't need that from him. 
TROI: Perhaps you want him to be proud of you. You carry great pride in
his accomplishments. 
KYLE: Absolutely. Look at him. First Officer of the Enterprise, just
been offered his first command. 
TROI: Yet you covet his success. 
KYLE: Please. He'd be lucky to have the career I've had. 
TROI: True, you're well respected in your field. 
KYLE: I may have something of a reputation for excellence 
TROI: And false humility. 
KYLE: My guess is that Will finds you pretty fascinating. Candour seems
to be a trait he admires. 
TROI: Honesty is the trait he admires most. And you should honestly
consider why you're so competitive with your own son. 
KYLE: Competitive? Maybe in the past. But I've come here to help Will
prepare for his first task as captain. 
TROI: Are you sure he'll accept such a dangerous assignment? 
KYLE: He'll accept it just because it is dangerous. 
TROI: How can you be so sure? 
KYLE: Because I would. And we aren't so different, Will and I.
