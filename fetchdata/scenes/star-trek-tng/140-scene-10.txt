RIKER KYLE WORF

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Come in. Worf? 
WORF: May I have a moment, sir? 
RIKER: Of course. What is it? 
WORF: It is very difficult to say. Words are not always easy for me. Is
that Earth? 
(Riker has a picture of himself as a boy on his monitor) 
RIKER: Yes. Alaska. I was nine years old. 
WORF: That is a fish you are holding. 
RIKER: And I didn't even catch it. 
WORF: But it looks like you were 
RIKER: I hooked it. My father took the rod away. He wouldn't let me
reel it in. He was afraid that I might lose it. 
WORF: You do not have good feelings for your father? 
RIKER: No, I. I'm not sure what I'm feeling. What's on your mind? 
WORF: You plan to leave the Enterprise. 
RIKER: I've been offered my own command. 
WORF: I would like to join you. 
RIKER: I haven't accepted the assignment yet 
WORF: But sir, it could be a dangerous mission. There may be the
potential for combat. 
RIKER: That is not the purpose of the mission. 
WORF: Still, to die a true hero 
RIKER: Worf, you've made your point. 
WORF: Then I know you will do the right thing.

[Observation lounge]

KYLE: Finally. We're alone. Maybe now we can talk. 
RIKER: I'm here for the briefing, sir. 
KYLE: All you need to know is here. 
(Riker picks up the computer chip) 
RIKER: These mission details could have been transmitted. 
KYLE: I've been hearing some good things about you. 
RIKER: Then why haven't I heard from you? 
KYLE: I know. Keeping in touch is not my strong suit. It's a funny
thing about being a parent. There aren't any tech manuals. No quick
readouts to get you to the next set of variables. You just got to wing
it from day to day. Will, when your mother died 
RIKER: Excuse me. I've got to study this mission briefing. 
KYLE: Will. I came to the Enterprise because. Look, considering where
you might be going, I wanted to. I'm here with my hand out, son.
