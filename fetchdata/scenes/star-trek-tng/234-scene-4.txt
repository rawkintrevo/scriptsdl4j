DATA LAFORGE WORF ALEXANDER

[Deadwood, main street]

(two figures walk into town, spurs a-jingling. They
are wearing badges) 
WORF: Where are we? 
ALEXANDER: Deadwood. Nineteenth century Earth. The Ancient West. 
WORF: What is our function here? 
ALEXANDER: You're the Sheriff and I'm the deputy. 
WORF: So, we are in law enforcement. 
ALEXANDER: Right. 
[Engineering]

(La Forge is plugging a cable into an interface) 
DATA: Geordi, I have noticed that you have not shaved. Are you
attempting to grow another beard? 
LAFORGE: As a matter of fact, I am, Data. What do you think? 
DATA: As is the case with many natural growth processes, it is
difficult to envision the end product based on an intermediate stage. 
LAFORGE: You're right. Give it a few more days. 
(La Forge plugs the other ends of the cable into Data's head) 
LAFORGE: Okay, I'm going to need to access your auxiliary inputs. 
DATA: One moment. 
(Data taps the back of his head and another panel opens up) 
LAFORGE: I must admit, Data, I never get used to seeing you like this. 
DATA: I do not understand. You are constantly working on similar
electronic systems, yet their appearances do not disturb you. 
LAFORGE: But you're not just another electronic system. 
DATA: Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you just another biological organism. 
LAFORGE: All right, that should do it. Are you ready? 
DATA: Yes. Establishing computer linkup. Interface complete. 
LAFORGE: All right, let's see what you can do.

[Deadwood, main street]

(a woman in a state of extreme undress whistles at
Worf from a balcony) 
WORF: You wrote this holodeck programme yourself? 
ALEXANDER: Well, Mister Barclay helped a little. 
WORF: I must have a little talk with Mister Barclay. 
(the sound of a gunshot)
