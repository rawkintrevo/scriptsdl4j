TROI OBRIEN LAFORGE PICARD RIKER DATA

[Moon surface]

(an explosive charge blows off the rear emergency
hatch) 
TROI: Your arm. 
RIKER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's broken. Enterprise? 
DATA: It is unlikely that we will be able to establish communication
with the ship, given the electromagnetic interference. 
RIKER: We'll stay in the area until the Enterprise finds us. Take an
inventory of the shuttle. See if there's anything left in there that's
usable. The ground cover is all non-porous rock, which makes me believe
it's even less likely there's anyone living here. 
DATA: There are no instruments left of practical value that have not
been damaged by our landing, sir. 
TROI: What is that? 
RIKER: That doesn't look like any storm front I've ever seen. 
DATA: The tricorder is picking up high levels of EM bursts across the
spectrum. No lifesign readings other than our own. 
TROI: There is someone alive here. I'm more certain of it now than
ever. 
RIKER: Well, I hope they can find us, because there's no way we'll find
them. 
TROI: They're coming. They're coming with the storm. 
[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: We can't get a pattern lock on their
communicators because of the EM bursts, Captain. There's no way we can
beam them out of there, not under these conditions. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: The same conditions won't permit a shuttle
to land safely, Mister LaForge. Any suggestions? 
O'BRIEN [OC]: Give us a minute, Captain. 
[Transporter room]

O'BRIEN: Sir, let me beam down with a pattern
enhancer. 
LAFORGE: Chief, there's no guarantee you won't rematerialise in a
million pieces if your signal gets caught up in that electromagnetic
whirlwind. 
O'BRIEN: I can boost the confinement beam. One person might be able to
make it. 
LAFORGE: Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to beam down to the surface with
a pattern enhancer.
