[Engineering]

DATA: If we can use phase buffers we may be able to
devise a mechanism that can be integrated into the present system while
it is in operation. 
(Amanda appears. Data and Geordi stare at her. She's about to leave
when Q sticks his head out of the warp core) 
Q: You're still thinking like a human.

[Enterprise hull]

(They are standing on the rear hull, and Amanda is
entranced by being in space.)

[Amanda's quarters]

Q: Now do you understand? What do humans have to
offer you that even begins to compare with that? Your future contains
wonders you can't even imagine. The universe could be your playground. 
(doorbell) 
AMANDA: Doctor Crusher and Counsellor Troi. They're taking me to
dinner. 
Q: You don't have to eat, you know. It's a nasty human habit you could
easily do without. 
(Q vanishes and Amanda opens the door) 
CRUSHER: Hello, Amanda. Are you ready? 
AMANDA: Yes.

[Ten Forward]

(Amanda has barely touched her food) 
TROI: Well, Amanda, how are you feeling about all this now? It must be
overwhelming. 
AMANDA: It was at first, but actually now I'm enjoying myself. 
RIKER: Hello, ladies. 
TROI: Hello, Will. 
AMANDA: Commander Riker. Er, won't you join us? 
RIKER: I'd love, to but I have other plans. 
(He joins a woman at another table right in front of Amanda) 
RIKER: Hi. 
WOMAN: Hi. 
CRUSHER: So, how are your lessons going? Is Q being patient with you?
Amanda? 
(Amanda and Riker vanish)

[Gazebo]

(Both are in Regency clothing) 
RIKER: What is this all about? 
AMANDA: I thought it might be nice to spend some time alone together. 
RIKER: I think it would be nice if you took us back to Ten Forward. 
AMANDA: Are you sure you wouldn't want to stay here with me for a
while? The moonlight is so beautiful. Isn't it nicer here than at Ten
Forward? 
RIKER: Yes, it's very pleasant, but that's not the point. 
AMANDA: Oh? I think it is. 
(She puts her arms around his neck) 
RIKER: No. You can't just snatch people and put them in your fantasies
and expect them to respond. 
AMANDA: Don't you like me? Even just a little bit? 
RIKER: You're a very lovely young lady. But none of this is real. 
AMANDA: My feelings are real. 
RIKER: I know. But you can't make someone love you. 
AMANDA: Can't I? 
(and with a small gesture) 
RIKER: Oh, Amanda. You are so beautiful. 
(he kisses her neck) 
AMANDA: Do you love me? 
RIKER: More than anything. 
AMANDA: You're right. None of this is real. I thought it would be
romantic, but it's empty. 
RIKER: Amanda. 
AMANDA: Just go back to Ten Forward.
