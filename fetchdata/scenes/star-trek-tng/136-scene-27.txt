[Ten forward]

SALIA: This has all been so wonderful. I'm not even
sure it's real. 
WESLEY: Believe me, Ten Forward isn't an illusion. 
SALIA: Not that. I mean the way I feel. 
GUINAN: You won't find a better dish of chocolate anywhere. 
SALIA: I'm sure I won't. 
WESLEY: Is something wrong? 
SALIA: I've had a great time being with you, Wesley. 
WESLEY: And that makes you sad? 
SALIA: When I was on Klavdia Three, all I could think of was leaving
that isolation. What makes me sad is having to face it again after
seeing what else is possible. 
WESLEY: Is that what awaits you on Daled Four? Isolation? 
SALIA: Yes. 
WESLEY: I thought you were going there to reunite two warring parties. 
SALIA: What else do you know? 
WESLEY: Very little. The ship's computer doesn't have that much on
Daled Four. How will you stop the fighting? 
SALIA: I'm not certain. I only know I will have many responsibilities
when I get there. Your language has no word for the position
I'll hold. In many ways I'll have even less freedom than I did on
Klavdia Three. 
WESLEY: You could stay. 
SALIA: On the Enterprise? 
WESLEY: Why not? 
SALIA: Because I can't. 
(Salia leaves) 
GUINAN: Just because a girl runs out, doesn't mean she doesn't wish you
to follow.

[Corridor]

WESLEY: What is it? What happened? Salia! 
SALIA: Stay away from me! I'm sorry. 
WESLEY: I don't understand. 
SALIA: I can't stay here! I can't have this life! I want it more than
anything, but I can't have it! 
WESLEY: Salia, nothing is impossible. 
SALIA: Not for you. 
WESLEY: There's a way. I know there is! 
(Picard, Anya and a guard come round the corner) 
ANYA: Leave her alone! 
PICARD: Ensign, step away from her. 
ANYA: (to Salia) Come with me.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Energy depletion level? 
COMPUTER: Zero. 
LAFORGE: La Forge to bridge. 
PICARD [OC]: Yes, Lieutenant? 
LAFORGE: I've just completed my final adjustments. Thanks for the time.
You now have warp engines available. 
PICARD [OC]: Very good.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Number One, get us to Daled as quickly as
possible. 
RIKER: Ensign Gibson, take us to warp eight point eight. 
GIBSON: (a strawberry blonde) Warp eight point eight, sir. 
RIKER: Estimated time? 
GIBSON: Three hours, nine minutes. 
PICARD: Ensign Crusher, when you're finished with your duties in
Engineering, report to my Ready Room. 
WESLEY [OC]: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: You have the Bridge, Number One. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: The woman, Anya, is not what she appears to
be. She is an allasomorph. 
WESLEY: A shape shifter? 
PICARD: Yes. She's not only a governess, she's also the girl's
protector. Now, I don't care to interfere in the personal
relationships of those under my command, but in this case. 
WESLEY: You want me to stay away from Salia? 
PICARD: Yes, I do. For the good of the ship and the safety of everyone
on board. 
WESLEY: I will do as you ask.
