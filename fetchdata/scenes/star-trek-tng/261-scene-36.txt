DATA: The next distortion wave will impact in
fourteen seconds. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Matching phases. Prepare to engage the
deflector shield on my mark. 
DATA [OC]: Ten seconds. 
LAFORGE: And mark. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Engage deflector shield. Full power. 
(whumph)

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We lost it. 
[Engineering]

DATA: We were unable to maintain phase match with
the distortion wave, sir. 
PICARD: What went wrong, Mister La Forge? 
LAFORGE [OC]: The speed differential was too high, Captain. 
DATA: Another distortion wave approaching. Impact in twenty six
seconds. 
RIKER: Our hull stress is already critical. We can't handle many more
jolts like that. 
DATA: Captain, I suggest we take the ship to full impulse. If we can
attain sufficient speed, it will lessen the shock when the wave hits. 
PICARD: Helm, full impulse. Head us out of the rift. Mister Worf,
channel all available power to the structural integrity fields. 
WORF: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Stand by deflector shield. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're ready, Captain. 
[Bridge]

DATA: Distortion wave impact in five seconds. 
PICARD: Engage deflector shield, now. 
(and they start paddling hard to catch this wave. Whumph) 
DATA: We are now within the distortion wave. Hull stresses have
exceeded maximum tolerance. 
WORF: Structural integrity fields are failing on decks ten through
sixteen. Switching
to backups. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We're separating from the distortion wave.
I'm attempting to compensate. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: How much longer until we clear the rift? 
DATA: Approximately twelve seconds, sir. Hull stresses one hundred
twenty percent above tolerance. 
WORF: A structural breach is imminent. 
(Enterprise stops shaking and the lights come back up to full) 
DATA: We have cleared the rift, sir. Hull stress has returned to
normal. 
PICARD: Cancel red alert.

Captain's log, stardate 47314.5. We have been
continuing our research, while the Federation Council studies our
preliminary reports on the subspace rift. It now appears certain that
what we've seen here will have repercussions for many years to come.
