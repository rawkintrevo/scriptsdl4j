[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Commander, the shields are frozen. 
RIKER [OC]: Cause? 
LAFORGE: Unknown. 
RIKER [OC]: Lock on tractor beam. 
LAFORGE: Tractor beam is not functioning either. 
[Bridge]

RIKER: What the hell is going on?

[Shuttlecraft]

Q2: Not bad, Q. Not great. But not bad. 
(Dressed in a similar fashion, and stepping through the bulkhead. This
Q looks at his hands as if they are something completely new to him) 
Q: Q! 
Q2: Sacrificing yourself for these humans? Do I detect a little
selfless act? 
Q: You flatter me. I was only trying to put a quick end to a miserable
existence. 
Q2: What a dreadful colour. 
Q: Yeah. What are you doing here? 
Q2: I've been keeping track of you. 
Q: I always felt you were in my corner. 
Q2: Actually, I was the one who got you kicked out. You know, you're
incorrigible, Q. A lost cause. I can't go to a single solar system
without having to apologise for you, and I'm tired of it. 
Q: I wasn't the one who misplaced the entire Deltived asteroid belt. 
Q2: Hey, this isn't about me. I've got better places to be. But
somebody had to keep an eye on you to make sure you still didn't find a
way to cause trouble. Even as a member of this limited species. 
Q: Well, I hope I've been entertaining you. 
Q2: Barely. But I find these humans rather interesting. I'm beginning
to understand what you see in them. After all the
things that you've done, they're still intent on keeping you safe. 
Q: A genetic weakness of the race. 
Q2: And they're still at it. They just tried to beam you up, back,
whatever it is they call it. 
Q: Really? 
Q2: I stopped them. 
Q: Well, if the Calamarains hurry up and finish me off, we can get you
back on your way. 
Q2: Afraid I had to put them on hold too. You see, there's still this
matter of the selfless act. You and I both know that the Calamarain
would have eventually destroyed the Enterprise to get to you. And
that's really why you left, right? 
Q: It was a teeny bit selfless, wasn't it? 
Q2: And there's my problem. See, I can't back to the Continuum and tell
them you committed a selfless act just before the end. If I do there's
going to be questions and explanations for centuries. 
Q: I've learned my lesson, Q. 
Q2: Remember who you're talking to. All knowing, all seeing. Fine, you
got your powers back. Try and stay out of trouble. 
(Q2 vanishes, and Q snaps his fingers. He gets himself a Starfleet
uniform) 
Q: So they wanted to destroy me, did they? 
(The Calamarain are in the palm of his hand) 
Q: If you think I tormented you in the past, my little friends, wait
until you see what I do with you now. 
Q2: Q? 
Q: I was just seeing if you were still watching. 
(Q blows the Calamarain away, gently)
