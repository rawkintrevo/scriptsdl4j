[Nursery]

(there's sunshine and foliage outside the windows,
toys in the room, and a man in a movie-style uniform) 
IAN: Deanna. 
TROI: Daddy? 
IAN: Look at you. You've become a beautiful woman 
TROI: Don't do this. 
IAN: I'm sorry I had to go away when you were so little. I didn't want
to. 
TROI: You're not my father. You're part of my mother's mind. What is
this place? 
IAN: This is our house near Lake El'nar on Betazed. We used to live
here. Deanna, let's not waste this chance. I want to hear everything
about you. 
TROI: Did I live here? 
IAN: For a while when you were a baby. You were such a beautiful baby.
Your mother and I loved you so much. 
TROI: I don't remember these toys. 
IAN: I bet you don't remember me singing you to sleep at night either,
but I did. 
TROI: I do remember. I always felt safe when you sang to me. 
IAN: There was one song you always asked me to sing. You couldn't fall
asleep unless you heard it. 
TROI: Down in the valley. 
IAN: Yes. (sings) Down in the valley, valley so low. Hang your head
over, hear the wind blow. 
TROI: No, you're just trying to keep me here. Keep me from finding
something. 
IAN: Your mother doesn't want to see you, Deanna. 
TROI: I have to help her. 
IAN: If you want to help her, leave. Let her have peace. 
TROI: She called out to me. She does want me to help. 
IAN: Stay with me, just a little while. Deanna, it's been so long.
We'll never have this chance again. 
TROI: Goodbye, Daddy.

[Corridor]

(the sound of water again, then Hedril as a
Betazoid child) 
TROI: Hedril. 
(Lwaxana comes around the corner) 
TROI: Mother. 
LWAXANA: Get away from her!

[Sickbay]

TROI: No!
