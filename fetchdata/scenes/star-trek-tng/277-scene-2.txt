(Picard is bearded and working outside on a grape

their supports.) 
LAFORGE: Captain Picard to the Bridge! Captain, we've got a problem
with the warp core, or the phase inducers, or some other damn thing. 
PICARD: Geordi. 
(They embrace. Geordi has blue eyes and grey in his hair) 
LAFORGE: Hello, Captain or should I call you Ambassador? 
PICARD: Oh, I haven't been called that for some time either. 
LAFORGE: How about Mister Picard? 
PICARD: How about Jean-Luc? 
LAFORGE: I don't think I could get used to that. 
PICARD: Good Lord, Geordi. Well, how long has it been? 
LAFORGE: Nine years. 
PICARD: No, no, no. Since you last called me Captain, since we were all
together on the Enterprise? 
LAFORGE: Close to twenty five years. 
PICARD: Twenty five years. Well, time has been good to you. 
LAFORGE: IA little too good to me in some places. Can I give you a hand
here? 
PICARD: Oh, well, I'm just tying up some vines. 
LAFORGE: You've got leaf miners. You might want to use a bacillus
spray. My wife is quite a gardener. I've picked up a little bit of it. 
PICARD: How is Leah? 
LAFORGE: Just wonderful. Busy as ever. She's just been made director of
the Daystrom Institute. 
PICARD: What about the little ones, Brett, Alandra and er? 
LAFORGE: Sidney. 
PICARD: Sidney. 
LAFORGE: Well, they're not so little any more. Brett is applying to
Starfleet Academy next year. 
PICARD: So what brings you here? 
LAFORGE: Oh I just thought I'd stop by. Been thinking about the old
days on the Enterprise. I was in the neighbourhood. 
PICARD: Geordi, you don't make the trip from Rigel Three to Earth just
to drop by. 
LAFORGE: No. 
PICARD: So, you've heard? 
LAFORGE: Leah's got a few friends at Starfleet Medical. Word gets
around. 
PICARD: I'm not an invalid. Irumodic Syndrome can take years to run its
course. 
LAFORGE: I know. Once I heard, well, I just wanted to stop by just the
same. 
PICARD: Well now that you're here, you can help me carry those tools.
Well, my cooking may not be up to Leah's
standards, but I can still make a decent cup of tea. Oh, I read your
last novel. I thought that the protagonist a little too flamboyant, but
for the rest I
