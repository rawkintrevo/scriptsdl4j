[Picard's quarters]

(this area of space is strewn with rocky debris) 
PICARD: As a matter of fact, I never met Will until he reported on
board at Farpoint Station. 
PRESSMAN: You chose your first officer without ever meeting him? 
PICARD: I was looking through the records of about fifty candidates and
Will's was much like all the others, filled with lots of dry statistics
and glowing letters of recommendation that tell you nothing. I was
about to put it aside and look at another file and then something
caught my eye. There was an incident on Altair Three when Will was
First Officer of the Hood. He refused to let Captain DeSoto beam down
during a crisis. He disobeyed a direct order and he risked a general
court martial because he thought he was right. When I read that, I knew
that I had found my Number One. 
PRESSMAN: You wanted someone with a history of disobedience? 
PICARD: I wanted someone who would stand up to me. Someone who was more
concerned with the safety of the ship and accomplishing the mission
than with how something looked on his record. To me, that's one of the
marks of a good officer. 
PRESSMAN: Frankly, I've always felt it was more important for an
officer to trust his captain's judgment. In a crisis, there's no time
for explanations. Orders have to be obeyed without question or lives
may be lost. 
PICARD: I am aware of that, Admiral. 
PRESSMAN: Of course you are. I guess this mission has brought up some
old ghosts for me. You know what it's like to lose a ship. You're
always wondering if there was something else you should have done,
something you missed. 
PICARD: Admiral, the record regarding the loss of the Pegasus is a bit
vague from the moment just before you abandoned ship. Is there anything
that you can add to the official account? 
PRESSMAN: I'm afraid not. But I can tell you this. Twelve years ago, I
needed an officer that I could count on in a crisis. Someone who would
support and obey my decisions without question. Someone who was willing
to trust my judgment. And that someone was Will Riker. Without his
loyalty, none of us would have survived.
