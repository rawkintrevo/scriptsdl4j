[Ten Forward]

(Deanna and Beverly go to Ro's table) 
TROI: Do you mind if we join you? 
RO: Yes. 
(Deanna and Beverly move on) 
LAFORGE: (at the bar) I'll tell you one thing. If I find myself on an
away team with Ensign Ro, I won't turn my back on her. 
GUINAN: Perhaps the Captain thought she'd be valuable on the mission? 
LAFORGE: That was orders. Had to be. She doesn't belong here. She
doesn't even belong in the uniform, as far as I'm concerned. 
GUINAN: Really? 
LAFORGE: Really. 
GUINAN: Sounds like someone I'd like to know. Excuse me. 
(Guinan goes to Ro's table and sits down) 
GUINAN: Am I disturbing you? 
RO: Yes. 
GUINAN: Good. You look like someone who wants to be disturbed. 
RO: I'd rather be alone. 
GUINAN: Oh, no you wouldn't. 
RO: I beg your pardon? 
GUINAN: If you wanted to be alone, you would've stayed in your
quarters. The only reason to come here is to be amongst people. 
RO: Who are you? 
GUINAN: My name is Guinan. I tend bar, and I listen. 
RO: Heard anything interesting? 
GUINAN: Everyone's talking about you. 
RO: Heard anything interesting? 
GUINAN: Mmm hmm. 
RO: Well, it's all true. 
GUINAN: I believe truth is in the eye of the beholder. 
RO: Isn't that supposed to be beauty? 
GUINAN: Truth, beauty. It works for a lot of things. They say you never
told the true story about Galon Two. They also say you didn't defend
yourself at your court martial. 
RO: What was to defend? I didn't follow orders. Eight members of the
away team died. 
GUINAN: Your fault? 
RO: Yeah, my fault. 
GUINAN: So you sit alone in crowded rooms staring at your drink. I
think you enjoy it. 
RO: I enjoy it? 
GUINAN: You work so hard at torturing yourself, I can only think you
must enjoy it. 
RO: Who are you? 
GUINAN: I told you. I'm Guinan. I tend bar, and I listen. 
RO: You're not like any bartender I ever met before. 
GUINAN: And you're not like any Starfleet officer I've ever met before,
but that sounds like the beginning of a very interesting friendship. 
RO: I don't stay anywhere long enough to make friends. 
GUINAN: Too late. You just did. Excuse me. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Bridge to Ensign Ro. 
RO: Go ahead. 
CREWWOMAN [OC]: Subspace communication coming in for you, Ensign. 
RO: Thank you.

[Ro's quarters]

RO: Computer, direct subspace transmission to
monitor. 
KENNELLY [on monitor]: Your report, Ensign. 
RO: Everything is going exactly as you predicted, Admiral. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Any indications of weapons or vessels
beneath the surface? 
RIKER: The composition of the moon's crust is blocking the sensors. 
PICARD: Which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base of
operations.
