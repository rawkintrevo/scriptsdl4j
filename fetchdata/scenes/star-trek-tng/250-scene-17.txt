TROI WORF PICARD RIKER CREWWOMAN CRUSHER DATA

[Ready room]

PICARD: Come. 
RIKER: You wanted to see me, sir? 
PICARD: Yes, Number One. Come in. 
PICARD: Lieutenant Riker has been to see me to talk about the away
mission. He believes that the only way to retrieve the database is by
directly accessing the main core underneath the station. 
RIKER: The seismic activity makes those caverns very unstable. In my
opinion, it's too risky. 
PICARD: He said that he was down there recently. He seemed confident
that it could be done safely. 
RIKER: There's a good chance we will be able to retrieve the database
from one of the consoles inside the station. 
PICARD: But if it doesn't work, we won't have another chance for eight
years. 
RIKER: Lieutenant Riker's plan is more dangerous, but it does have a
better chance of succeeding. 
PICARD: Given the importance of the data, I think that it's worth the
risk. 
RIKER: I'll look over the schematics and I'll draw up a mission plan. 
PICARD: I'm sure that Lieutenant Riker will be happy to help you with
that. 
RIKER: I'll talk to him.

[Engineering]

CREWWOMAN: (to Riker 2) Sir. 
RIKER: Lieutenant. 
RIKER 2: Sir. 
RIKER: I just met with the Captain about your mission recommendation. I
would appreciate it if next time you came to me first. 
RIKER 2: I tried talking to you yesterday on the station. You wouldn't
hear me out. 
RIKER: I heard you, Lieutenant. I rejected your plan. 
RIKER 2: May I ask what the Captain decided? 
RIKER: The Captain has decided to go with your recommendation, but
that's not the point. 
RIKER 2: Isn't it? 
RIKER: If you think I'm coming down on you because the Captain
overruled me, think again. I happen to disagree with his decision, but
he is my commanding officer and I follow his orders. Just so there's no
confusion, I am your commanding officer and I expect you to do the
same. If you can't, there's no place for you on my away team. 
RIKER 2: Yes, sir. 
RIKER: There will be a meeting in the Observation lounge at fourteen
hundred hours to draw up a mission plan.

[Gymnasium]

(Beverly and Deanna are doing the mok'bara
exercises) 
TROI: We stayed in Ten Forward talking for hours. 
CRUSHER: Then what happened? 
TROI: He walked me to my quarters. 
CRUSHER: Then what happened? 
TROI: Beverly! 
CRUSHER: I'm just asking. 
TROI: You know it's been over between Will and me for a long time. 
CRUSHER: He's not Will. He is Will but, you know what I mean. 
TROI: It's really hard for me to separate my feelings for them. 
CRUSHER: Deanna, just because things turned out the way they did
between you and Commander Riker, doesn't mean you shouldn't let things
between you and Lieutenant Riker take their own course. 
TROI: I knew you'd encourage me. 
CRUSHER: I thought that's that why you brought it up. 
(they resume the forms, as Lt. Riker enters) 
CRUSHER: Well, I think I'll call it a day. 
TROI: (hisses) Beverly. 
(Riker limbers up) 
CRUSHER: Bye. 
RIKER 2: Some form of tai chi chuan? 
TROI: Klingon exercises, actually. Lieutenant Worf teaches a class. 
RIKER 2: The forms are very similar. Do that move again. 
(she does, and he copies) 
TROI: You just did the KoH-man-ara. 
RIKER 2: Tai chi chuan. It's called the crane block. Now let's try
something else. 
(he does a move that reaches out to her, she takes the arm, bends it
back and rolls him onto his back) 
RIKER 2: What was that called? Mister Worf's a very good teacher. 
(and now she has him on the floor, lips connect in a prelude to
horizontal jogging) 
[Ten Forward]

TROI: Hello, Will. 
RIKER: If you want to be with him, you don't have to ask my permission.
It's the look in your eyes. I recognise it. You used to have it for me.

TROI: We've both had relationships with other people. This is
different. I didn't know how you'd feel about it. 
RIKER: Flattered, sort of. 
TROI: This must be very strange for you. 
RIKER: Ever since he came on board, I find myself thinking about the
choice you and I made. 
TROI: Me too. 
RIKER: Do me a favour. Be careful. 
TROI: Will, I know you and he have had some problems. 
RIKER: That's not what I'm talking about. If he had gotten off the
planet instead of me, don't you think he would have made the same
choices that I made? I just don't want you to be hurt again.

[Cmdr Riker's quarters]

WORF: Two pair. 
RIKER: Full boat, kings over. I'd like to thank you both for your very
generous contributions. 
(doorbell) 
RIKER: Come in. 
RIKER 2: I thought you'd be alone. Excuse me. 
RIKER: Why don't you join us? 
(the two Rikers are sitting opposite each other) 
DATA: The game is five card draw, no limit. Ante, please. 
(Data deals) 
DATA: Lieutenant? 
RIKER 2: Three. please. 
DATA: Mister Worf? 
WORF: Four. 
DATA: Commander. 
RIKER: I'll play these. 
DATA: Dealer takes two. You control the bet, Lieutenant. 
RIKER 2: Fifty. 
WORF: Fold. 
RIKER: Here's your fifty. And ten more. 
RIKER 2: You didn't take any cards. You must be holding something. Why
not make it a little sweeter? 
RIKER: No, thanks. 
RIKER 2: Playing it safe? 
RIKER: You in? 
DATA: I will call. 
RIKER 2: Here's your ten, and it will cost you another one hundred. 
RIKER: I've practised in the mirror too long to be fooled by that face.
You're bluffing. Here's your hundred and twenty more. 
DATA: Dealer folds. 
RIKER 2: I thought if one thing were clear by now, it's that you and I
play things a little differently. 
RIKER: Why don't we wait and see who comes out on top. 
RIKER 2: I thought you were willing to settle for second. Commander. 
RIKER: I've never settled for anything in my life. I know what I want,
I know what I've got, and you'd be lucky to do as well. Lieutenant. 
RIKER 2: Here's your twenty. Three hundred more. 
RIKER: Now I know you're bluffing. 
RIKER 2: Are you in or not? 
RIKER: Why don't we get this over with? I'll call your three, and I'll
raise you anything you've got left. Well? 
RIKER 2: Take it. You always had the better hand, in everything.
