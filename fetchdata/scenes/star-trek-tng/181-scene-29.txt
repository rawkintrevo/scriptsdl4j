[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(Worf and Alexander enter to find a broken table
and K'Ehleyr lying across a chair. There is blood) 
WORF: Medical emergency, deck eight, room one four two! 
(Worf takes K'Ehleyr in his arms. She is very badly injured and can
barely whisper) 
WORF: Gowron? 
K'EHLEYR: No. 
WORF: Duras! 
K'EHLEYR: Alexander. 
(She puts Alexander's hand into Worf's, then dies) 
WORF: K'Ehleyr. K'Ehleyr! 
(He does the death roar, which frightens Alexander, then lays her on
the floor) 
WORF: You have never seen death. Then look. And always remember. 
(Crusher arrives with an assistant) 
WORF: Stay with the doctor. 
CRUSHER: Worf, when did you 
(But he has already left) 
[Worf's quarters]

(Worf removes his baldric, takes the bat'leth from
the wall. As an afterthought, he takes off his
comm. badge too)

[K'Ehleyr's quarters]

(K'Ehleyr's body is being removed) 
CRUSHER: Multiple stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Too much trauma
to the internal organs. There wasn't time enough to take her into
stasis. 
PICARD: Where's Worf? 
CRUSHER: I don't know. He disappeared just after I arrived. 
RIKER: Riker to Lieutenant Worf. Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf. 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf is not aboard the Enterprise. 
PICARD: Where is he? 
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Worf transported to the Klingon ship Vorn at
seventeen thirty hours. 
RIKER: On my way.

[Duras' quarters]

WORF: Duras. 
DURAS: What is that doing here? 
KLINGON: He has claimed the right of vengeance. 
DURAS: You have no rights here, traitor! 
WORF: K'Ehleyr was my mate. 
(Duras takes a sword)
