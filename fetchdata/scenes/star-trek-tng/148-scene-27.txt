RIKER LIATOR RIVAN TROI PULASKI MINUET

[The Icarus Factor - Troi's office]

RIKER: I didn't want to leave without saying
goodbye. 
TROI: I don't like goodbyes. How about, until next time. 
RIKER: How about, until next time. 
TROI: It's been a pleasure working with you, Commander. 
RIKER: The feeling is mutual, Counsellor. 
TROI: I'm supposed to know how everyone feels, but I can't read you
right now. 
RIKER: Perhaps your own feelings are getting in the way. 
TROI: My job is to help others sort out their emotions. My own feelings
are beside the point. 
RIKER: Not to me. Our feelings are what make us all human. 
TROI: Are you feeling sad? 
RIKER: Yes, I am. 
TROI: So am I. 
[Sickbay]

TROI: He's relaxed. Experiencing feelings of warmth
and friendship. 
PULASKI: He's reliving memories. It's a natural side effect of neural
stimulation. Look at this. The organisms' metabolism has changed. I
wonder if the stimulation is affecting them somehow. I'm going to
refocus the impulse pattern on the interpretative cortex. 
TROI: To intensify his memories? 
PULASKI: Exactly. We'll see if that has an effect on the microbes. 
[Justice - Edo Council Chambers]

RIVAN: Everyone! We've brought the visitors. 
LIATOR: Please, enjoy what we have.

RIKER: Gentlemen, if this is what you call
enhancement, you've got a gift for understatement. What's a knockout
like you doing in a computer-generated joint like this? 
MINUET: Waiting for you. 
RIKER: Waiting for me? You can't be serious? 
MINUET: Oh yes, Will. I've never been more serious in my life. 
[Sickbay]

PULASKI: Something wrong? 
TROI: No, it's just that Commander Riker's emotions are rather
passionate. 
PULASKI: As in erotic? 
TROI: Very much so.

MINUET: A dream? Is that what this is? Is that what
I am? 
RIKER: I know you are a computer-generated image, but your smell, your
touch, the way you feel. Even the things you say and think seem so
real. 
MINUET: Thank you. 
RIKER: How far can this relationship go? I mean, how real are you? 
MINUET: As real as you need me to be.
