RIKER KENNELLY WORF PICARD TROI BAJORAN CHIEF COMPUTER COLLINS RO DATA ORTA

[Ro's quarters]

RO: Computer, direct subspace transmission to
monitor. 
KENNELLY [on monitor]: Your report, Ensign. 
RO: Everything is going exactly as you predicted, Admiral. 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Any indications of weapons or vessels
beneath the surface? 
RIKER: The composition of the moon's crust is blocking the sensors. 
PICARD: Which is very likely why they chose this moon for their base of
operations. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: We're on a timetable here. Where's Ro? 
PICARD: Captain Picard to Ensign Ro. 
DATA: Computer, locate Ensign Ro. 
COMPUTER: Ensign Ro is not on board the Enterprise. 
WORF: Check the transport log. 
COLLINS: She beamed down almost six hours ago, sir. 
PICARD: Any activity at the meeting site? 
CHIEF: No, sir. They didn't show up. 
RIKER: What the hell is going on? 
PICARD: Prepare to transport us to the same location Ensign Ro beamed
to. Mister Worf, phasers. 
[Moon caves]

DATA: I am picking up molecular displacement
traces. That suggests movement through this area during the last ten
hours. 
PICARD: See if we can determine their direction. Standard search
pattern. 
WORF: Maintain tricorder security link. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, you come with me. 
TROI: Data, I'm picking up energy fluctuations over here. Troi to
Picard. Captain, acknowledge. 
DATA: Data to Picard. Data to Worf. 
(Data and Troi go off in the same direction as Worf and Picard. They
run into Bajorans) 
BAJORAN: Hold it. 
(Data drops his phaser) 
(Ro enters with a man who has his face half covered with a scarf. He
speaks with a metallic voice) 
ORTA: Captain Picard, I am Orta. Please forgive my appearance.
Unfortunately, some years ago, as a guest of the Cardassians, my face
was mutilated. My vocal cords were cut. 
PICARD: It was not necessary to abduct us. 
ORTA: I am sorry, but after speaking with Ro Laren, I decided that it
was. 
PICARD: Then she has done us both a disservice. I am committed to
peace. 
ORTA: I am not at all interested in peace. And I am not convinced you
are, either. 
RO: Captain, I did not come here to undermine this mission. 
PICARD: Whatever your motives, you've already done enough to damage
these negotiations. 
RO: I came here to convince these people to listen to you. I didn't
want this to end in bloodshed. 
PICARD: There will be no bloodshed. 
RO: You don't know all the facts, sir. 
PICARD: Then perhaps you would share them with me, Ensign. 
ORTA: All is not what it seems to be, Captain. Perhaps someone is using
you to get to me. Perhaps you are a victim of this deception as well. I
do not know. 
PICARD: Deception? 
ORTA: Your mission was to seek out the Bajoran terrorists who destroyed
the Federation settlement on Solarion Four. 
PICARD: Yes. 
ORTA: As I have informed Ro Laren, it was not the Bajora.
