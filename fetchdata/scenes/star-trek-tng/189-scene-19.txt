[Riker's hospital room]

KROLA: You have lied since the moment of your
capture and I believe you are lying now, Commander. 
RIKER: No. We're here on a mission of peace. 
KROLA: Such noble creatures. Why do peaceful people develop such lethal
weapons? Or do you still insist it's just a toy? 
(Krola fires the phaser at an instrument stand) 
KROLA: An interesting toy, to be sure. 
RIKER: It's only used for defence. 
KROLA: Perhaps, like many conquerors, you believe your goals to be
benevolent. I cannot. For however you would describe your intentions,
you still represent the end to my way of life. I cannot permit that to
occur. Eventually, Durken would choose to welcome your people with arms
open and eyes closed. I must force him down another path. 
(he puts the phaser in Riker's hand) 
KROLA: When they find us, I will be dead, killed by your weapon. The
lines will be drawn. A peaceful accord will no longer be an option. 
RIKER: No. 
KROLA: For my people. 
(and the weapon goes off) 
(Tava and Nilrem enter) 
TAVA: What happened? 
NILREM: He shot him. The alien shot Krola. 
(Tava gets on the emergency phone) 
TAVA: Get me three octares of adrulmine, high frequency EM charge unit
now! 
NILREM: I have a circulation pattern. It's very weak. We have to get
him on vital buffers right now 
(Crusher, Worf and a medic beam in)
CRUSHER: I'm a physician, don't be frightened. I need to know what
happened. Are you doctors? 
TAVA: Yes. He shot him. 
NILREM: With that thing. 
CRUSHER: Crusher to Picard. 
PICARD [OC]: Go ahead, Doctor. 
CRUSHER: Commander Riker is near death. 
[Durken's office]

CRUSHER [OC]: But there's still some brain
activity. I need to get him back to the ship. 
PICARD: Acknowledged. 
CRUSHER [OC]: And there's a Malconian male with a phaser wound in his
upper chest. I need to get him back as well. 
PICARD: We'll meet you on the Enterprise. Picard out.
