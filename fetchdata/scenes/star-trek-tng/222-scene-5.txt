ISABELLA LAFORGE CLARA SUTTER OGAWA CRUSHER DATA

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: And then after dinner, then what? 
OGAWA: We went to the holodeck and took a walk on the Champs Elysees. 
CRUSHER: The neural scanner still seems to be a bit off. Let's check
the sensor calibrations. 
OGAWA: I'll run a diagnostic. 
(the firefly is there) 
CRUSHER: And? 
OGAWA: And? 
CRUSHER: After Paris? 
OGAWA: He has shore leave next month. He asked me to go to Risa with
him. 
CRUSHER: No problem. Nurse McClukidge can cover for you. 
OGAWA: I don't think I'm going, Doctor. I hear it's a very uninhibited
atmosphere. Personally, I don't think I'm ready for that kind of fun. 
CRUSHER: Try to talk him into Tavena Minor. They have a cruise down the
Jokri River. The iridescent currents are beautiful.

[Arboretum]

(the firefly is exploring the orchids) 
CLARA: See, Isabella? You have to push your finger into the soil as far
as it can go. I'm making a hole for the seeds. Now they need to be
watered. But the baby seeds are very small, so we mustn't give them too
much to drink. 
(the firefly passes through Clara's head, then a second voice joins in
with Clara's humming) 
CLARA: Hello? Is anybody there? 
ISABELLA: Hello. 
CLARA: Isabella? 
ISABELLA: Hello, Clara. 
(she's blonde, wearing a blue dress and a sour, sulky expression) 
CLARA: Isabella, how come I can see you? 
ISABELLA: Is something wrong with the way I look? 
CLARA: No. I've just never seen you before. Not for real. 
ISABELLA: Well, now you can see me for real. Doesn't that make you
happy? 
CLARA: Yes, it's wonderful. 
ISABELLA: Can we go now? 
CLARA: We'd better finish planting the seeds first. 
ISABELLA: I'm tired of planting. Let's do something else. 
CLARA: Like what? 
ISABELLA: Like, I would really like to explore the ship. 
CLARA: We'd better finish planting first. I promised Keiko. 
ISABELLA: We can finish later. Let's go look around. 
CLARA: I'd better ask my daddy. 
ISABELLA: Your daddy won't mind. We can tell him later. Come on.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: So what are we going to name this nebula?
FGC forty seven just doesn't have the proper ring to it. 
SUTTER: Why don't we call it Sutter's Cloud? 
DATA: The rotational period of the neutron star is one point three five
seconds. 
LAFORGE: That's a bit on the long side. Sutter, let's see if you can
get a reading on the particle flux. 
SUTTER: Aye, sir. 
LAFORGE: I was thinking about something more along the lines of the La
Forge Nebula. It's got sort of a majestic sound, don't you think? 
DATA: Given the selections, I prefer FGC four seven. 
(the ship shakes) 
SUTTER: What was that? 
LAFORGE: It felt like we hit something. 
DATA: Shields have registered an impact, however sensors show nothing
in the vicinity.
