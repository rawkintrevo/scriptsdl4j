CASTILLO: I'm showing phaser banks up to seventy
percent efficiency. We've got an hour left. Let's see if we can get
them up to ninety. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Aye, sir. 
CASTILLO: Parker, you've got Ops. Fredericks, take the conn. 
TASHA: I'll handle Tactical. Lieutenant Tasha Yar reporting for duty,
sir. 
CASTILLO: You're not part of my crew. 
TASHA: I am now. Captain Picard approved my request for transfer. 
CASTILLO: This isn't a joke, Tasha. We're going back in the rift, into
battle. We're not coming back. 
TASHA: I know the mission. These are my orders, Lieutenant. 
CASTILLO: But I don't want you here. 
TASHA: You need me here. Show me someone on your crew who can do the
job better than I can. 
CASTILLO: Welcome aboard. Take your station, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Aye, sir.
