TROI LAFORGE WORF PICARD RIKER HARITATH SHELIAK GOSHEVEN DATA ARDRIAN KENTOR

[Bridge]

PICARD: Fifteen thousand! 
RIKER: Three days, no transporters. We'll never get them out in time. 
PICARD: Shuttles? 
WORF: Loading all the Enterprise shuttlecraft to capacity, evacuation
will take four weeks, four days. 
PICARD: We need more time. Mister Data, prepare the colonists for an
evacuation. 
DATA [OC]: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: Get me the Sheliak. 
WORF: Their home world is quite distant, Captain. This will take some
time.

[Main square]

(Plastered walls, arcades, insects chirping, a
waterfall that comes all the way from the mountain into a communal
pool) 
HARITATH: Gosheven, look what's come. 
DATA: Lieutenant Commander Data of the Starship Enterprise. 
KENTOR: He's an android. 
GOSHEVEN: So he is. Well, now that you're here, what do you want? 
DATA: My mission is to prepare this colony for evacuation. 
GOSHEVEN: Why? 
DATA: Because this planet belongs to the Sheliak. 
GOSHEVEN: And who is this Sheliak? 
DATA: The term is plural. The Sheliak are a non-humanoid, intelligent
life form, classification R3. 
GOSHEVEN: Well, this colony's been here over ninety years. We've never
seen a Sheliak. I'd say that makes Tau Cygna Five our planet. 
DATA: The original destination of the Artemis was Septimus Minor. 
GOSHEVEN: The guidance system on the Artemis failed. Took them off
course. Far off course. Our ancestors were lucky to find any place to
land. 
HARITATH: And when they did, the radiation started killing them. 
GOSHEVEN: Hyperonic radiation took the lives of a third of the
colonists before they learned they could adapt to it. 
KENTOR: But our colony survived and prospered. 
GOSHEVEN: Look around. We have brought water to the desert, built a
community. 
DATA: Your accomplishments are truly remarkable. Yet the Sheliak and
the Federation have a treaty which clearly makes this planet Sheliak
domain. 
GOSHEVEN: Then change the treaty. 
DATA: That may not be possible. The Sheliak wish to colonise this
planet, and are unwilling to share it with humans. If you are still
here when the Sheliak colony ship arrives, they will eradicate you. 
HARITATH: They'd kill all of us? 
DATA: They have little regard for human life. Thus, the most sensible
course is to prepare a contingency plan for the evacuation of your
people. 
GOSHEVEN: We're not evacuating. 
DATA: Perhaps I have not made myself clear. 
GOSHEVEN: Yes, you have. Let me be equally clear. There's going to be
no evacuation. You've delivered your message, so go back to your ship.
I have work to do. 
(Gosheven goes back to his discussion and an object is thrown at Data.
He catches it) 
ARD'RIAN: Nice catch. Wonderful reflexes. Sorry to test you like that,
but I was curious. 
(It is a young woman in breeches and braces) 
GOSHEVEN: Found a new toy, have we, Ardi? 
ARD'RIAN: Toy? This is the most incredible android I've ever seen. 
DATA: Have you seen many? 
ARD'RIAN: Actually, no. You're the first. 
GOSHEVEN: Only you would get this excited over a walking calculator. 
ARD'RIAN: Cybernetic intelligence fascinates me. Are your neural
pathways duotronic? 
DATA: No, positronic. 
ARD'RIAN: I didn't know that was possible! What's your memory capacity?
How many operations per second? I have a million questions. 
DATA: I'm afraid I have no time to answer a million questions. I have a
mission to accomplish. I need to know more about your people, and
Gosheven seems unwilling to talk to me further. 
ARD'RIAN: I'm Ard'rian McKenzie. Perhaps I can help you.

[Observation lounge]

(Le Forge and O'Brien enter) 
RIKER: Gentlemen, we're giving you an assignment. One thing we don't
want to hear is that it is impossible. 
PICARD: I need the transporters to function despite the hyperonic
radiation. 
LAFORGE: Yeah, but that's im. Yes, sir. 
(La Forge and O'Brien leave) 
RIKER: Even if we get the Sheliak to talk, they're not likely to be
accommodating. 
TROI: Captain, when the treaty was first negotiated the Federation sent
three hundred and seventy two legal experts. What do we have? 
PICARD: Thee and me?

[Bridge]

WORF: No response. 
PICARD: Try them again. Boost the signal strength. 
WORF: Sheliak Corporate. This is the starship Enterprise. Respond
please. 
(A vaguely humanoid blob appears, looking like lumps of mud) 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Conversation is neither required nor desired. 
PICARD: Conversation is necessary if we are to find a solution to our
mutual problem. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Our involvement in Federation illegality is
not indicated. 
PICARD: Both parties are involved, sir. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Remove the humans from the Tau Cygna system.
Three Earth days remain. 
PICARD: Let us negotiate in good faith. 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Negotiate to what purpose? The treaty is
signed. 
PICARD: There is a thriving colony on that planet. Rather than uproot
these people, may I offer a compromise? 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: Denied. 
PICARD: Why? 
SHELIAK [on viewscreen]: The law is paramount. We are entitled. 
PICARD: This is not a law. It is a treaty. It is designed to smooth
relations between peoples. Not to act as a strait 
(Transmission ends) 
PICARD: Jacket.
