[Antican quarters]

(The Anticans have long white eyebrows, and white
facial hair, and have sharp teeth like a mongoose) 
TASHA: Sorry to call you, sir. Not strictly security. It's about the
dietary requirements of the Antican delegates. 
RIKER: I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha. 
TASHA: So did we, sir. Their live animals were beamed aboard. We were
going to preserve the meat for them, but they say we must bring it to
them alive. 
RIKER: Then do so. Lieutenant Yar was confused. We no longer enslave
animals for food purposes. 
ANTICAN: But we have seen humans eat meat. 
RIKER: You've seen something as fresh and tasty as meat, but
inorganically materialised out of patterns used by our transporters. 
ANTICAN: This is sickening. It's barbaric.

[Sickbay]

(Work is on a bed, with Beverly tending to him,
when blue energy comes out of him, up her arms. She sags, then Troi
enters) 
TROI: He's reading normal now. How did you manage that? 
CRUSHER: Yes. Normal. 
TROI: Are you all right? 
CRUSHER: Yes, perfectly. Both of us. Quite normal now. 
(Worf wakes suddenly) 
WORF: What? Where am I? 
TROI: Don't you remember? You were in the sensor maintenance room. 
WORF: I remember monitoring the sensor console. What am I doing here? 
TROI: That's a story the Doctor will tell you. 
(But Crusher walks out)

[Bridge]

(At a rear science station) 
PICARD: Obviously you feel it's something we should look at more
carefully. 
DATA: A mystery is only a mystery as long as it remains uninvestigated,
sir. 
PICARD: I love a mystery, Data, but this one will have to to wait until
we deliver the delegates to their peace conference on Parliament. Time
and tide, Lieutenant La Forge. Go to warp eight. 
LAFORGE: Warp eight, sir.
