[Duras' home]

B'ETOR: The Romulan convoy is late. We need those
supplies. 
SELA: (formerly known as Woman) Gowron has suffered another loss in the
Mempa system. His forces will not threaten you in that region for some
time. 
B'ETOR: But if Gowron 
SELA: The convoy will arrive in due course. 
(Lursa enters) 
LURSA: The Federation fleet has left Starbase two thirty four. They've
set course for Klingon territory. 
MOVAR: How many? 
LURSA: At least twenty starships. 
SELA: Who's commanding this fleet? 
LURSA: Picard. 
TORAL: What does it mean? Is the Federation going to enter the war?
Should we attack them before they get here? 
SELA: Silence the child, or send him away. Movar, I want you to return
to Romulus immediately. Have all available ships
rendezvous at these coordinates in two days. 
MOVAR: Yes, Commander. 
LURSA: Twenty ships aren't enough to wage a war. Starfleet must be
bluffing. 
SELA: Perhaps. 
[Great Hall]

KURN: Our forces in the Mempa sector are now in
full retreat. They will need to regroup near Beta Lankal. 
GOWRON: We destroyed their supply bases in that sector three weeks ago.
How can they continue to fight? 
KURN: They must be getting help. 
KULGE: Maybe they have better leaders. I say you have failed as our
leader, Gowron. 
(and he draws his dagger) 
WORF: There is no time for this! We must make plans before those forces
reach Beta Lankal! How can we oppose the Duras when
we continue to fight among ourselves? 
KURN: Gowron must answer a challenge to his authority. 
WORF: Stop it! Do we to fall upon ourselves like a pack of Ferengi? The
enemy is the Duras. We are at war! 
(Worf steps between the fighters and Gowron takes the opportunity to
kill Kulge) 
GOWRON: Now the war can continue.
