thrill walks time interstellar 1701d detected earth signs changing

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Not unless another asteroid decides to pay
a call on Penthara, sir. 
DATA: The odds of that occurring, Captain, are extremely unlikely,
given the time frame. 
PICARD [OC]: Thank you, Mister Data.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign, bring the ship about. Let's take a
look at Mister Worf's distortion. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Mister Worf's what? 
PICARD: The Lieutenant's sensors detected a temporal distortion almost
in our current course. There's a small object back there that wasn't
there a few moments ago. 
WORF: The object is fifty kilometres ahead, sir. 
PICARD: Full stop, Ensign. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
PICARD: On screen. 
RIKER: Dimensions, Worf? 
WORF: Approximately five metres in length, sir. 
PICARD: Lifesigns? 
WORF: No signs of any kind. Our sensors do not penetrate the hull. 
PICARD: Try hailing it. 
WORF: That's odd. 
RIKER: What's odd? 
WORF: We've received a response, sir, but 
PICARD: Yes, Mister Worf? 
WORF: They want you to move over, sir. 
PICARD: Reply that the Enterprise isn't going anywhere, Lieutenant. 
WORF: Not the Enterprise, Captain. You. 
PICARD: What are you trying to tell me? 
(and as Picard walks back towards Worf a figure appears where he was
standing)

RASMUSSEN: Oops. Excuse me, Captain, but you were standing right where
I needed to be. 
PICARD: Who are you? 
RASMUSSEN: Rasmussen's the name, sir. Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
Ah, this is wonderful. Actually, quite a bit larger than I thought. 
PICARD: Really? 
RASMUSSEN: Where I come from, every historian knows the bridge of old
1701D. 
PICARD: Where exactly do you come from? 
RASMUSSEN: Why, Earth. Late twenty sixth century Earth, to be exact.
I've travelled back nearly three hundred years just to find you.

[Ready room]

(the lanky man is peering at a book on a stand -
Shakespeare I presume) 
PICARD: Exactly what kind of historian are you? 
RASMUSSEN: My focus is on the twenty second through the twenty fourth
centuries. Early interstellar history. You know, it was always believed
this was on your desk, not here. Fascinating. Don't move it on my
account. 
PICARD: You can't expect me to believe that the layout of my ready room
can possibly be of interest to future historians. 
RASMUSSEN: No less so than your legendary modesty, Captain. If I could
describe to you what a thrill it is to be here. (points at painting)
This is the original. 
PICARD: You flatter me Professor, but I can't help but wonder what
could possibly have caused you to select me as the subject of your
study. Even in this decade, there are far wiser and more experienced
humans in and out of Starfleet. 
RASMUSSEN: I'd love to tell you, Picard. I really would, but try and
imagine what a young Caesar might have done differently had someone had
given him a hint of what lay ahead, or if Lincoln had been coerced into
changing his theatre plans. I truly wish I could be more specific on
why you were selected, but I'm afraid the exchange of information will
have to flow in one direction only. (paces out the room) Five, six,
seven metres. Ha! I was right.
