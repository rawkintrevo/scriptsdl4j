[Observation lounge]

WORF: Why now? 
LAFORGE: Right. If you've came back to study us, to study the captain,
why would you pick today? Why not a year ago or a year from now? 
RASMUSSEN: Oh, I picked the right day all right. Just wait, you'll see.
Do you always sit there, on that side of the table? 
WORF: Usually. Why? 
RASMUSSEN: It's not important. 
RIKER: Professor, at what point does time travel become a tool for
historians? 
RASMUSSEN: Now, now, Commander, you know better than that. I've studied
a great deal about your century, including the fact that you're all
quite aware of the dangers of anyone altering the past, and that's
exactly what I'd be doing if I were to divulge information like that. 
CRUSHER: Telurian plague. 
RASMUSSEN: I beg your pardon? 
CRUSHER: The telurian plague. Was it cured? I mean, did they find the
cure by your century? Oh, it can't do any harm to ask that. 
PICARD: I realise that it's difficult, but we must keep to ourselves
questions regarding the future. Go on, Professor. 
RASMUSSEN: I'll be preparing questionnaires for each of you. Please
complete them at your convenience. If you're concerned about a possible
breach of security, I'm sure your Captain can make a determination. And
thank you in advance for curbing your curiosity. 
LAFORGE: If I hand my assignment in on time, can I get a glimpse into
next week's poker game? 
PICARD: Mister Data, would you escort the Professor to his quarters. 
DATA: This way, sir. 
(Data and Rasmussen leave) 
RIKER: What did he mean, he picked the right day? 
PICARD: You know everything I do, Will. 
RIKER: Deanna? 
TROI: It's hard to tell, but he is holding something back. 
CRUSHER: Of course he is. All the things he could tell us. All the
things he would like to tell us. 
TROI: It might be that, I don't know. 
RIKER: What if he's an imposter? God knows we've seen enough of them. 
PICARD: He is human. The medical scans have proved that, right, Doctor?

CRUSHER: He's human, all right. 
PICARD: And there was a temporal distortion back there, correct Mister
Worf? 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: And no one can deny that ship of his is unlike anything we've
ever seen before. 
LAFORGE: The hull is made of some kind of plasticised tritanium mesh.
We've nothing like it on record, at least not till now. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, I do appreciate your caution. I share it. Bring
his vessel into the shuttlebay. Place it under guard. 
WORF: Yes, sir. 
PICARD: I realise that this visit is going to be difficult for some of
us, but I've examined his credentials, and everything seems to be in
order, so I think we should extend to him every courtesy. 
WORF: Including questionnaires? 
PICARD: Including questionnaires, Mister Worf.
