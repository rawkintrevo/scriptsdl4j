[Bridge]

PICARD: Acknowledged. Picard to Crusher. 
[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Sickbay here, Captain. 
PICARD [OC]: Prepare for emergency transport. 
CRUSHER: Yes, sir. 
[Bridge]

CRUSHER [OC]: Crusher out. 
PICARD: Picard to Commander Riker.

[Vico]

PICARD [OC]: Is the boy ready, Number One? 
RIKER: Ready, sir. 
PICARD [OC]: It's your signal. 
RIKER: Aye, Captain. It's going to be okay. Here we go. Energise.

[Transporter room]

PICARD [OC]: Ensign, do we have him? 
HUTCHINSON: The lock is holding. I just can't resolve the matter
stream, not with all that victurium alloy in the way.

[Vico]

HUTCHINSON [OC]: Commander Riker. You'll have to
get him out into the corridor. 
DATA: I could move the beam, sir. However, it may initiate the collapse
of the surrounding supports. I recommend you and Geordi return to the
ship. 
RIKER: Agreed. La Forge. 
[Transporter room]

(Riker and La Forge are beamed in) 
HUTCHINSON: I'm locked onto Commander Data and the boy, sir. I'll
energise as soon as they've cleared the bulkheads. 
RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Data. 
DATA [OC]: Yes, sir. 
[Vico]

TIMOTHY: Are you're going to lift that? 
DATA: Yes. Then I will take you to the corridor. We will transport back
to the Enterprise from there. Do you understand? 
TIMOTHY: How come you can pick up something so heavy? 
DATA: I am an android. My strength is many times that of a human. It is
going to be okay. I will count to three. One two three. 
(he pushes up the beam with one hand, Timothy wriggles out and runs.
Data drops the beam and follows, picking the boy up when he stumbles at
the steps)
DATA: Energise.

Captain's log, supplemental. A thorough search of
the Vico has revealed no additional survivors. We have begun the
process of counselling the boy with regard to the tragedy.
