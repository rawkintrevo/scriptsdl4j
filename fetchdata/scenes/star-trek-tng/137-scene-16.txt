[Bridge]

PICARD: If it was the probe, that explains the
Yamato. But how do you account for the difficulties the Enterprise is
experiencing? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: I can't. 
PICARD [OC]: Lieutenant, Are our problems likely to attain the
seriousness of those on the Yamato? 
LAFORGE: If you're asking for speculation, I'd say yes, sir, they are.
I need time. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Mister La Forge, time is the one thing
which we do not have in abundance. 
(Enterprise arrives at a brown and battered planet) 
PICARD: Analysis, Mister Data. 
DATA: Scanning, sir. 
PICARD: Well, Mister Data? 
DATA: No life-form readings, sir. 
WORF: All major cities have been heavily damaged, and the pattern of
destruction is that consistent with large-scale orbital bombardment. 
PICARD: How long ago? 
DATA: Approximately two hundred thousand years, sir. 
WORF: There is an energy source in the mountains of the smaller
continent. 
PICARD: Magnify. 
RIKER: Is that Iconia? 
PICARD: Captain Varley died believing that it was. 
(There's a little flash from the cross shape inside the crater on the
surface) 
RIKER: Did you see that? 
WORF: Captain. Projectile launched from the planet's surface. 
DATA: Its size and composition match the probe which scanned the
Yamato, sir. 
PICARD: Shields up. Prepare a tractor beam. Mister La Forge, I'm going
to assist you in your research. A probe has been launched from Iconia. 
[Engineering]

PICARD [OC]: I'm going to capture it. 
LAFORGE: No, sir, wait! Captain! Captain! 
(But the comm. system has gone down, so Geordi has to run to the Bridge
instead. The door refuses to open so he heads off another way)

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: Coming through! 
[Turbolift]

LAFORGE: Bridge! 
(The turbolift takes of sideways so quickly it pins him to the door) 
LAFORGE: Emergency stop! 
(Then it goes the other way) 
LAFORGE: Stop! Damn it! 
(Now he's up against the ceiling, then the floor and his visor falls
off. Heck of a roller coaster ride, this one)
