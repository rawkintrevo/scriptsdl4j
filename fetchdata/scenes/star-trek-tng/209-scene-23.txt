DATA [OC]: CO2 concentrations remain unchanged at
upper elevations. 
(three more phaser shots, then Rasmussen enters) 
RASMUSSEN: Have I missed much? 
WORF: Target fourteen complete, sir. 
RIKER: Data? 
[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: What have you got? 
DATA: No change, sir. 
[Pentara Science lab]

RIKER [OC]: How are the surface winds, Geordi? 
LAFORGE [OC]: Holding steady, sir. 
[Bridge]

WORF: The computer has stopped drilling. 
RIKER: You should be getting something

[Engineering]

RIKER [OC]: Now, Data. 
DATA: Elevated CO2 levels at twenty kilometres, sir. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Now you're 
[Penthara Science lab]

LAFORGE: Talking. We've got some new temperatures
coming in. 
MOSELEY: All thermal monitoring stations are reporting no further
temperature drops. 
LAFORGE: Correction, Doctor. Two equatorial stations are showing slight
increases. 
MOSELEY: Thank you. Thank you all. You've given us what we need. Time.

PICARD: We're glad to be of help, Doctor. The
Enterprise will remain in orbit and continue to monitor your progress.
Picard out. 
RASMUSSEN: You've given us what we need. Time. 
PICARD: Ensign, return to synchronous orbit. 
ENSIGN: Aye, sir. 
RASMUSSEN: Very clever, Picard. And well done. We've always known how
you did it, but to experience the moment, to witness the nuances, it's
indescribable.

(Beverly is treating an injured knee) 
TROI: He's after more than a history lesson. I can tell you that. 
CRUSHER: What is it? What are you getting from him? 
TROI: I don't know. It's like he's trying to confuse us, misdirect us
somehow. 
(Rasmussen enters) 
RASMUSSEN: There you are. Well, that certainly was exciting, wasn't it?

CRUSHER: Professor, is everything alright? Are you well? 
RASMUSSEN: Yes, couldn't be better, thank you. I just thought we might
chat about your questionnaire. Buck up, crewman. You're a credit to
that uniform. 
TROI: I've got some things to take care of. 
RASMUSSEN: No, please, Counsellor. I would very much appreciate your
remaining. 
RASMUSSEN: Doctor, in response to my sixth question, you spoke of a
neural stimulator. May I see one? 
CRUSHER: I don't see why not. Give me a minute. 
(Beverly leaves) 
RASMUSSEN: You don't like me very much, do you? 
TROI: I don't dislike you, Professor. 
RASMUSSEN: (to a young boy) Keep your eyes wide, soldier. You'll be
telling your grandchildren how you were there at Penthara Four. But you
don't trust me. You should, you know. 
TROI: Should I? 
RASMUSSEN: Picard's empath won't trust you. That's what they all said. 
TROI: Picard's empath? 
RASMUSSEN: We're not that unalike, you and I. You possess a sense that
is foreign to the others. My knowledge of the future is similar. You
know, some of my best friends are empaths. They trust me. 
TROI: Why should you care whether I trust you or not? 
RASMUSSEN: We're birds of a feather. We're colleagues. We could learn a
lot from each other. 
TROI: You're right. I don't trust you. 
RASMUSSEN: I knew you'd say that. 
TROI: I'm sure you did. 
(Beverly returns with the equipment) 
CRUSHER: Well, it's nice to see you two are finally getting along. 
TROI: I really have to be going. 
(Troi leaves and Beverly hands the wand device to Rasmussen) 
RASMUSSEN: Thank you. 
CRUSHER: (reading a PADD from a nurse) Why don't you try a berylite
scan? I'd be interested to see where his micro-levels are. 
(the nurse leaves them) 
CRUSHER: So, what else can I show you? 
RASMUSSEN: You're a very curious woman. No, no, I don't mean curious
like that. I mean you're curious about things. About berylite levels,
about the future. 
CRUSHER: Well, curiosity is why all of us are out here, isn't it? 
RASMUSSEN: I understand. But you're different, you're more vibrant.
More 
CRUSHER: More vibrant. That's nice, I like that. 
RASMUSSEN: You know, whenever I travel back, I meet very interesting
people, men and women. But I've never anyone who gave me thoughts about
not going home. 
CRUSHER: You're not supposed to be influencing the past, remember? And
I am beginning to feel a little influenced. Anyway, I could be your
great, great, great, great, grandmother.
