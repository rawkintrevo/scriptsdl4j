[Ready room] 
PICARD: What have you learned? 
DATA: We have completed a scan of the planet surface. 
RIKER: We've discovered the second lab is on the far side of the
planet, completely destroyed. Unable to determine what caused it.
Otherwise, very little to clarify the situation. 
DATA: Our sensors show an immense volume of energy emanating deep
within the planet, and concentrated near Manheim's remaining
laboratory. 
PICARD: How is the energy being used. 
RIKER: No idea. 
PICARD: What's it's source? 
DATA: I cannot be sure, sir, but I believe Manheim has developed a
method for harnessing energy from the pulsar. 
RIKER: It comes down to this, Captain. We've learned everything we can
from here, and we are no closer to understanding it than we were twelve
hours ago. Manheim is unable to help us, but hopefully, having been a
good scientist, he kept notes. 
DATA: I would need to study Manheim's records. 
RIKER: And in order to do that we're going to have to go down there. 
PICARD: What about the defence system Mrs. Manheim spoke of? 
RIKER: It may have been connected to the main system, and when she
lowered the shield she may have turned that off as well. If not, we'll
deal with it as best we can. 
PICARD: Prepare your team. 
RIKER: Aye, sir. 
[Transporter room]

RIKER: Coordinates set? 
CHIEF: Yes, sir.
RIKER: Energise. 
CHIEF: There's a lack of integrity at the landing point.

CHIEF [OC]: I'm losing them. 
PICARD: Bring them back. Now. Chief Herbert, what's going on?
