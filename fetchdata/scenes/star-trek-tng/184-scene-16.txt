[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: Lie down, breathe deeply and stay calm.
I'm getting calls from all over the ship. I'll be there as quickly as I
can.

[Bridge]

ALLENBY: New heading confirmed. Zero two five mark
two seven three. Speed is holding at one tenth impulse. 
RIKER: Whatever's pulling us sure isn't in a hurry. 
PICARD: Picard to La Forge. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Go ahead, Captain. 
PICARD: If your engines are functioning we'll attempt to break free.

[Engineering]

LAFORGE: Everything down here seems normal enough,
sir, but I suggest we take it a bit slower this time.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees to
starboard. 
ALLENBY: New course laid in at ninety degrees to starboard. 
PICARD: One quarter impulse, engage. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. Nothing, Captain. Speed and course are unaffected. 
PICARD: One half impulse. 
ALLENBY: No change. 
PICARD: Full impulse. Rotate heading in five degree increments. 
ALLENBY: Aye, sir. 
(the ship shakes) 
RIKER: La Forge? 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: There's nothing wrong down here. The
engines are fine.

[Bridge]

DATA: Integrity field stress exceeding eighty two
million kilodynes. Recommend immediate shutdown, sir. 
PICARD: Make it so, Ensign. 
ALLENBY: All engines down. We're still being pulled. Same heading, same
speed.

[Troi's office]

CRUSHER: I got here as quickly as I could. I've got
a Sickbay filled with headaches. How are you? 
TROI: Well, when I first called you I was feeling intense pain. Now
it's gone, but I'm feeling a bit foggy. 
CRUSHER: I'd like to take you to Sickbay and run an inner nuncial
series. Can you walk? 
RIKER [OC]: All senior staff report to the Observation Lounge. 
CRUSHER: Are you up to that? 
TROI: I think so. 
(then she gets a look of horror on her face) 
CRUSHER: What is it? 
TROI: Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
