oh damage agree swamp let counting hammer bacteria happened

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Number One. 
RIKER: Captain. 
PICARD: Put your foot where it didn't belong? 
RIKER: The Doctor said she was getting bored. I just thought I'd give
her a challenge. 
PULASKI: That you did. The Commander's nervous system has been invaded
by an unknown microorganism. Not a bacteria, not a virus, but with the
elements of both. There's the point of entry. The microbes are
infecting the great sciatic nerve, and they are multiplying at an
incredible rate. There. 
PICARD: Can you remove it? 
PULASKI: Not surgically. The organisms fuse to the nerve, intertwining
at the molecular level. 
RIKER: That's why the transporter's biofilters weren't able to extract
it. 
PULASKI: There's no evidence of nerve damage, but the organisms are
impeding nervous function. 
RIKER: My leg's still asleep. 
PICARD: Prognosis? 
PULASKI: The infection is spreading. It will eventually reach the
brain. 
PICARD: And if it interfered with neural activity there? 
PULASKI: Commander Riker could die. 
PICARD: How can I help? 
PULASKI: I need to know more about its composition. 
PICARD: And for that, you need a sample. 
PULASKI: Exactly. 
PICARD: Commander Data, Mister La Forge, prepare to beam down to the
planet. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Aye, sir.

[Transporter room]

DATA: I must reiterate, it would be better if I
went alone. 
LAFORGE: Don't like my company? 
DATA: Your company is not at issue. Your vulnerability to the
microorganism is. 
LAFORGE: I'll watch where I step. Besides, how do we know that this bug
doesn't like androids more than it likes humans? 
DATA: Possible, but highly unlikely. In any event, why risk both of us?

LAFORGE: Because I know exactly where Commander Riker was when it
happened. 
DATA: Mister O'Brien, energise. 
[Steamy mangrove swamp]

LAFORGE: He was right over here. 
DATA: I am detecting no animal life within fifty kilometres. However, I
am reading extensive animal remains, mostly fossilised. 
LAFORGE: A graveyard? 
DATA: I do not know. 
LAFORGE: Data, that a look at this. 
(an external root) 
DATA: The structure is rhizomatous. 
LAFORGE: Careful. 
DATA: I am always careful. 
DATA: It appears to be dead. 
LAFORGE: I'm not so sure. I can see thermal variations. Let it go for a
second, Data. Let's try something. Perhaps it likes humans more than
androids. 
DATA: If you are correct, you are placing yourself in grave danger. 
LAFORGE: I'm counting on those great android reflexes of yours. 
(Even as he spoke, the root moved towards Geordi, and Data grabbed it) 
LAFORGE: That must be what we're looking for. 
DATA: I would tend to agree. 
(Geordi phasers the wicked thorn from the side of the root. This seems
to hurt the plant) 
LAFORGE: Stand by, O'Brien. Got it. Energise!

[Transporter room]

LAFORGE: Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute, and we'd
have been fossils ourselves. 
DATA: Not precisely, Geordi. True fossilisation requires several
millennia. 
LAFORGE: Here's your sample, Captain. 
PICARD: Get it to Sickbay right away. 
(La Forge leaves) 
PICARD: Report. 
DATA: Captain, Commander Riker's injury was not accidental. Certain
vines on the planet evidently seek out warm-blooded beings and
deliberately infect them. 
PICARD: To what end? 
DATA: Unknown, sir. It is conceivable there is a symbiotic relationship
involved. 
PICARD: Go on. 
DATA: There are numerous animal remains in the area, leading me to
hypothesize that the vines could be predatory. 
PICARD: Vines infect animals in order to kill them? 
DATA: It is possible. For Commander Riker's sake, I hope my hypothesis
is in error. 
PICARD: Unfortunately, Mister Data, your hypotheses rarely are.

[Pulaski's office] 
PULASKI: All negative. 
PICARD: Is there nothing that will cure this infection?
PULASKI: This microorganism is very mysterious. I can't even figure out
what's keeping it alive. 
PICARD: Or how to kill it. 
PULASKI: Oh, I can kill it but not without destroying the nerves it's
inhabiting. 
PICARD: I know you're doing your best, Doctor. 
PULASKI: My best may not be good enough.

[Sickbay]

PICARD: Comfortable? 
RIKER: Why wouldn't I be comfortable? They're waiting on me hand and
foot. I hope that they don't find out that I'm faking it. 
PICARD: I wish you were faking it. I've seen the thorn. 
RIKER: Yes, Doctor showed it to me, too. Rather harmless-looking thing,
I thought. 
PICARD: And deadly. I'm sorry. 
RIKER: Well, these things happen. 
PICARD: When least expected. 
RIKER: I'm surprised they don't happen more often. After all, we are
exploring the unknown. 
PICARD: And the unknown can be benign or malevolent. 
RIKER: Captain, one of the things I've learned anything on these
voyages, on this ship, and from you, is that most life forms act out of
an instinct for survival, not out of malice. 
PICARD: It's an important lesson, and I admire your lack of resentment,
Number One. 
RIKER: If you drop a hammer on your foot, it's hardly useful to get mad
at the hammer.
