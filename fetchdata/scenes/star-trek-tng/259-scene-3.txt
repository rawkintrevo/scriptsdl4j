LWAXANA TROI

[Corridor]

LWAXANA: Deanna! Good morning. So what did you
think of Maques? 
TROI: Why did you do that, Mother? You embarrassed both of us. 
LWAXANA: He's really very sweet. And lonely. Poor man. A widower,
raising a child alone. 
TROI: Mother, don't start. 
LWAXANA: I just think it's time for you to settle down. If your father
were still alive, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.

[Turbolift]

(there is a crewman in the turbolift) 
TROI: Deck eight. 
LWAXANA [OC]: But you'll do exactly what you want. Just like always. 
TROI: Mother, stop it. 
(the door opens) 
TROI: Are you coming? 
(Lwaxana is crying. Troi gently leads her out) 
[Corridor]

TROI: What's wrong? 
LWAXANA: You are so precious to me. You're all I've got. If something
happened to you I don't know what I'd do. 
TROI: Nothing's going to happen to me. 
LWAXANA: You'd better go. 
TROI: My first appointment isn't for a few minutes. Why don't we talk
for a while? 
LWAXANA: No, I'm fine. I'm just tired from working with the Cairn. It's
making me emotional. 
TROI: Are you sure? 
LWAXANA: Go on I'll see you later. Go on.
