Q PICARD SONYA LAFORGE

[Turbolift]

PICARD: Deck nine. Officers' quarters.

[Shuttlecraft]

(But instead of a deck, he steps out into a
shuttlecraft in space) 
PICARD: Crewman? What is going on?
Q: Welcome, Picard, to shuttlecraft six. 
PICARD: Q. 
Q: There, there, haven't we been careless. A little cleaning service
I'm only too than happy to provide.
(A wave of the hand and the uniform is clean again) 
PICARD: We agreed you would never trouble my ship again! 
Q: I always keep my arrangements, sir. Look, we're nowhere near your
vessel.

[Corridor]

LAFORGE: I read your graduating thesis. Now, I
wouldn't have requested you if you weren't the best.
SONYA: Where are we going?
LAFORGE: Ten Forward. We're going to forget about work. We are going to
sit, talk, relax, look at the stars. You need to learn how to slow down.
SONYA: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I can't do.
LAFORGE: You know, you're awfully young to be so driven.
SONYA: Yes, I am. I had to be. I had to be the best because only the
best get to be here. Geordi, Lieutenant 
LAFORGE: It's okay. Go on. 
SONYA: Whatever is out here, we're going to be the first humans to see
it. And I want to be a part of that. I want to understand it. 
LAFORGE: Sonya, relax. You're here. You've made it. But you won't last
long banging into walls. It'll be there for you, believe me. 
SONYA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Look, I promise I won't let anything exciting slip past
without letting you know, okay? 
SONYA: Okay. 
LAFORGE: Okay.
