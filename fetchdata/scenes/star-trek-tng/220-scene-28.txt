over the ship. 
WORF: Captain, we've dropped to warp five point seven. 
PICARD: Picard to Engineering. 
LAFORGE [OC]: La Forge here. 
PICARD: What's happening, Mister La Forge? We're losing speed. 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: The parasites must've gotten into the
primary warp controllers, Captain. Trying to do a bypass patch to
isolate the backup controllers but it looks like warp six is about the
best I'm going to be able to give you.

PICARD: At that speed, Mister La Forge, there won't
be a ship left to reach the Pelloris Field. Do what you have to. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Working on it, sir. 
DATA: Captain, we're losing life support on decks eleven and twelve. 
PICARD: Mister Worf, have security evacuate all personnel from those
decks. 
WORF: Aye, sir.

point five but I don't know how much more coaxing
