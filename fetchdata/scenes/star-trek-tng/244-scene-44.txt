[Sickbay]

PICARD: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll send your
regrets.

[Arkaria base]

RIKER: How is he, Doctor? 
CRUSHER: He's in a lot of pain, but I think he should be fine. He needs
some water. Is that all right? 
(She goes slowly to the water fountain, where Troi can hear but not
Orton or the waiter) 
CRUSHER: (sotto) We're almost ready. When we set the visor to emit the
hypersonic pulse, there'll be a short burst of light. We need a
distraction. 
(Troi crosses to Riker) 
TROI: (sotto) They need a distraction. 
RIKER: How long? 
TROI: Just a few seconds. 
RIKER: I think I can distract Orton for a few seconds. 
TROI: I don't think Orton's in a talking mood, Will. 
RIKER: You just have to know how to talk to him. Orton, I think we need
to discuss the situation. 
ORTON: There is nothing to discuss. Sit down. 
RIKER: There's a lot to discuss. Can't we be reasonable? 
ORTON: I am not interested in hearing your hostage negotiation tactics,
Commander. 
RIKER: It can't hurt you to listen, can it? 
ORTON: All right. 
RIKER: Thank you. Now, the first thing I think we need to discuss is
this. 
(He knocks Orton down and gets thumped by the waiter in return. The
visor is set) 
[Corridor]

(The sweep is halfway through the saucer section) 
(Picard shoots Pomet in the leg, and he passes out. Picard is just
getting his weapon when ) 
KIROS: Hold it. Put your weapon down. Kelsey, this is Kiros. I'm on
deck ten. 
[Jefferies tube]

KIROS [OC]: I have Mott. 
KELSEY: Is he alive? 
KIROS [OC]: Yes. 
KELSEY: Good. Meet us at intersection forty one. 
KIROS [OC]: Understood.

[Corridor]

KIROS: This way. Move.

[Jefferies tube]

KELSEY: Give me the trilithium. 
NEIL: How much farther do we have to go? 
KELSEY: Not far. With all the modifications you've made to this unit,
are we going to have any troubles removing the trilithium? 
NEIL: No. Just remove the control rod, drain the unit. There shouldn't
be any problem. 
KELSEY: That's all I wanted to know. 
(we can assume she kills Neil) 
[Corridor]

KELSEY: Well, not as clever as you thought. Where's
Pomet? 
KIROS: He shot him with some kind of an arrow. 
PICARD: He's not dead. 
KELSEY: Well, he will be soon. The sweep's nearly here. We don't have
time to go back for him. 
KIROS: What about Neil? 
KELSEY: The sweep got him. Let's go. 
[Arkaria base]

TROI: I thought you were just going to talk to him.

RIKER: I did. He just didn't like what I had to say. 
(an alarm sounds, and Orton goes to a computer terminal in a recess) 
DATA: That was a perimeter warning from the Remmler Array. A small ship
is approaching. I believe Mister Orton has dropped his defence shields.

RIKER: This must be the sign they were waiting for. Mister Data, you
will be the only one unaffected by the hypersonic burst. As soon as
every else is unconscious, I need you to get to the computer panel and
stop that ship somehow. 
DATA: I will try, sir. 
CRUSHER: Now. 
(an ear-splitting noise fills the room, and all the people drop. Data
takes the weapons and starts work on the computer) 
[Corridor]

PICARD: Kelsey, perhaps we can work out a deal. 
KELSEY: You're the only one who needs a deal, Mot. 
PICARD: My name isn't Mot. It's Jean-Luc Picard. 
KELSEY: Captain Picard. This is all beginning to make sense. 
PICARD: Leave the trilithium here and take me with you. You can use me
as a hostage instead of threatening 
KELSEY: I'm not a terrorist Captain, nor do I have a political agenda,
although I know some people who do have agendas. And they are very
interested in this little container. 
PICARD: Profit. This is all about profit. 
KELSEY: I prefer to think of it as commerce. Open the door. Now go
through, slowly.
