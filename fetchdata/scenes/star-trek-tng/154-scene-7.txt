WESLEY GUINAN LAFORGE RIKER

[Ten forward]

LAFORGE: Don't you have anything stronger than
this, Guinan? 
GUINAN: Yes. 
LAFORGE: Would it help? 
GUINAN: No. 
LAFORGE: Tell me something, Guinan. You're a woman, right? 
GUINAN: Yes, I can tell you I'm a woman. 
LAFORGE: What is it that you want in a man? 
GUINAN: Me personally? 
LAFORGE: As a woman. What's the first thing you look at? 
GUINAN: His head. 
LAFORGE: His mind. Of course. 
GUINAN: No, his head. I'm attracted to bald men. 
LAFORGE: Seriously? 
GUINAN: Seriously. 
LAFORGE: Why? 
GUINAN: Maybe because a bald man was very kind to me once when I was
hurting. Took care of me. 
LAFORGE: I'd like to do that. 
GUINAN: I take care of myself these days. 
LAFORGE: I mean, take care of somebody. I just don't get it, Guinan. I
can field strip a fusion reactor. I can realign a power transfer
tunnel. Why can't I make anything work with a woman like Christi? It's
like I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say. 
GUINAN: You're doing fine with me. 
LAFORGE: You're different. 
GUINAN: No, you're different. 
LAFORGE: But I'm not trying now. 
GUINAN: That's my point.

RIKER: What is it, Wes? 
WESLEY: The main power returner is acting a little weird. 
RIKER: Define weird. 
WESLEY: I'm getting fluctuating waveguide readings. 
RIKER: Run a maintenance sweep. 
WESLEY: Right.
