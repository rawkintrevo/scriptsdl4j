RIKER VOICE TAVA BEREL NURSE LANEL NILREM

[Riker's hospital room]

(Riker is out of bed and looking for a way out when
a woman enters) 
LANEL: There are guards out there. You'll never escape that way. I'm
not afraid of you. 
RIKER: Good. Because there's nothing to be afraid of. 
LANEL: We shouldn't fear the unknown. We should embrace it. 
RIKER: Can you help me get out of here? 
LANEL: Are you really an alien? It's all right to tell me. 
RIKER: No, I'm not an alien. 
LANEL: I don't believe you. You are an alien. 
RIKER: I really have to leave. 
LANEL: I could divert the guard's attention. You might stand a chance
if you took the service exit down the hallway to the right. 
RIKER: To the right? Fine, let's do it. 
LANEL: Why should I? 
RIKER: Well, you know why. I don't belong here. I have to get back on
my ship, in space. 
LANEL: I believe you. 
RIKER: Now, will you help me? 
LANEL: If you make love to me. 
RIKER: What? 
LANEL: I've always wanted to make love with an alien. 
RIKER: Listen, Miss 
LANEL: Lanel. 
RIKER: Lanel, I really have to get going. All the other aliens are
waiting for me. 
LANEL: Oh, it's not so much to ask, and then I'll help you escape. 
RIKER: It's not that easy. There are differences in the way that my
people make love. 
LANEL: I can't wait to learn. 
(she takes of her spectacles) 
RIKER: But it's 
LANEL: It's your only way out of here, my alien.

[Medical Facility Corridor]

(an undetermined length of time later) 
LANEL: Something's happened to him. I think he's dead. Go on, get some
help. 
(the guard runs off, and she beckons Riker out of the room) 
LANEL: Okay. No, that way. 
RIKER: Thanks. 
LANEL: Will I ever see you again? 
RIKER: I'll call you the next time I pass through your star system. 
(Riker heads off down the corridor, but gets spotted) 
NILREM: Stop him! Somebody stop him! 
NURSE: Hold it. 
VOICE [OC]: He's escaping! The alien's escaping! 
(Riker knocks out a guard who swings at him with a club, then a second,
but he is finally brought down and kicked while he is on the floor) 
BEREL: Stop it! All of you! Stop it now! Have you all lost your minds? 
TAVA: They've aggravated the injury to his renal organ. He's bleeding
internally. 
BEREL: Get him into a surgical cubicle. And call Central Security. This
has gone too far.
