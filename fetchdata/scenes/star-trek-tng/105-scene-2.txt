[Bridge]

PICARD: Such a beautiful world. Legends say it has
been known to mend souls and heal broken hearts. 
DATA: Legends which are totally unsupported by fact, Captain. 
PICARD: Legends like that are the spice of the universe, Mister Data,
because they have a way of sometimes coming true. 
[Riker's quarters]

(Riker is relaxing to a holographic pair of women
playing musical instruments) 
TASHA [OC]: Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker, your presence is
requested in Transporter room one. 
RIKER: Sorry ladies. Duty calls.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: You needed me, Lieutenant? 
TASHA: Yes, sir. There's an object of some kind beaming in from Haven. 
RIKER: What is it? 
TASHA: We're not sure. 
CHIEF: Surface Station approval coming in now, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: All right, let's bring it in. 
(It's a box, with a face in relief on the front of it) 
RIKER: Odd looking. 
(Troi enters) 
TROI: What's going on? 
(The face on the box comes alive) 
FACE: I hold a message for Deanna Troi. Lwaxana Troi and the honourable
Miller family will soon arrive. The momentous day is close at hand.
Rejoice. 
TROI: No. No. 
RIKER: What's going on? 
(The box bursts open and scatters gems on the transporter pad) 
TASHA: Jewels. Look at these jewels. 
TROI: They're bonding gifts. What you would call wedding presents. 
RIKER: Who's getting married? 
TROI: I am.
