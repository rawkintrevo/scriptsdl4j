[Ready room]

TROI: I was certain it would never happen, Captain.
The years I'd spend on this mission, the distance it has taken me away
from home. As you must have heard, genetic bonding is a Betazoid
tradition. Steven Miller was my father's closest friend. 
RIKER: Your father was human, Deanna. The Millers are human 
PICARD: Will you and your husband be staying with the ship, Counsellor?

TROI: No, sir. 
PICARD: Then I'll just say congratulations for now, Deanna. You'll
excuse me? 
(Picard leaves) 
TROI: Bill, more than anything else in the world, anything, you want to
be a starship captain. True? 
RIKER: That's not all I want, Deanna. 
TROI: I can feel that. I know you care, within those limits. Did you
hear what I said? 
RIKER: Every word. This whole thing is still bizarre. I'm sorry. 
TROI: Come dance at my wedding. 
RIKER: I'll try. 
(Riker leaves as Data enters) 
DATA: A message from planet Haven, Counsellor. They wish to beam the
Miller wedding party aboard.

[Transporter room]

(Mr. Steven Miller, Mrs. Victoria Miller and their
son Wyatt beam aboard) 
PICARD: I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.

GUEST2: Quite some starship you have here, Captain. Look forward to
this visit. 
GUEST0: You couldn't be 
TROI: I'm Deanna. 
GUEST0: Deanna darling! You probably don't even remember me. 
GUEST2: Wyatt was absolutely right. She is a beauty. 
GUEST5: I'm Wyatt. 
GUEST0: Isn't this simply beautiful? I knew romance was still alive,
somewhere. 
GUEST5: I'd like you to have this. It's a Chameleon Rose. It changes
colour with the mood of its owner. 
TROI: It's wonderful. Thank you. When is my mother arriving? 
GUEST5: Your mother is still down on the planet, Deanna. 
TROI: Why? 
GUEST5: Er, is there a place for my parents to rest, Captain? 
GUEST2: Well, we're not really tired, son. Besides, I'd like to see
some of the ship. 
GUEST0: Steven, you know full well Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam
on aboard until we leave. So? 
PICARD: You can see your quarters now, if you like. Will you show the
Millers to their accommodations, please, and I shall join you later. 
(The Millers leave) 
CHIEF: Two more are ready to beam in, sir. 
PICARD: So be it. Wyatt seems a fine young man. 
TROI: Yes, he does. But I'm not what he expected. 
PICARD: I don't understand. 
TROI: Neither do I, but I'm definitely a surprise of some sort to him.
I should warn you, sir. My mother is a little eccentric. 
(A large man is sitting on a chest, and a woman has her back to them) 
LWAXANA: Where is everyone? Oh, I hate that. 
TROI: Hello, Mother 
LWAXANA [OC]: Don't say it, think it. Use your mind, not your mouth. 
TROI: Hello Mother. 
LWAXANA [OC]: Deanna, shame. What has this life done to you? 
LWAXANA: No, don't tell me. You're the Captain. 
PICARD: Of course. Your daughter has explained your telepathic ability.

LWAXANA: That wasn't telepathy, it was just common sense. Who else
would they send to greet me but the Captain? You may carry my luggage. 
TROI: Mother! 
PICARD: No, no, that's quite all right. I'm indebted to your mother for
the fine Counsellor she 
(The luggage is heavier than he expected. A lot heavier) 
PICARD: (straining himself) This way.
