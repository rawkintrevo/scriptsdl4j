(Tasha is sashaying down the corridor, eyeing up
men, as other crew canoodle. She grabs a guy in blue and gives him a
long hard kiss) 
[Bridge]

DATA: Captain, another forty-one minutes will see
the information from the Tsiolkovsky downloaded to us. 
PICARD: Why so slow? 
DATA: Slow, sir? The Tsiolkovsky has been eight months in accumulating
it. 
PICARD: How much danger from that star? Worse case. 
DATA: Like a full collapse, sir? Any stellar material it threw this way
we could still outrun on half impulse power.

PICARD [OC]: Picard to Engineering. Chief Engineer
report to the Bridge. 
(A woman marches out) 
PICARD [OC]: Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda, report to Medical. 
(Wesley enters and offers his sweaty hand for a shake) 
WESLEY: Hi, Jim. Was that the Captain sending you to Medical? 
SHIMODA: Which would leave no one on duty here. The Chief was just
summoned to the Bridge. 
WESLEY: What about me? I could call the Chief on the Bridge if anything
happened. 
(Shimoda leaves, and Wesley looks smug)

[Bridge]

MACDOUGAL: Reporting as ordered, sir. 
PICARD: What? 
MACDOUGAL: You ordered me to report to the Bridge, sir. 
PICARD: I did no such thing. I want you down in the Engine room just in
case we need to move out of here. 
PICARD [OC]: Attention all decks, all divisions. Effective immediately,
I have handed over control of this vessel to Acting Captain Wesley
Crusher. 
PICARD: Acting Captain? 
WESLEY [OC]: Thank you, Captain Picard, thank you. And with that order
dawns a brave new day for the Enterprise.

Captain's log, Stardate 41209.3. The strange
contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now
aboard the Enterprise and our Engineering section has been commandeered
by young Wesley Crusher.

WESLEY: And henceforth, a dessert course shall
precede and follow every meal. Including breakfast. 
CREWMAN: Hurray for the acting Captain! 
(The entire Engineering crew are out of their skulls) 
SHIMODA: Never got as far as Sickbay, Wes. I feel too good for that. 
(He walks into a force field) 
SHIMODA: Incredible. How did you do that? 
WESLEY: Hooked my model tractor beam into ship's power. Now its a
repulser beam too. Want in? 
SHIMODA: Swear to be faithful to you, Captain. 
(Wesley lets him stagger into his area)

PICARD: Number One, MacDougal, get that boy out of
Engineering. 
(Riker and MacDougal leave) 
WORF: Sir, I'm getting very strange reports from all decks. 
PICARD: Such as? 
WORF: Such as the ship's Training Division ordering all officers to
attend a lecture on metaphysics. 
PICARD: Metaphysics? 
DATA: Confirmed, sir. And there was a rather peculiar limerick being
delivered by someone in the Shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure I
understand it. There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shaped
like 
PICARD: Captain to Security, come in! 
DATA: Did I say something wrong? 
WORF: I don't understand their humour either. 
SECURITY [OC]: Yeah, Captain? 
PICARD: Where is my security chief! Get me Lieutenant Yar. 
SECURITY [OC]: Keep your britches on. 
TASHA [OC]: (lilting) Captain Picard. 
PICARD: Lieutenant, where are you? 
TASHA [OC]: I'm in my quarters, and I'm pretty busy right at the
moment, Jean-Luc. 
PICARD: All right, Lieutenant, you just stay right there. Data, please
go to Lieutenant Yar and take her down to Sickbay. 
DATA: Yes, sir. 
(Data leaves) 
PICARD: Captain to Security, I want all your senior supervisors to
report to the Bridge immediately.

[Tasha's Quarters]

(We hear giggling as Data enters cautiously) 
DATA: Lieutenant Yar? 
TASHA: Here, Data. You wanted me? 
(She has slicked down her hair, and is wearing a curious outfit that
leaves the ribcage and stomach bare) 
DATA: Captain Picard ordered me to escort you to Sickbay, Lieutenant. 
TASHA: Did he say when? 
DATA: I am sure he meant now. So, you need time to get into uniform. 
TASHA: But I got out of uniform for you, Data. Do you know how old I
was when I was abandoned? 
DATA: Chronological age? No, I am afraid I am not familiar with 
TASHA: Five. Five years old, but I survived. I learned how to stay
alive, how to avoid the rape gangs. I was fifteen before I escaped. 
DATA: I am sorry. I did not know, 
TASHA: And what I want now is gentleness. And joy. And love. From you,
Data. You are fully functional, aren't you? 
DATA: Of course, but 
TASHA: How fully? 
DATA: In every way, of course. I am programmed in multiple techniques,
a broad variety of pleasuring, 
TASHA: Oh, you jewel! That's exactly what I hoped. 
(She leads him into the bedroom and sits him down on the bed)
