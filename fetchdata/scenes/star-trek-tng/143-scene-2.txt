PULASKI PICARD RIKER WESLEY

[Pulaski's office]

PICARD: I will not have you telling me what course
to set. 
PULASKI: As Chief Medical Officer, I am ordering you to report to
Starbase Five One Five immediately. 
PICARD: Oh, please. I feel fine. 
PULASKI: The truth is, you've ignored this far too long. 
PICARD: This ship has a mission to carry out. 
PULASKI: An astronomical survey to be conducted by the science
officers, I believe. 
PICARD: And I 'was looking forward to seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster
for myself. 
PULASKI: Then we'll perform the procedure right here. 
PICARD: Absolutely not. 
PULASKI: My staff and I are fully capable of giving you the
replacement. 
PICARD: That's not the point. It would be (deep breath) It would be
inappropriate for you to carry out the procedure. 
PULASKI: Captain Picard, I had no idea. You do have an ego, don't you? 
PICARD: Meaning? 
PULASKI: You're concerned about your image. Don't worry. If you get
yourself down to Starbase Five One Five, your image will be safe with
me.

(Wesley meets Picard as he exits the turbolift) 
WESLEY: Captain, excuse me. 
PICARD: Ensign. I understand you're leaving for Starbase Five One Five.

WESLEY: Yes, sir. I was just going to shuttlebay two. 
PICARD: Good. I have business there. I shall accompany you. 
WESLEY: You will? I mean, yes sir. 
PICARD: Prepare the shuttle for immediate departure. 
WESLEY: Aye, sir. 
RIKER: Something I can take care of for you on Starbase Five One Five? 
PICARD: Hardly, Number One. 
RIKER: But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar survey. 
PICARD: I'm well aware of that fact. You have the Bridge. Carry on.
