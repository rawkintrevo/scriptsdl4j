TROI LAFORGE PICARD RIKER CRUSHER MACDOUGAL

[Engineering ]

PICARD [OC]: What have you learned, Number One? 
RIKER: Captain, the ship's engines are cut off from the bridge. The
Assistant Chief Engineer pulled out the isolinear optical chips from
command. All engines are offline. Wesley has hooked some kind of
tractor beam to ship's power and he has it aimed at the door. We can't
get past to get at the computer. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: Can you short out the power? 
[Engineering]

MACDOUGAL: Yes, I can. But it's going to take some
time.

[Bridge]

PICARD: Do it!

TROI: Bill.
RIKER: Deanna, what? 
TROI: So many minds on this ship, all free. Released, 
RIKER: Deanna. 
(She strokes his chest) 
TROI: I can feel them all. What they want, what they feel. It's a side
of humans I've never felt before. 
RIKER: Come on, I'm getting you to Sickbay. 
(He picks her up and carries her) 
TROI: Wouldn't you rather be alone with me? With me in your mind?

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: (injecting Geordi) The medical records we
found say this works almost instantly. 
LAFORGE: It's not fair, Doc. I've never seen a rainbow, sunset,
sunrise. This is going to help me? Help me see like you? 
(Riker enters carrying Deanna) 
RIKER: Doctor Crusher? 
[Crusher's office]

RIKER: Deanna needs your help. 
CRUSHER: The formula from the old Enterprise didn't work. 
RIKER: What? 
CRUSHER: This water-carbon complex may induce the same symptoms, but
somehow it's different. Maybe it's mutated. But I've got to isolate
it in order to analyse it, 
RIKER: We don't have that kind of time. 
CRUSHER: You brought Deanna in. 
RIKER: She's infected with 
CRUSHER: Then you touched her! Oh, God. And you touched me. Wait! I've
got to quarantine you. 
RIKER: If I don't get the command computer back online soon, none of
this, whatever this is, won't matter. We'll all be dead.

Captain's log, supplemental. It is no longer an
inconvenient, childish prank. Young Wesley Crusher, admittedly a victim
of the Tsiolkovsky infection, is now in control of my starship.
