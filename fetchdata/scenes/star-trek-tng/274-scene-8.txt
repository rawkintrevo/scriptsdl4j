wants force parent hours admit time jean fine hello

[Crusher's office]

CRUSHER: Jean-Luc, come in. 
PICARD: I think I need to talk to a parent. 
CRUSHER: So, what's he like? 
PICARD: I'm not sure that I can tell you. He puts up so many barriers I
have no idea what's underneath. 
CRUSHER: Keep in mind he's had twenty years to be angry that his father
wasn't there. It's going to take some time to get over those feelings.
But I do think it's possible. 
PICARD: Perhaps. But surely it would be wrong to force the issue. My
sense is that he's a very independent young man. Perhaps it would be
best if I left him alone. Let him come to me if he wants to. 
CRUSHER: Maybe you're right. But I think you should consider this. Are
you doing the best thing for Jason or what's easiest for you?

[Jason's quarters]

(doorbell) 
JASON: Yeah? 
TROI: Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi, Ship's Counsellor. 
JASON: Come in. Did Captain Picard ask you to come talk to me? 
TROI: No, I just thought I'd come and see how you were doing. A lot's
happened in the last few hours. I thought you might like to talk about
it. 
JASON: I'll be all right. People have wanted to kill me before. 
TROI: But you've never met your father before. 
JASON: And I have to admit I never thought I would. 
TROI: It must be somewhat overwhelming. 
JASON: I'm a little shaky. 
TROI: Well, that's only natural. 
JASON: But you know what? I feel better already just talking to you. 
TROI: So, how did you feel about the Captain, about your father? 
JASON: He's okay. A little stiff. But where are you from? 
TROI: I was born on Betazed. 
JASON: Do all the women there have eyes like yours? 
TROI: Look Jason, I came here to talk to you because I'm the Ship's
Counsellor. If you don't want to talk to me in that way, then I think I
should go. 
JASON: Fine. 
TROI: You're welcome to make an appointment to come by my office. 
JASON: Maybe I'll do just that.
