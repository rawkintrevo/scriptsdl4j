TROI LAFORGE WORF SERGEY HELENA CREWWOMAN CRUSHER

[Crusher's quarters]

CRUSHER: So, you'll have a chance to visit the
surface? 
TROI: Maybe. Will and I have been talking about going back to Angel
Falls. 
CRUSHER: Oh, Venezuela's beautiful. 
(doorbell) 
CRUSHER: Come in. 
(A crewman enters with a box. Beverly takes it) 
CRUSHER: Great. Thank you. 
(When she opens it we see the label - Lt Cmdr Jack R Crusher, USS
Stargazer NCC 2893) 
TROI: Something from home? 
CRUSHER: I left it here in storage a long time ago after Jack died.
Odds and ends, mostly. 
TROI: (reading a book title) How to Advance Your Career through
Marriage? 
CRUSHER: It was a joke. Jack sent it to me while I was still in medical
school. It was his way of proposing to me. 
TROI: What's that? 
CRUSHER: It's for Wesley, from Jack. I'd forgotten it. Maybe I was just
trying to forget it. 
TROI: Why? 
CRUSHER: Jack recorded a holographic message to Wesley just after he
was born. It was a gift for when he grew up. Jack was going to make
many more of them. He never had the chance. 
TROI: Are you afraid of what it might say? 
CRUSHER: No, I just don't know if it'll do more harm than good.
Wesley's finally come to terms with his father's death. 
TROI: Wesley has a lot of questions about his father. Things that you
can't answer for him. Perhaps seeing this will help him understand. 
[Engineering]

CREWWOMAN: Check completed, sir. 
SERGEY: So we walked into the school and we don't know what to expect.
Is Worf hurt? Is he in some kind of trouble? The door opens and there
is our little seven year old sitting on a chair and glaring across the
room at five teenage boys, all of them with bloody noses. 
HELENA: And then the principal looked up and said, please tell me he's
an only child. 
WORF: We have taken enough of the Commander's time. 
LAFORGE: No, no, no, we're way ahead of schedule here. 
SERGEY: I just wanted to tell him the story about 
HELENA: Enough stories, Sergey. 
SERGEY: Okay. Okay. Enough stories. Well, how about giving us a look at
the new engine core. I used to be a warp field specialist on the old
Excelsior class. 
LAFORGE: I'd be delighted. Mrs. Rozhenko? 
HELENA: No, no, no, no, no. You two go ahead. Your father will be
hours. Worf, why don't you show me the arboretum? 
WORF: Commander La Forge, call me when you, when my father wishes to
leave. 
SERGEY: I can find my own way. Turbolift four is just over there,
right? I have all the specs and designs at home. 
(Worf and Helena leave) 
LAFORGE: The theta-matrix compositer makes the recrystallisation
process ten times more efficient than the old Excelsior class ships. 
SERGEY: Amazing. Commander, if you have a couple of minutes, there is
something else I want to ask you. 
LAFORGE: Sure, Chief. 
SERGEY: It's about my son.
