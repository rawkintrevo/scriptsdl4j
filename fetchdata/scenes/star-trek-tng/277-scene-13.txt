LAFORGE: Captain, wake up. 
PICARD: Yes. What is it? Have we reached the Neutral Zone? 
LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone? 
PICARD: Sorry. I was in the past again. What's going on? 
LAFORGE: Data's arranged for us to run those tests on you in the
biometrics lab. We're ready to go if you are. 
PICARD: No, no, no. No, we have to get to the Neutral Zone. 
LAFORGE: The Neutral Zone? Why? 
PICARD: In the other two time periods, Starfleet reported a sort of a
spatial anomaly in, in, in the Devron system. In Devron system in the
Neutral Zone. 
LAFORGE: Captain. 
PICARD: If the anomaly appeared there in the past, then it might be
here too and we have to find out. 
LAFORGE: Just because you've seen it in two other time frames, doesn't
mean that it's going to be here. 
PICARD: But if it is here, then it means something. Damn it, Geordi, I
know what we have to do! 
LAFORGE: All right. Okay. But first, there is no Neutral Zone,
remember? 
PICARD: Right. Right. Klingons. In this time period, the Klingons have
taken over the Romulan Empire. 
LAFORGE: Right now relations between us and the Klingons aren't too
cosy. 
PICARD: I know that. I haven't completely lost my mind, you know. 
LAFORGE: Well, if we're going to the Devron system, we're going to need
a ship. 
PICARD: Right. Now, I think it's time to call in some old favours.
Contact Admiral Riker, Starbase two four seven. 
(later) 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to help, but
frankly, what you're asking for is impossible. The Klingons have closed
their borders to all Federation starships. 
PICARD: Will, if this spatial anomaly really is in the Devron System. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: I saw a report from Starfleet Intelligence this
morning on that sector. There is no activity. There is nothing unusual
going on in the Devron system. 
PICARD: Well I don't believe it! What if their long range scanners are
faulty? We have to go there and see for ourselves. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: Look, I've got the Yorktown out near the border.
I'll have her run some long range scans in the Devron System. If she
finds out anything, I'll let you know. 
PICARD: Will, that is just not good enough. 
RIKER [on viewscreen]: It's going to have to be. I'm sorry. It's all I
can do. Riker out. 
DATA: Computer, restore holographic image. 
(back comes the fireplace) 
PICARD: Damn him, anyway. After all we've been through together. He's
been sitting behind that desk too long. 
LAFORGE: Captain, I'm sorry. I guess all we can do now is wait and see
if the Yorktown finds anything. 
DATA: There is another option. We could arrange passage aboard a
medical ship. 
PICARD: Medical ship? 
DATA: Yes, sir. There was an outbreak of Terrellian plague on Romulus.
The Klingons have been allowing Federation medical ships to cross the
border. 
PICARD: Yes. Yes! 
LAFORGE: So, What we need is a medical ship. 
PICARD: I think I can arrange that. Data, find the USS Pasteur. I have
some pull with the Captain. At least, I used to have.
