PICARD: Ensign, manoeuvre us into tractor beam
range. 
RAGER: Aye, sir. 
DATA: Is there a problem, Ensign? 
RAGER: I can't seem to remember how to enter the coordinates, sir. 
RIKER: Ensign Lin. 
DATA: Ready now, Captain. 
PICARD: Report to Sickbay, Ensign Rager. 
PICARD: Ready tractor beam, Mister Worf. 
DATA: Captain, thrusters are losing power. 
PICARD: Impulse engines. Ahead, minimum power. 
LIN: Impulse engines are not responding, sir. 
RIKER: Geordi, what's going on down there? 
LAFORGE [OC]: I don't know, sir. Nothing's responding. 
PICARD: Go to warp engines, factor one. Engage. 
LAFORGE [OC]: Captain 
[Engineering]

LAFORGE: We don't have warp drive either. 
[Bridge]

PICARD: We have no functional propulsion systems? 
DATA: No, sir. Apparently we do not. 
LIN: We're adrift. 
RIKER: Just like the Brittain.

Captain's log, stardate 44639.9. The Enterprise has
now been adrift for a total of ten days. We have sent subspace distress
calls, but because of our distant location, we cannot expect a response
for at least another two weeks.
