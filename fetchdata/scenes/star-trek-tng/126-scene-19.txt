sound sure tired pattern couple intention ain premise proposal

[Guest lounge]

(Data and Sonny are at the food dispenser) 
DATA: Talk. 
SONNY: I'd like me a thick Kansas City steak, and some country fried
potatoes, and a mess of greens. Oh, hell, just forget all that and give
me have a martini, straight up, with two olives. For the vitamins. 
(The glass appears out of thin air. Sonny samples it and whistles) 
DATA: Is there something wrong? 
SONNY: Wrong? Only that your computer here fixed about the best martini
I have ever had. I just might get to like this place. Let's see if the
Braves are on. How do you turn on this teevee? 
RIKER: TV? 
SONNY: Yeah, the boob tube. I'd like to see how the Braves are doing
after all this time. Probably still finding ways to lose. 
DATA: I believe he means television, sir. That particular form of
entertainment did not last much beyond the year two thousand forty. 
SONNY: Well, what do you guys do? I mean, you don't drink, and you
ain't got no TV. Must be kind of boring, ain't it? 
PICARD [OC]: Number One. 
RIKER: Riker here. 
PICARD: Would you and Mister Data report to the Bridge? 
RIKER: At once, sir. 
RALPH: With whom were you speaking? 
RIKER: The Captain. 
RALPH: Good. Would you tell him I would like to see him as soon as it's
convenient? 
CLARE: What's going to happen to us? Do we stay here with you? Do we go
back to Earth? 
RIKER: That will all be up to the Captain. 
RALPH: Well, get him in here. I have to phone Geneva right away about
my accounts. The interest alone could be enough to buy this ship. 
SONNY: The Yankee's right. Let's get the big boy in here. 
RIKER: I'll pass along your request. If you'll excuse us. 
SONNY: Duty calls. Hey, I understand. (to Data) Why don't you come back
later on. You and me'll find us a couple of low mileage pit woofies,
and help'em build a memory.

[Corridor]

DATA: What is to be done with them, sir? 
RIKER: I don't know. 
DATA: Commander, a low mileage pit woofie? 
RIKER: This time you've got me. I haven't a clue. 
DATA: These are the most unusual humans I have ever encountered. 
RIKER: Well, from what I've seen of our guests, there's not much to
redeem them. It makes one wonder how our species survived the
twenty-first century.

[Ready room]

PICARD: Report. 
WORF: We are six hours from the Neutral Zone. I have been unable to
establish communications with any Federation colony or station in this
vicinity. 
PICARD: How many outposts are there in this sector? 
WORF: Nine. 
RIKER: I think we work on the assumption they've all been destroyed. 
LAFORGE: By the Romulans? 
RIKER: It fits their historical pattern. 
DATA: Since we have no contact with the Romulans for fifty three years,
seven months, eighteen days, we must consider that the information we
do have, is out of date. 
RIKER: The positive side of that is the information they have about us
is also out of date. Captain, I think it's that lack of information
that this is all about. 
PICARD: Go on. 
RIKER: In my opinion, the Romulans want a confrontation specifically
with us. 
PICARD: The Enterprise? 
RIKER: Well, not by name, but the Federation. They know the Federation
will send their best. That'll give them a perfect chance to see
firsthand how far we've advanced both in technology and technique. 
PICARD: What are you recommending? 
RIKER: I'm not sure I have a specific recommendation. Perhaps we should
assume the initiative. 
WORF: I agree with Commander Riker. This may be our only opportunity.
We should seize it. 
PICARD: Mister Data? 
DATA: The strategy is built on a single premise. The hostile intent of
the Romulans. If the premise is sound, so is the proposal. 
LAFORGE: If their intention isn't hostile, what is it? 
RALPH [OC]: Captain Picard? 
PICARD: This is Captain Picard. To whom am I speaking? 
RALPH [OC]: Ralph Offenhouse. 
[Guest lounge]

RALPH: I need to talk to you. 
[Ready room]

PICARD: What is going on here, Number One? Did you
give him permission to contact me? 
RIKER: Of course not. He must have seen me use the comm. panel. 
PICARD: Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We're in a very important conference
right now. 
RALPH [OC]: I'm sick and tired of being put off
