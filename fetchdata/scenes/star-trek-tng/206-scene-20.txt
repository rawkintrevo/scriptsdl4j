WESLEY ROBIN WORF PICARD

[Sickbay]

WESLEY: Maybe you should go check again. 
ROBIN: The nurse is still playing the game. 
WESLEY: I don't know what to make of this. There's brain activity all
his systems seem to be working. 
ROBIN: How can that be? He's unconscious. 
WESLEY: Maybe there's a signal breach between his brain and his body.
Let's map his nervous system and see if we can isolate a weak link.
Patch the neural output through to that station. Here. The signal stops
just below his cortex processor. There's some kind of damage. It's
almost undetectable. Let's look at it on the viewer. 
ROBIN: Wesley, look at that. 
WESLEY: It looks like some of his positronic links have been severed. 
ROBIN: The cuts are precise. Look how clean the edges are. Computer,
increase magnification, factor four. 
WESLEY: Only two people on board know enough about Data to do something
like this. Commander La Forge and my mother. 
ROBIN: Why would one of them do this to him? 
WESLEY: Maybe there's more going on here than we thought. What if
someone's trying to use the game for some purpose other than pleasure? 
ROBIN: Then Data would be a threat to that plan. And only with Data out
of the way would everybody become addicted. 
WESLEY: And everyone has. Except us.

WORF: We've reached the designated coordinates,
Captain. There is a ship bearing three two seven mark one five two on
an intercept course. 
PICARD: Advise them of our status, Mister Worf. Go. Replicate what you
need, and see that the devices are properly distributed.
Not forgetting Mister Crusher.
