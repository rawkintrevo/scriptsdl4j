PICARD RIKER DATA

[Bridge]

DATA: Based on its present trajectory, the comet
appears to have originated in the D'Arsay system. 
RIKER: That's over two sectors away. 
DATA: That is correct, sir. This object has been en route for eighty
seven million years. 
RIKER: That's a long time alone in the dark. 
PICARD: Begin a full sensor analysis, Mister Data, and log the findings
with the Federation Astrophysical Survey. 
DATA: Aye, sir. The comet's outer shell is composed primarily of
gaseous hydrogen and helium surrounding an icy mantle. The inner core
consists of heavier elements 
(a bright light sweeps the Bridge) 
PICARD: What was that? 
DATA: There is distortion within the comet's inner core. I believed we
experienced an intense sensor echo. 
RIKER: Can you correct for it? 
DATA: I am attempting to do so now, sir. I have compensated for the
effect. Sensors are reconfigured for a low intensity sweep. We are
still picking up some interference, but the distortion is manageable.
At these settings, the scan will be complete in thirty nine hours.
