[Poker room]

(Data enters the smoke-filled room. Four men sit
around the table. The gambler character is played by Marc Alaimo.) 
GUEST3: Fold. 
MAN: Me too. 
GUEST5: Go to blazes. (and folds) 
GUEST3: A poker face carved in marble. 
DATA: Excuse me, gentlemen. 
GUEST5: What in hell do you want? 
DATA: I would like to join the game. 
GUEST6: Pale face. 
GUEST5: I don't like Easterners, personally. 
DATA: I am a Frenchman. 
GUEST3: Ah. Mes parents sont originaires de Bourgonais. Je suis ne a
la New Orleans. 
DATA: Alors, nous sommes presque frres. Je suis heureux de vous
connaitre. 
GUEST3: Please, sir. 
(Data sits between the man and the seaman) 
GUEST3: The game is poker. The deal is yours. The ante is four bits. 
(Data puts his comm. badge on the table) 
GUEST3: Family heirloom? 
DATA: In a manner of speaking. It is a crystalline composite of
silicon, beryllium, Carbon seventy, and 
GUEST5: Gold. 
DATA: Gold. 
GUEST3: I'll give you three bucks for it. 
DATA: I accept. (and deals)

[Data's hotel room]

(Data has acquired the Native's bowler hat with
feather, and the gambler's fancy waistcoat) 
GUEST1: Did you see the looks on their faces? I did everything I could
not to laugh. 
DATA: To whom are you referring? 
GUEST1: Frederick La Rouque and Joe Falling Hawk. Those guys are card
sharks. Oh sure, they play easy at first not to scare off the marks,
but you give them a little time, they'll bleed a man dry. Especially an
out-of-towner like yourself.. 
DATA: What was the source of your jocular reaction? What was it you
found humorous? 
GUEST1: Don't you see? They had you pegged for a sap. The clothes you
got on, the way you talk, it's like you were born yesterday. You sure
fooled them, though. 
DATA: It was not my intention to deceive. 
GUEST1: Have it your way. This is the place. Breakfast is six to
eight. Checkout's at noon when you're ready to leave. 
(hands over the key and holds out his hand) 
DATA: Thank you. (shakes his hand) It has been a pleasure. 
(the Bellboy coughs) 
DATA: It would be advisable to monitor that cough. I have read that
there is currently a cholera epidemic in San Francisco. 
GUEST1: Never felt better. 
DATA: Of course. The gratuity. Thank you for your assistance. 
GUEST1: A dollar? If there's anything you need. It can get lonely in
San Francisco. You might want some company. I can introduce you to
Lillian. 
DATA: I have no need for companionship. However I do require some
supplies. 
GUEST1: Anything you need. I can get it for you wholesale. I can get
it for you less than wholesale if you don't ask me where it came from. 
(Data has been writing a list) 
GUEST1: What do you need all this stuff for? 
DATA: I am an inventor. 
GUEST1: No kidding. Well, this stuff's going to take a while. I'll
have to go clear cross town. And it's not
going to be cheap. 
(Data takes a wad of notes from his waistcoat pocket) 
DATA: Will this be enough? 
GUEST1: More than enough. 
DATA: You may retain the surplus for yourself. 
GUEST1: Keep the change? 
DATA: Exactly. 
GUEST1: Done.
