TROI HAGAN WORF PICARD RIKER CRUSHER DATA

 [Brittain Bridge]

DATA: There is no malfunction in any of the main
systems, sir. 
(Riker finds the captain dead in her chair, something impaling her
through the chest) 
WORF: Commander. Here's another one. This was done by a phaser on a
setting of six or seven. 
RIKER: And more over here. 
CRUSHER: The entire Bridge crew. 
RIKER: Whoever did this could still be on the ship. 
TROI: There is someone alive, but he didn't kill these people. Here. 
(a door opens) 
TROI: I think he's Betazoid. It's all right. We're going to help you.
Who did this? Who did this to you?

[Sickbay]

CRUSHER: We're almost finished with the autopsies,
Captain. 
PICARD: How long will it take to compile the data? 
CRUSHER: It's complicated. The dead were found all over the ship. Some
were found locked in their rooms, barricaded, with weapons piled all
around them. Others were found in the corridors where they'd obviously
had hand to hand combat. It's going to take some time to analyse and
sort through the details. We've identified him as Andrus Hagan, from
Betazed, scientific advisor. He's in a profound catatonic state. 
TROI: I'm not getting much, Captain. A few words, disconnected phrases.
I can feel his terror but I can't seem to get through to him. 
PICARD: Stay with him, Counsellor. We're examining the Brittain for
clues, but this man is the only one left who knows what happened there.

TROI [OC]: I'm here. I'm right here. 
HAGAN [OC]: Are there voices? 
TROI [OC]: Voices? What do they say? 
HAGAN [OC]: Both things. No. No. 
TROI [OC]: Keep talking to me. I'll try to understand.
