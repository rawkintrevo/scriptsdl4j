[Bridge]

RIKER: Geordi. 
(He has normal eyes) 
LAFORGE: Oh, it's good to see you up and about again, sir. 
RIKER: Your eyes. What happened to your visor? 
LAFORGE: My visor? I'm sorry, sir. Doctor Crusher told us that you
might not remember. I haven't need a visor since I got these cloned
implants, Captain. 
(Worf is at Ops, and a Ferengi at helm) 
WORF: Captain. 
(Data is in a red uniform) 
DATA: Welcome back, Captain. We were not expecting to see you on the
Bridge so soon. 
RIKER: Commander Data. You're my First Officer? 
DATA: Do you remember, sir? 
RIKER: Data, I haven't remembered a day for the last sixteen years. 
WORF: Captain, warbird uncloaking. 
DATA: On screen. 
RIKER: Shields up. Red alert. 
DATA: Captain, we were expecting the Decius. There is no cause for
alarm. 
RIKER: Cancel red alert. Clearly I need to be briefed. 
WORF: Captain, the Decius is hailing us. The Admiral wishes to speak to
you. 
RIKER: On screen. 
(A bearded Picard, and a uniformed Troi by his side) 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Will. 
RIKER: Admiral Picard. Deanna. 
TROI [on viewscreen]: How are you feeling? 
RIKER: I've felt better. 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: Not surprising. Altarian viruses can be a nasty
business. 
RIKER: That's an understatement. I can't even 
PICARD [on viewscreen]: We'll discuss this after we've transport over.
Picard out.

[Turbolift]

RIKER: Transporter room six. 
CRUSHER: How are you holding up? 
RIKER: I could get used to the idea of a Ferengi ensign, but Admiral
Picard on a Romulan warbird? What is that all about? 
CRUSHER: I think I should leave all the explanations to the Admiral.

[Transporter room]

RIKER: Whenever you're ready, Chief. 
(Picard and Troi are beamed aboard) 
PICARD: Captain Riker. it's good to see you have recovered. 
RIKER: I'm not exactly sure you can call it a recovery, sir. 
TROI: Then there has been some memory loss. 
PICARD: How much? 
CRUSHER: Everything since Alpha Onias three.

[Observation lounge]

PICARD: To lose sixteen years. It's almost beyond
belief. 
RIKER: I have trouble believing it myself. 
TROI: It's overwhelming to have so much of your life missing. 
PICARD: And it couldn't have happened at a worse time. A few more days
of relatively simple negotiations, and the treaty will be signed. 
RIKER: What negotiations? What treaty? 
PICARD: Sorry. I'll start at the beginning, which is four years ago. A
Romulan battle cruiser strayed into Federation space. Its warp coils
had collapsed, life support was failing. 
TROI: You saved them, Will, you and the Enterprise. 
PICARD: The Romulans were impressed, to say the least. After years of
distrust and conflict, they started to talk. You were our key spokesman
in securing the alliance with the Romulans. 
RIKER: How far have these negotiations progressed? 
PICARD: The preliminaries are over. All we need do now is escort the
Romulan Ambassador to the final session. 
TROI: Where you will complete the negotiations and sign the treaty. 
RIKER: Captain. Admiral. I am in no condition to negotiate with the
Romulans or with anyone else. 
PICARD: Will, you're sound of mind and body. If you are properly
briefed, you will still be able to fulfill your duty. 
RIKER: With a sixteen year gap in my head? 
PICARD: We do need you. 
RIKER: Sir, I'm not fit to resume command. 
PICARD: I appreciate your candour, but despite your condition there is
no one better equipped to deal with these Romulans than you. 
RIKER: When do we leave? 
PICARD: As soon as the Ambassador transports over from the Decius. We
will get through this, as we have many times before. 
(Picard leaves) 
RIKER: I hope so. 
TROI: Let me take you to your quarters. 
RIKER: Good idea. I've had enough surprises for one day.

[Riker's quarters]

TROI: Anything familiar? 
(a young boy is trying to play 'Three Blind Mice' on the
trombone)
JEAN-LUC: Hi, Dad. 
(a little later, the lad is looking for something) 
JEAN-LUC: and then Mister Greenburg asked about the Fornax Disaster,
and I knew the Enterprise saved all the colonists. But I didn't know.
(spots the PADD) Here it is. But I didn't know the exact stardate their
sun went nova, so of you tell me, I'll write it down and that way I
won't forget. You don't remember me, do you? 
RIKER: I'm sorry. 
TROI: I need to talk to your father, Jean-Luc. Would you mind leaving
us alone for a moment? 
(Jean-Luc goes into his bedroom) 
RIKER: Why didn't you warn me? 
TROI: Beverly hoped that meeting him like this might make an impact.
Help you remember. 
RIKER: Well, it made an impact alright. 
TROI: Give it time. 
RIKER: Jean-Luc. 
TROI: Yes. The Admiral was very pleased when you chose that name. He is
a wonderful boy. 
RIKER: Deanna, who's his mother? 
TROI: She died two years ago. A shuttle accident. I'm sorry, Will. 
RIKER: I have no recollection of her at all. What was she like? 
TROI: Min was beautiful, of course, strong, intelligent, patient. 
RIKER: Well, if she was married to me, she had to be patient.
TROI: She was an excellent Captain's wife, and a very good ship's
counsellor. She took over after I left. 
RIKER: I can't imagine you leaving the Enterprise. 
TROI: Admiral Picard offered me a position at Starfleet Command. It was
a tremendous opportunity. I couldn't refuse. But, what's important
right now, today, is that you have a son who needs you. Spend time with
him. You may find part of what you've lost. 
(Troi leaves) 
[Jean-Luc's room]

(He's at the trombone again) 
JEAN-LUC: Pretty bad, huh? 
RIKER: I've heard better. 
JEAN-LUC: I've been practicing but I still can't get a good tone. 
RIKER: You're putting too much pressure on the mouthpiece. Relax the
embouchure. Don't use any muscles you don't need. 
JEAN LUC: Show me again. 
RIKER: Left hand. Right hand. 
(does a quick scale, then goes into Misty, and gets the 'helpless' note
wrong again) 
RIKER: Sixteen years, you'd think I'd be able to hit that note. 
JEAN LUC: Come on, Dad, you always make that mistake.

[Riker's quarters]

RIKER: Computer. Summarise service record. Riker,
William T, Captain. Begin with the Fornax disaster. 
COMPUTER: Please restate question. 
RIKER: Service record, Riker, William T. 
(nothing) 
RIKER: Damn it. 
JEAN-LUC: Dad? 
RIKER: Computer lag. I can't believe Geordi's still running his
diagnostic. 
(finally something comes up on the desk monitor) 
JEAN-LUC: Is that what you wanted? 
PICARD [OC]: Picard to Captain Riker. The Romulan Ambassador is ready
to transport over from the Decius. 
RIKER: On my way. I'd better go. 
JEAN-LUC: Sure. Dad. Everything's going to be fine.

[Corridor]

PICARD: Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc. How's my
namesake holding up to all this? 
RIKER: Better than I am. 
TROI: We did our best to prepare him. 
RIKER: I'm trying to catch up with all this. I've still got a long way
to go. A long way. 
PICARD: Just follow my lead with the Ambassador. You'll be fine.
